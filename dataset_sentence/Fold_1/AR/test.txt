Sanders releases $16 trillion 'Green New Deal' plan, promises it will 'pay for itself' Democratic 2020 hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday released his plan for a Green New Deal – promising that the multitrillion-dollar plan to radically overhaul the economy and combat climate change will "pay for itself" over the next 15 years." s president, Bernie Sanders will launch the decade of the Green New Deal, a ten-year, nationwide mobilization centered around justice and equity during which climate change will be factored into virtually every area of policy, from immigration to trade to foreign policy and beyond," his campaign said in a press release. SANDERS CALLS FOR 'REGISTRY OF DISREPUTABLE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS,' CUTTING PRISON POPULATION IN HALFThe Vermont senator has long been an advocate for the Green New Deal, but only this year has it become a central policy for many of those seeking the Democratic nomination for president. This year, it was given a big push in Congress when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., introduced a formal resolution on it – which stalled in the Senate but drew support from a number of 2020 hopefuls. All versions of such plans have gone beyond direct energy-related policies, instead seeking to overhaul the economy and society at large. Sanders' plan is no different, promising that he will "generate the political will necessary for a wholesale transformation of our society" and proposing $16.3 trillion in public investments. In addition to promises that include reaching 100 percent renewable energy by 2030 and decarbonization by 2050 and ending unemployment by creating 20 million "good paying" jobs tied to clean energy, Sanders claims he will save families money with a host of policies -- including launching universal high-speed Internet, weatherizing homes, building new public transportation and rebuilding America's infrastructure. Among those promises are a $681 billion program for families and small businesses to trade in old vehicles for newer, more energy-efficient motors – a souped-up version of the Obama administration-era "Cash for Clunkers" program. He also promises "justice for frontline communities" via a $40 billion "Climate Justice Resiliency Fund" as well as an extra $200 billion to the Green Climate Fund. The plan also promises support for the "climate justice movement" to take on the fossil fuel industry and other polluters and "lead the globe in solving the climate crisis." In a nod to the social justice part of the plan, he says that the deal is an "opportunity to uproot historical injustices and inequities to advance social, racial, and economic justice, including redressing the exclusion of black, brown, Native American and other vulnerable communities from the programs that made up the original New Deal." But the White House hopeful also promises that the plan will pay for itself over 16 years, saying experts have scored the plan and its economic effects. According to the campaign, revenue will be generated via a host of measures, including slapping the fossil fuel industry with fees, litigation and taxes, and generating revenue from the sale of energy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPFurther sources of revenue or savings include tax revenue from the proposed 20 million jobs, higher taxes on the wealthy, lower military spending, and a reduced need for welfare spending "due to the creation of millions of good-paying, unionized jobs." Any such plan is unlikely to get any Republican support -- and would almost certainly rely entirely on Democrats having strong majorities in both the House and Senate should Sanders win the nomination and the presidency.

Last year's increase was 50% higher than the average of the past 10 years. Researchers say a combination of human activities and the El Niño weather phenomenon drove CO2 to a level not seen in 800,000 years. This year's greenhouse gas bulletin produced by the WMO, is based on measurements taken in 51 countries. Research stations dotted around the globe measure concentrations of warming gases including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. The figures published by the WMO are what's left in the atmosphere after significant amounts are absorbed by the Earth's "sinks", which include the oceans and the biosphere.2016 saw average concentrations of CO2 hit 403.3 parts per million, up from 400ppm in 2015." It is the largest increase we have ever seen in the 30 years we have had this network," Dr Oksana Tarasova, chief of WMO's global atmosphere watch programme, told BBC News." The largest increase was in the previous El Niño, in 1997-1998 and it was 2.7ppm and now it is 3.3ppm, it is also 50% higher than the average of the last ten years." El Niño impacts the amount of carbon in the atmosphere by causing droughts that limit the uptake of CO2 by plants and trees. Emissions from human sources have slowed down in the last couple of years according to research, but according to Dr Tarasova, it is the cumulative total in the atmosphere that really matters as CO2 stays aloft and active for centuries. Over the past 70 years, says the report, the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere is nearly 100 times larger than it was at the end of the last ice age. Rapidly increasing atmospheric levels of CO2 and other gases have the potential, according to the study to "initiate unpredictable changes in the climate system... leading to severe ecological and economic disruptions." The study notes that since 1990 there has been a 40% increase in total radiative forcing, that's the warming effect on our climate of all greenhouse gases." Geological-wise, it is like an injection of a huge amount of heat," said Dr Tarasova." The changes will not take ten thousand years like they used to take before, they will happen fast - we don't have the knowledge of the system in this state, that is a bit worrisome!"According to experts, the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was three to five million years ago, in the mid-Pliocene era. The climate then was 2-3C warmer, and sea levels were 10-20m higher due to the melting of Greenland and the West Antarctic ice sheets. Other experts in the field of atmospheric research agreed that the WMO findings were a cause for concern." The 3ppm CO2 growth rate in 2015 and 2016 is extreme - double the growth rate in the 1990-2000 decade," Prof Euan Nisbet from Royal Holloway University of London told BBC News." It is urgent that we follow the Paris agreement and switch rapidly away from fossil fuels: there are signs this is beginning to happen, but so far the air is not yet recording the change." Another concern in the report is the continuing, mysterious rise of methane levels in the atmosphere, which were also larger than the average over the past ten years. Prof Nisbet says there is a fear of a vicious cycle, where methane drives up temperatures which in turn releases more methane from natural sources." The rapid increase in methane since 2007, especially in 2014, 2015, and 2016, is different. This was not expected in the Paris agreement. Methane growth is strongest in the tropics and sub-tropics. The carbon isotopes in the methane show that growth is not being driven by fossil fuels. We do not understand why methane is rising. It may be a climate change feedback. It is very worrying." The implications of these new atmospheric measurements for the targets agreed under the Paris climate pact, are quite negative, say observers." The numbers don't lie. We are still emitting far too much and this needs to be reversed," said Erik Solheim, head of UN Environment." We have many of the solutions already to address this challenge. What we need now is global political will and a new sense of urgency." The report has been issued just a week ahead of the next instalment of UN climate talks, in Bonn. Despite the declaration by President Trump that he intends to take the US out of the deal, negotiators meeting in Germany will be aiming to advance and clarify the rulebook of the Paris agreement.

Both lawmakers were responding to a question asked by Axios' Amy Harder during the event. Most Republicans oppose a carbon tax, though a handful have joined oil and gas majors and Democrats to push carbon tax proposals. The most recent high-profile carbon tax effort was led by former Florida GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo, who introduced a bill to use emissions taxes to fund the federal Highway Trust Fund. However, Curbelo's policy went nowhere in the House and he lost his re-election bid in 2018.

858	Breitbart	questionable_source	2017-10-26	Yet not only is pollution control not getting better, in many parts of the world, "pollution is getting worse," the Lancet study found.	Pollution is not only the largest environmental cause of disease and premature death in the world today, the study found, but diseases caused by pollution were responsible for roughly 16 percent of all deaths worldwide: "three times more deaths than from AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined and 15 times more than from all wars and other forms of violence."	Moreover, a devastating new study from the prestigious UK-based Lancet journal has revealed that pollution-related diseases—rather than "climate change"—were responsible for an estimated 9 million premature deaths in 2015, or some 15 times more than from all wars and other forms of violence combined.	As environmental activists jet around the world complaining of "carbon footprints" and preaching "renewable energy," they have been remarkably silent regarding the real and present menace that is wiping out millions of human beings around the world.	Most signatories, Solomon notes in an essay in last Friday's Financial Post, "are ignoring, if not altogether abandoning Paris commitments, undoubtedly because voters in large part put no stock in scary global warming scenarios."		IMF Chief: We Will Be 'Toasted, Roasted and Grilled' by Global Warming If we don't address the issues of climate change and inequality, Ms. Lagarde said Tuesday before a major economic conference in Riyadh, "we will be moving to a dark future." Speaking directly to the question of global warming, Lagarde said that "we will be toasted, roasted and grilled" if humanity fails to make "critical decisions" regarding carbon emissions. If the human race wants a future that "looks like utopia and not dystopia," it needs to address such concerns, Lagarde said, predicting that in 50 years' time, oil will be a secondary commodity since green energy will have moved into prominence. Speaking before a major petroleum-producing nation, Lagarde hastened to add that these necessary measures are "well understood" in Saudi Arabia. Ms. Lagarde is no stranger to exaggerated predictions, having proposed in 2016 that a Brexit victory would lead to 500,000 job losses, while suggesting that Brexit voters are narrow-minded and calling for a "united Europe." Ms. Lagarde said she had always admired Britain's "openness to other nationalities and cultures" and added it was "hard to believe attitudes had changed in such a short space of time." In June, President Donald Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord, arguing that it was a deeply flawed document that put American workers at an economic disadvantage. This announcement drew fierce criticism from world leaders and activists, with former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon accusing Trump of "standing on the wrong side of history." Recent reports, however, suggest that Trump's move has drawn numerous countries in his wake, with a number of other nations quietly withdrawing from the Paris energy goals. According to Lawrence Solomon of Energy Probe, a Toronto-based environmental organization, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is one of the only signers of the Paris agreement who is actually abiding by the exacting demands of the accord. Most signatories, Solomon notes in an essay in last Friday's Financial Post, "are ignoring, if not altogether abandoning Paris commitments, undoubtedly because voters in large part put no stock in scary global warming scenarios." Moreover, a devastating new study from the prestigious UK-based Lancet journal has revealed that pollution-related diseases—rather than "climate change"—were responsible for an estimated 9 million premature deaths in 2015, or some 15 times more than from all wars and other forms of violence combined. Pollution is not only the largest environmental cause of disease and premature death in the world today, the study found, but diseases caused by pollution were responsible for roughly 16 percent of all deaths worldwide: "three times more deaths than from AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined and 15 times more than from all wars and other forms of violence." So while there has not yet been a single documented case of a person being killed by carbon dioxide related "global warming," real pollution of air, water and land is killing an average of 25,000 people every day across the globe. As environmental activists jet around the world complaining of "carbon footprints" and preaching "renewable energy," they have been remarkably silent regarding the real and present menace that is wiping out millions of human beings around the world. Whereas the Paris Climate Accord prates about greenhouse gas emissions, it never once mentions the word "pollution" in the entire 27-page document. Yet not only is pollution control not getting better, in many parts of the world, "pollution is getting worse," the Lancet study found.	False

The Resistance More and more Americans are coming to the conclusion that climate change is no myth at a time when the Trump administration is intent on ignoring reality and appeasing corporate interests. Some environmental leaders are responding by formulating a lowest common denominator strategy on climate, like revenue neutral approaches, hoping to magically create a middle ground by bowing to the altar of limited government. Fortunately, an inclusive, inter-sectional and organic resistance is rising. This spring, throughout a week of powerful demonstrations from Earth Day to May Day, this resistance will blossom. OneAmerica is a multi-issue immigrant rights organization that calls Washington state – aka the Center of the Resistance – home. Our communities are as harmed in the short term by ICE raids and unconstitutional travel bans as they are in the long term by gutted environmental regulations. To fight these destructive and unpopular attacks, we need everyone, but more importantly, we need to follow the leadership of those most impacted by these regulatory rollbacks and programmatic cuts. People across the country overwhelmingly support action on climate and investment in renewable energy sources, and believe immigrants make the United States a better place to live. In partnership with our allies among labor, environmental, faith, and progressive business groups, OneAmerica has worked with other organizations led by people of color to build a statewide movement for action on climate change that puts our communities and other front line communities first. Our communities, to quote environmental justice advocate Majora Carter, are the canaries in the coal mine: We have already begun to experience climate disruption by virtue of where we live and work, and we have always been on the front lines of pollution. Farm worker communities in Eastern Washington have worked through several severely hot summers, under threat of wildfires and job loss due to drought. In the Puget Sound region, some of the zip codes with the lowest life expectancy and highest pollution burdens are home to large and growing Latino and Asian Pacific American communities.

Andrew Cuomo's support. Yates town councilman John Riggi opposes Apex Clean Energy's plan to build a 200-megawatt wind turbine project over the objections of local officials and a majority of voters. Riggi says he's not opposed to green energy, but doesn't want it nearby if his constituents don't support it. He wrote an editorial in a local paper this week pledging to accept "no quarter" in the fight against the Lighthouse Wind farm." he main concern is the desires of the constituency who are massively opposed to this project," Riggi told The Daily Caller New Foundation. "It is like 87 percent opposed." Cuomo plans to drastically increase New York's wind power capacity as part of his effort to phase out fossil fuels. Cuomo wants New York to get 50 percent of its electricity from green energy source by 2030. Cuomo did not return requests for comment to TheDCNF." ome of these turbines would be 750 feet high," Riggi said. "They want to put 70 of them in a 24 square mile area." It would completely change the community into something very different from how it feels," Riggi said. "People live here because they like rural living. They don't want their areas turned into industrialized zones." Lighthouse Wind could also run into opposition from environmentalists, who are increasingly turning against wind power at the local level. Environmentalists have become concerned with wind powers impact on birds and bats. Wind farms kill an estimated 573,000 birds and 888,000 bats a year, according to a 2013 peer-reviewed study published in Wildlife Society Bulletin. Wind farms are projected to kill 1.4 million birds annually by 2030." his area sits astride the preeminent bird and avian flyway on the North American continent," Riggi said. "We have birds coming in massive amounts. There's an issue with that. It's a danger to the birds and bats." Wind farms kill an estimated 573,000 birds each year, as well as 888,000 bats, according to a 2013 peer-reviewed study published in Wildlife Society Bulletin. Wind farms are projected to kill 1.4 million birds annually by 2030." pex Clean Energy also works to ensure that our projects are responsibly sited for wildlife by conducting in-depth environmental impact studies for every project," Cat Strumlauf, a spokesperson for Apex, told TheDCNF. "At every stage of development and operation, we coordinate with federal and state wildlife agencies to make sure that our projects are sited in areas where impacts to birds or bats are minimized and appropriately mitigated if necessary." The project could harm with the region's economy, potentially creating problems for a nearby U.S. Air Force base." e also have an Air Force base 30 miles from the proposed project site," Riggi said. "The base is concerned about the wind project because it would mess with the radar. We have an aerial refueling and drone mission there. It could impact how they're performing as well." The wind farm could make a nearby military base, which is a critical part of the local economy, much less useful. The base pump $200 million a year into the region and employs over 2,600 people." pex Clean Energy takes the safety and readiness of our military very seriously, and we work closely with the Department of Defense and its services to ensure our wind energy facilities do not adversely impact military missions," Strumlauf said. Riggi is also worried about the health concerns involving wind turbines. One of most common complaints about wind turbines by local residents is that they cause "flickering" when the sun is behind their blades. This is generally agreed to be incredibly annoying and there's evidence that it can cause headaches, sleep disorders, anxiety and depression symptoms in people who live nearby. Finally, Riggi is concerned Cuomo's green goals give local government's very little flexibility to determine how they go green." ne of the thing the governor is very clear on is that he wants all towns to become more green," Riggi told TheDCNF. "What I don't understand is with all of this going on why would the governor not allow the towns to choose how they'll support this initiative. There's no flexibility." New York state currently gets less than 5 percent of its electricity from wind and solar, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). That's a long way from Cuomo's 50 percent by 2030 target." o we want to reduce our carbon footprint?," Riggi said. "Certainly. But we're not being given the option of deciding how to do it ourselves. We're full in on renewable energy, but the town wants to have a choice. We want to be the ones to make the decisions on how we're going to contribute."

424	cnn	left_bias	2018-11-26	An earlier portion of the climate change report was released in November 2017 and found "no convincing alternative explanation" for the changing climate other than "human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases."	Another impact of climate change will be on the health of Americans, whether because of extreme heat and higher temperatures, diseases (like Zika) that come from mosquitoes and ticks, more food and waterborne diseases, or higher risk of asthma and allergies.	Over half (53%) of voters in the August Quinnipiac poll said climate change is a factor in making fires more extreme.	In a statement by White House deputy press secretary Lindsey Walters, the Trump administration downplayed the report, saying it "is largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that despite strong economic growth that would increase greenhouse gas emissions, there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population."	Fewer Republicans (one third) said more should be done about climate change, and another third of Republicans thought that the US is doing enough to address climate change.		Americans are worried about climate change (CNN) The new government report on climate change, which the Trump administration released quietly a day after Thanksgiving and two days after President Donald Trump tweeted skeptically about the existence of climate change, warns that the drastic human effects on the climate could cause thousands of Americans to die and cost the US economy hundreds of billions of dollars. But even before the report was made public, Americans were extremely worried about climate change. Almost two-thirds (64%) of voters said the US needs to be doing more to address climate change, according to a poll by Quinnipiac University in August, up from 57% who said the same in December 2015This opinion is divided by party lines: 91% of Democrats said more should be done, and 67% of independents agreed. Fewer Republicans (one third) said more should be done about climate change, and another third of Republicans thought that the US is doing enough to address climate change. In the December 2015 Quinnipiac poll , 83% of Democrats thought the US should be doing more, compared to 62% of independents and 26% of Republicans. The Trump administration chose to speed up release of the new report, which is required by law, putting it out on Black Friday instead of in December. It also came two days after Trump issued another tweet transmitting his skepticism of the existence of Climate change." Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming?" he said Wednesday on Twitter. An earlier portion of the climate change report was released in November 2017 and found "no convincing alternative explanation" for the changing climate other than "human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases." Trump has stood by his years-old claim that climate change is a hoax and emphasized that belief with his statements about the California wildfires , which he said were a result of poor forest management, drawing criticism from firefighters, climate scientists and many others. The government report, which is called the National Climate Assessment , addressed wildfires, reporting that one impact of climate change will be longer and more destructive wildfires, that could burn up to six times more forest annually by 2050 in parts of the US. California's wildfires are the worst in the state's history. Over half (53%) of voters in the August Quinnipiac poll said climate change is a factor in making fires more extreme. At that point, the fires in California were only beginning, and some are still burning in November, so it's unclear whether that number has changed since August. Eight-in-10 Democrats, 54% of independents, and 22% of Republicans thought in August that climate change has an impact the fires. Another impact of climate change will be on the health of Americans, whether because of extreme heat and higher temperatures, diseases (like Zika) that come from mosquitoes and ticks, more food and waterborne diseases, or higher risk of asthma and allergies. Concern about climate change and global warming has gone up in the last few years -- from 33% who said they worry a great deal about it in March 2013 to 43% who say the same now, according to GallupAround the same number (45%) said they think global warming will pose a serious threat to them or their way of life in their lifetimes in the March poll. That's up from 2010, when Gallup first asked it and only a third of Americans thought global warming would impact them. Democrats are much more likely to think they'll be impacted (67%) than independents (45%) or Republicans (18%), but whether that's because more Democrats live in coastal regions or due to just plain partisanship, it's hard to tell. In a statement by White House deputy press secretary Lindsey Walters, the Trump administration downplayed the report, saying it "is largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that despite strong economic growth that would increase greenhouse gas emissions, there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population."

Says Green Guru James Lovelock So says James Lovelock, 98, one of the world's pre-eminent environmentalists in a wide-ranging interview on today's Delingpole podcast for Breitbart. Lovelock is probably best known in environmental circles as the progenitor of Gaia theory – the idea that the planet is a self-regulating, living organism. In 2006, he boosted his green credibility even further with his bestselling book The Revenge of Gaia, whose doomsday narrative predicted that by 2100 climate change would have wiped out 80 percent of the world's population. But Lovelock has since renounced this view. Though he still thinks carbon dioxide is a problem because of its warming effects on the climate, he now believes the threat is not immediate. His change of heart was brought about partly by being in Oslo when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. He was not impressed by the calibre of the scientists attached to the IPCC – least of all its then-head Rajendra Pachauri "who turned out to be somewhat corrupt." There is global warming. But the stupid bloody academics screwed it up," he says now – meaning that they got their sums wrong and exaggerated the speed with which the planet is warming.A bigger worry, he says, are the wrong-headed policies being introduced supposedly to combat "climate change." He particularly loathes wind turbines because they are expensive, inefficient and environmentally damaging. The only reason they are being built, he says, is because "there is so much money in renewable energy. I'm sure there's giant corruption going on." The solution, he argues, is nuclear power which has had a terrible press because of green propaganda most likely funded by fossil fuel industries. Nuclear's health risks have been exaggerated by credulous greens who say "there's no amount of radiation that can't give you cancer." But this is nonsense, says Lovelock." t's as stupid as saying you should never go out of your home because if you do there's a chance you'll be killed by something or other." He feels the same way about the scare about pesticides, which greens have been heavily promoting ever since Rachel Carson's eco-doom bestseller Silent Spring, published in 1962. It was Lovelock who invented the device – an Electron Capture Detector – used to measure the tiniest quantities of substances be they pesticides or CFCs. What this device showed is that, yes, pesticides have indeed become so embedded in the food chain that they are detectable in every living thing." his has made the Greens very happy" he says, because it seems to confirm all their worst suspicions about pollutants, chemicals and health hazards. But it shouldn't, he adds, because – with certain exceptions – they are not a problem." he fact that this stuff is there, measured in picograms or fractions of a picogram, is of no consequence to people," he says. Lovelock's remarks are unlikely to endear him to the green movement. His Gaia hypothesis, first formulated in the 1960s while he was working with NASA trying to establish how to detect life on Mars, has inspired many people to join the green religion. And even – like actress Emma Thompson – to name their daughter after it. But far, far worse in many environmentalists' eyes will be the unlikely revelation he confided to me over lunch: he's a great admirer of Donald Trump, whom he recognises as a fellow maverick.	True

New UN Report Suggests Carbon Pricing A United Nations special climate report suggests a tax on carbon dioxide emissions would need to be as high as $27,000 per ton at the end of the century to effectively limit global warming. For Americans, that's the same as a $240 per gallon tax on gasoline in the year 2100, should such a recommendation be adopted. In 2030, the report says a carbon tax would need to be as high as $5,500 — that's equivalent to a $49 per gallon gas tax. If you think that's an unlikely scenario, you're probably not wrong. However, it's what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's report, released Sunday night, sees as a policy option for reducing emissions enough to keep projected warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The IPCC's report is meant to galvanize political support for doubling down on the Paris climate accord ahead of a U.N. climate summit scheduled for December. The report calls for societal changes that are "unprecedented in terms of scale" in order to limit future global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius, the stretch goal of the Paris accord. However, the costs of meeting that goal are high based on the IPCC's own figures. (RELATED: Here's What The Media Won't Tell You About The U.N.'s New Climate Report)In order to effectively keep future warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, the IPCC says carbon taxes would need to range from $135 to $5,500 per ton in 2030, $245 to $13,000 per ton in 2050, $420 to $17,000 per ton in 2070 and $690 to $27,000 per ton in 2100. To meet the goals of the Paris accord, which seeks to limit future warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, the IPCC says carbon taxes would have range between $10 and $200 in 2030 and $160 and $2,125 in 2100. That's equivalent to a gas tax as high as $1.70 per gallon in 2030 to nearly $19 per gallon at the end of the century. That's less onerous than limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, but still no walk in the park. California and many European countries have policies to price carbon dioxide emissions and mandate green energy, including cap-and-trade systems and carbon taxes. But carbon prices under those systems are nowhere near where the IPCC says they need to be. The IPCC said the "price of carbon would need to increase significantly when a higher level of stringency is pursued." However, the group's report tacitly acknowledges the unlikelihood that governments will enact astronomical taxes on energy." hile the price of carbon is central to prompt mitigation pathways compatible with 1.5 [degree Celsius]-consistent pathways, a complementary mix of stringent policies is required," reads the IPCC's report. In the U.S., Republican lawmakers overwhelmingly passed a resolution opposed to carbon taxes in July. Democrats called for a price on carbon dioxide in their 2016 party platform, but they haven't made much effort on that front since the failure of cap-and-trade legislation in 2010. Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida introduced carbon tax legislation shortly after all but five of his GOP colleagues in the House voted to oppose such a bill. Curbelo's bill would tax carbon dioxide at $23 a ton — nowhere near what the IPCC calls for. However, the IPCC suggested a lower carbon tax could be used in conjunction with command and control policies, like regulations and bans on coal plants, could achieve "generate a 1.5˚C pathway for the U.S. electric sector." But that point only serves to undermine Curbelo's bill, which would put a moratorium on some environmental regulations and possibly eliminate some if emissions goals are reached. The IPCC noted the "literature indicates that the pricing of emissions is relevant but needs to be complemented with other policies to drive the required changes in line with 1.5°C-consistent cost-effective pathways."

Thunberg vs Trump: Showdown at UNGA sparks memes & snark Arriving at the UN General Assembly, US President Donald Trump paid no attention to Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg. Caught on camera, her stare sparked a thousand tweets and divided the public. While Thunberg was giving a fiery speech at the UNGA Climate Action Summit, Trump was speaking at an event about religious freedom. Video from the UN headquarters on East River shows Thunberg scowling as Trump enters the building to speak to reporters, not even registering her presence. Trump's critics were quick to make Thunberg their "shero,"describing her stare their new "life goals" and declaring that the 16-year-old climate activist "became president today." We are all Greta," another resistance activist proclaimed, sharing a photo of Thunberg scowling at Trump next to a photo of her meeting his predecessor, Barack Obama. Conservatives who saw the images reacted differently, praising Trump for ignoring Thunberg – as if he did it on purpose – and even meme-ing her scowl to music and song lyrics. Trump has nixed dozens of Obama administration environmental regulations, calling them deadly to the economy, much to the outrage of climate activists. A faction among the Democrats has since proposed a "Green New Deal" that would eliminate carbon emissions altogether and reorder the US economy entirely, warning that otherwise the world would end in 12 years. Thunberg is even more pessimistic. At the current rate, the world will go over the carbon emissions cap in eight and a half years, she warned in her speech on Monday." You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words," she thundered at the world leaders on Monday. "People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing.

G7 officials fail to agree statement on climate change G7 energy ministers have failed to agree a statement on climate change this afternoon because of 'US reservations', it has emerged. Top officials from the Group of Seven industrial nations gathered in Rome, Italy today amid growing concerns over the US administration's moves to unravel policies aimed at stalling global warming. Environmental activists fear US President Donald Trump is dismantling Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, which aimed at reducing carbon pollution from power plants. Greenpeace was holding a sit-in outside Monday's meeting, calling on officials to maintain their commitments to reduce greenhouse gases under the 2015 Paris Agreement. However, the US 'reserved its position' on the text about commitments made by G7 countries under the Paris accord, said Carlo Calenda, the Italian minister for economic development, who chaired the meeting in Rome. The ministers' agenda had called for discussion of energy security, policies to move away from coal, natural gas routes and supply, sustainable development of electricity sources, alternative fuel scenarios and energy access and investments in Africa. Lacking unanimity, Italy, which currently presides the Group of Seven, decided against proposing the joint statement, Calenda said. The Paris Agreement, endorsed by members of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is a bedrock of international action against man-made global warming. It vows to cap warming to 'well below' two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to late 19th-century levels - an effort that scientists say will require massive cuts in carbon emissions from coal and other fossil fuels. It also pledges to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in aid for poor countries badly exposed to drought, flood, rising seas and other climate impacts. In March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order rolling back some of the previous Democratic administration's policies on carbon emissions and climate change. Experts have said his plan, which eases emissions limits for coal-fired power plants and scraps more stringent vehicle pollution standards, almost guarantees that the US will fail to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement. Trump has also said he does not intend to honour promises made by the administration of his predecessor, Barack Obama, to provide financial aid under the Paris accord. However, Trump's team is also deeply divided on whether to withdraw from the pact, according to US media reports. On March 30, the White House said a decision on whether to withdraw would be made ahead of the G7 summit in Italy in late May. Under Obama, the United States, the second biggest carbon polluter, provided critical impetus for the Paris deal by concluding a precursor deal with China, the number one emitter. The Group of Seven, gathering the biggest western democracies, comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.	True

Elizabeth Warren Zeroes In On Climate Change Ahead Of Next Debate But the Massachusetts senator's campaign is ramping up its focus on the climate crisis ahead of Thursday night's debate in Los Angeles, where wildfires forced more than 40,000 to flee their homes less than two months ago. Last week, Warren unveiled her "Blue New Deal," the first comprehensive campaign proposal to revitalize coastal economies by fortifying ports, spurring new markets for seafood and completely overhauling the offshore energy industry. On Wednesday, she published an op-ed outlining how she'd target fossil fuel companies and reverse President Donald Trump's assault on environmental regulations during her first 100 days in the White House. Then, on Thursday, the campaign announced an endorsement from Rhiana Gunn-Wright, the policy researcher who helped write the Green New Deal resolution Warren co-sponsored in the Senate in February." here is no dealing with climate change unless we deal with corruption," Gunn-Wright said in a video set to be released Thursday afternoon. "Every time I read a Warren climate plan, I am confident that it can take us to a Green New Deal, because I see her thinking about: How do we use all the levers of government?"The endorsement comes as Warren is sliding in national polls, which commentators have largely attributed to her apparent wobbling on "Medicare for All." The loss of her brief front-runner status this fall is widely seen as aiding the surge of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on her left and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg on her right. Yet Warren's shift on climate could position her to be more competitive against Sanders, who has made his own push on the issue over the past month and picked up major endorsements from youth activists. Warren and Sanders have taken different approaches on climate. Warren has put out more than half a dozen individual plans to spend a combined $3 trillion on solving specific issues like spurring a green manufacturing boom and transitioning the military off fossil fuels. Sanders, by contrast, has released a $16.3 trillion megaproposal for a Green New Deal that includes everything from creating a public option for electricity to spending nearly $15 billion to encourage worker-owned grocery stores. Yet Warren trails Sanders only slightly on climate, according to green groups' rankings. Greenpeace graded her an A and Sanders an A+. On a scale of 200, the Sunrise Movement, the group that pushed the Green New Deal into the mainstream, scored Warren at 168 and Sanders at 183. 350 Action gave both candidates three thumbs up. Sanders has picked up endorsements from the teen-led U.S. Youth Climate Strike and 18-year-old activist Jamie Margolin. He's also backed by Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), the star first-term Democrats who proposed the first two major pieces of Green New Deal legislation last month. (Sanders sponsored the Senate version of Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal for Public Housing bill last month). But the starkest contrast on the issue is between the two progressive contenders and their moderate rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden and Buttigieg. Biden's campaign is stacked with gas industry allies. Buttigieg's climate adviser, David Victor, has been called a "fossil fuel shill" for taking research funding from an oil giant and deflecting blame from the industry. It's unclear how much average voters care about a candidate's green credentials when the ability to defeat Trump, who is widely criticized as a climate change denier, is a foremost concern for Democrats and independents who lean left. Climate was the No. 2 concern after health care for Iowa caucusgoers in a Monmouth University survey from April. In California, nearly half of Democratic primary voters said climate should be the top issue for the next president, according to a Los Angeles Times poll published this month. The trend bears out nationally. About 38% of registered voters favored a Green New Deal proposal that spends upward of $10 trillion slashing climate-changing emissions by 2030, according to an August nationwide survey commissioned by the left-leaning think tank Data for Progress. That compared to 32.5% who preferred a $1.7 trillion plan to zero out emissions by 2050 ― more in line with what Biden proposed.	True

Cyclone Kenneth struck the southern African nation last week with winds of 220km/h (140mph), flattening villages and damaging thousands more homes. The storm lost strength, but torrential rain was still battering the area on Monday, with more expected. As a result, flights have been grounded - hindering the aid effort. It is predicted the weather system will dump twice as much rainfall as Cyclone Idai, which struck last month, leaving more than 900 dead across Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. The flood risk was compounded by Kenneth hitting at the end of the rainy season when river levels were already high, the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) noted. Already, Pemba, the regional capital of Cabo Delgado state, has experienced more than 2m (6.5ft) of rain and flooding. According to Mozambique's National Institute of Disaster Management (INGC), 38 people have been killed by Cyclone Kenneth, while another 35,000 homes have been destroyed or damaged. The privately-owned O Pais website reported five people died after part of a rubbish dump collapsed onto homes in Pemba on Sunday evening. It is unclear if these deaths are recorded in the government total. Ocha says humanitarian needs "have sky-rocketed, and the humanitarian response will need to rapidly scale up". Some 200,000 people are in danger in Pemba alone, Ocha warned. Spokesman Saviano Abreu added that the situation in the northern towns of Macomia and Quissanga was critical, while there were also worries for the cut-off island of Ibo. But attempts to reach those areas had not been entirely successful." We managed to send one flight with World Food Programme (WFP) supplies of rice and biscuits, and some non-food items," Mr Abreu told news agency AFP." But unfortunately the weather conditions are changing too fast and threatening the operation. It's raining again and the second flight couldn't go." This satellite image shows the cyclone over northern Mozambique and Tanzania on Friday night. On Sunday a spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was appealing for "additional resources" from the international community "to fund the response in the immediate, medium and longer term". Tropical cyclones in this part of the Indian Ocean are not that rare. However, according to the BBC's Environment Correspondent Matt McGrath, Cyclone Idai was the seventh such major storm of the Indian Ocean season when it struck back in March. That is more than double the average for the time of year. What's even more unusual, however, is the fact Idai and Kenneth hit in such quick succession. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), "there is no record of two storms of such intensity striking Mozambique in the same season". It is especially unusual in the context of the trend which has seen tropical cyclones in the region decrease slightly over the past seven decades. But it is far too early - and too small a sample size - to say whether this frequency is a direct result of climate change. Instead, experts point to other elements making the storm's impact worse which they know are related to climate change." There is absolutely no doubt that when there is a tropical cyclone like this, then because of climate change the rainfall intensities are higher," Dr Friederike Otto, from the University of Oxford, told the BBC in the aftermath of Cyclone Idai." And also because of sea-level rise, the resulting flooding is more intense than it would be without human-induced climate change." Cabo Delgado province is not as densely populated as the area hit by Cyclone Idai, and there is apparently more high ground there. That, in addition to warnings by authorities ahead of the storm, could significantly stem losses compared with Cyclone Idai. But reports said many thousands of homes had been flattened by the winds, and the area has been hit by militant Islamist violence in recent months, which could complicate humanitarian operations. Thousands of people had already fled their homes to seek shelter from violence in camps for displaced people.	False

As Gregory and the other attorneys for the children wrote in their injunction request, "This injunction is urgently needed because, despite long-standing knowledge of the resulting destruction to our Nation and the profound harm to these young Plaintiffs, Defendants' ongoing development of the fossil fuel-based energy system is actively harming Plaintiffs and jeopardizing Plaintiffs' ability to obtain the full remedy in their case."	Besides suing the government, several counties and cities are seeking damages from coal, oil, and gas companies for contributing to climate change, which in turn is posing a public nuisance to these jurisdictions.	In so doing, the government has deprived the plaintiffs — the youngest is 11 years old — the right to a safe and stable climate system.

If the injunction is granted, it would lead to a nationwide moratorium on new fossil fuel permitting and leasing on federal lands and waters until the lawsuit is resolved. No small matter. However, existing mining and drilling projects would still proceed. The Juliana v. United States lawsuit, filed by 21 young plaintiffs, is currently going through pre-trial appeals at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The suit alleges that not only did the federal government fail to act to limit climate change, it profited off of selling coal, oil, and gas rights. The government encouraged mining and drilling while knowing full well the hazards caused by burning these fuels, namely climate change. In so doing, the government has deprived the plaintiffs — the youngest is 11 years old — the right to a safe and stable climate system. The lawsuit was first filed in 2015 but has proceeded in starts and stops. At one point, the Supreme Court stepped in to pause the case days before the trial before allowing it to go ahead. An appeals court has now stepped in to consider the government's motion to dismiss the case. Then on February 7, the plaintiffs filed their injunction against new fossil fuel extraction on government territory. Philip Gregory, one of the lead attorneys representing the children filing suit, explained that the injunction request is meant to address the urgency of limiting climate change by reducing emissions from fossil fuels immediately. With the case currently tied up in appeals, the plaintiffs wanted to make sure the current state of affairs with respect to climate change doesn't get worse as the wheels of justice slowly turn." e would have preferred to go to trial, submit our extensive evidence, and have the judge require the defendants to come up with a plan, a national climate recovery plan, for how they're going to go about doing this," Gregory said. As Gregory and the other attorneys for the children wrote in their injunction request, "This injunction is urgently needed because, despite long-standing knowledge of the resulting destruction to our Nation and the profound harm to these young Plaintiffs, Defendants' ongoing development of the fossil fuel-based energy system is actively harming Plaintiffs and jeopardizing Plaintiffs' ability to obtain the full remedy in their case." Numerous experts including retired Navy Vice Admiral Lee Gunn, economist Joseph Stiglitz, and climate scientist Eric Rignot have also filed amicus briefs supporting the injunction against new federal fossil fuel development. In response, the federal government argued this week that the injunction maneuver is a ploy to bypass proper legal proceedings. "Indeed, Plaintiffs by their present motion are essentially making a bid in this Court for a substitute mini-trial or 'trial lite' — which is premature until the pure issues of law now being briefed in this interlocutory appeal are appropriately resolved as a threshold matter," wrote attorneys for the US Department of Justice. They described the injunction request as an "ambitious attempt to throttle important government functions superintending broad swaths of the national economy." The government also noted that the Juliana lawsuit was filed more than three years ago but the plaintiffs hadn't asked to block fossil fuel leasing until now, which undermines the plaintiffs' argument that without immediate action, they would suffer irreparable harm. However, Gregory noted that the government didn't object to any of the evidence presented in the plaintiff's injunction request, nor did it present any new evidence for its request to deny the request. "Because there is no contrary evidence, then we are very optimistic that this injunction will go through," Gregory said. The Juliana v. United States is just one of more than a dozen climate change lawsuits underway in the US right now. Besides suing the government, several counties and cities are seeking damages from coal, oil, and gas companies for contributing to climate change, which in turn is posing a public nuisance to these jurisdictions. Legal experts say that these lawsuits are long shots and they're testing the limits of what existing jurisprudence covers. But if they succeed, they could set critical precedents, lead to billion-dollar payouts, and radically reshape the effort to limit global warming.	False

It's Official: Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Is An Ostrich About Wildfires At a conservative event in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, on Friday, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke pounced on the opportunity to blast his critics, including the "environmental terrorists" he blames for wildfires in the West. The left, he said, is "angry," "intolerant" and "uninformed" when it comes to public lands and environmental issues ― and they aren't interested in debate, one of the things that have "made America great." They don't want to be informed. They don't want to do the research," Zinke said. "They go to the same little trough of Kool-Aid every day. And they don't want to expand their paradigm and look at the actual facts." On Sunday, Zinke traveled to fire-ravaged California, where he made it abundantly clear that the Trump administration has no interest in the scientific research showing climate change is contributing to the extreme fires raging across the West or that the effect on wildfires is expected to grow as climate change drives up global temperatures and fuels droughts." 've heard the climate change argument back and forth. This has nothing to do with climate change," he told KCRA-TV in Sacramento. "This has to do with active forest management." It doesn't matter whether you believe or don't believe in climate change," he said during another interview this weekend while touring neighborhoods torched by the deadly Carr fire west of Redding, California. To be fair, Zinke acknowledged that "there's no doubt the [fire] season is getting longer, the temperatures are getting hotter," as The Sacramento Bee reported. But he didn't dwell on those factors and instead argued for more logging and thinning of forests while taking another swing at environmental groups that he says stand in the way of such efforts. It's true that the accumulation of fuel is among the factors that have contributed to increased fire activity, and California is taking additional steps to improve forest health. But a 2016 study found that human-caused climate change had doubled the amount of land that burned in Western forests over a 30-year period by significantly drying out vegetation. Thirteen of the state's 20 most-destructive fires on record have occurred since 2003. Coming in at No. 6 is the Carr fire, which has burned more than 200,000 acres, destroyed 1,599 structures and killed seven people, including three firefighters. Additionally, 15 of the state's 20 largest fires have occurred since 2002. The Mendocino Complex fire, which has burned nearly 300,000 acres north of Santa Rosa, surpassed last year's Thomas fire as the largest wildfire in California's history. California is already way ahead of where it was at this time last year, both in terms of the number of fires fought and the acreage burned. That a member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet would dismiss the link between climate change and wildfire is par for the course. What makes Zinke's statements during his trip to California so astonishing is that they come two days after he stressed the importance of being informed and open-minded. As HuffPost reported last week, the administration appears to be using the disaster in California as an opportunity to push partisan policy. While Zinke works the logging angle, Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have attempted to connect devastating California wildfires to a longstanding fight between farmers and environmentalists over water resources. The move came just two days after California fire officials dismissed Trump's claims that the fires have been exacerbated by a water shortage resulting from "bad environmental laws." As they see it, the problem is the one that Zinke and other administration officials refuse to acknowledge.	False

But environmental advocates warn it would be another damaging step by an administration obsessed with deregulation at the expense of hard-fought public health protections. The proposed loosening of air quality standards came in the form of a directive Trump issued Thursday instructing the EPA to work with states that have metro areas which failed to attain clean air standards. The president's primary aim, the directive states, is "promoting domestic manufacturing and job creation." Dozens of communities across the country fail to meet Clean Air Act standards for at least one of six key pollutants — ground-level ozone (smog), particulate matter (soot or smoke), carbon monoxide, lead, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide — according to the EPA. Building or expanding major projects, such as highways and manufacturing plants, in these "non-attainment" areas requires extra time and cost to make sure the increased industrial activity won't worsen air quality. And states with non-attainment areas have to file plans with the EPA to show how they're confronting the problem, a review process that can take years. Trump's directive orders the EPA to work with states to expedite those approvals and instructs the agency to consider whether the current process "should be revised or rescinded ... to provide states with additional implementation flexibility." These actions are intended to ensure that EPA carries out its core missions of protecting the environment and improving air quality in accord with statutory requirements, while reducing unnecessary impediments to new manufacturing and business expansion essential for a growing economy," the president said in a statement accompanying the order. Read More: Assailed as tool of industry, EPA administrator Pruitt affirms importance of scienceRead More: Exclusive: EPA's Pruitt vows to continue rolling back rules despite alarming climate reportRead More: Scott Pruitt on a mission to change the climate of the EPAThe directive comes at a time when the EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has been under increasing bipartisan fire on Capitol Hill for a number of management missteps, spending decisions and potential ethical conflicts. The president has staunchly defended Pruitt, largely because Trump and his conservative allies applaud how aggressively the EPA is rolling back regulations and promoting economic growth. In the 14 months he's been the nation's top environmental rulemaker, the former Oklahoma attorney general who sued the EPA more than a dozen times has rolled back the Clean Power Plan, rescinded the Waters of the U.S. rule, and helped convince the president to back out of the Paris Accord on climate change, among a number of changes. And Trump's vow to bring back coal, important in mining states like West Virginia where he just visited, have been buoyed by Pruitt's actions. The air quality directive doesn't instruct the EPA to revise the air quality standards themselves. Instead, environmental advocates worry the administration would try to circumvent clean air standards without congressional say-so by pursuing steps that could make it easier for industry to meet current regulations without being required to improve the quality of the air Americans beathe every day. One of those steps, they say, would allow states to expand the size of non-attainment areas to include areas with cleaner air so that overall pollutant levels meet environmental standards. Another would permit the EPA to discount many studies used as the basis for air quality standards for a lack of "transparency" because those analyses use individual health data that can't be disclosed because they're protected under federal privacy laws." This is a backhanded way of weakening the most important and sacrosanct provision of the clean Air Act and he's no doing it through any normal legislative process," said Bill Becker, former executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies which represents state regulators. Trump's action empowers Pruitt "to ignore science and data" in determining compliance with air quality standards, said Sara Jordan, Legislative Representative for the League of Conservation Voters." By directing the EPA to reconsider all of its past guidance from the (federal air quality) program, Trump is threatening clean air protections for cities across the country," she said. "This is yet another example of this administration selling out our future to industry polluters." Industry representatives say the maze of federal rules governing a slew of environmental and health standards are unnecessary and burdensome. If states had more wiggle room in how they measure and apply air quality standards, thousands of jobs could be created, they said." ver the years, regulations on air quality have become so complicated that it can be nearly impossible for manufacturers to secure the needed approvals just to open a new facility," said Ross Eisenberg, Vice President for Energy and Resources Policy with the National Association of Manufacturers. EPA officials point out that much progress has been made on air quality in recent decades.  Levels of Nitrogen Dioxide (NOx), for example, have dropped by more than 50 percent since 2000. There are no monitors in the U.S. currently measuring pollution above those standards. The order encourages federal and state regulators to speed up reviews of air quality permits, echoing Trump's call for quicker approvals involving infrastructure projects such as bridges, roads and pipelines. But Becker said that comes off as a hollow demand considering the president's budget calls for significant cuts in EPA personnel and state environmental grants that help pay for such reviews. One of the most troubling aspects of Trump's order is that it's directing an agency established to reduce pollution to make job creation an express priority, said John Walke, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's clean air program." The memo encourages reliance on air pollution modeling for deregulatory purposes or permits desired by industry, but not for regulatory purposes that would better protect Americans," he said.	False
138	vox	left_bias	2019-11-06	So climate change is likely to remain a key campaign issue for Democrats in the coming elections.	Many are already starting to feel the effects of the melting ice and warming oceans that result from rising average temperatures.	Rising waters are worsening the impacts of tropical storms that strike the state and will cost Virginia cities billions of dollars in losses in the coming decades.	But the test of these election promises will be in how they're implemented.	That's why Tuesday's results are a big deal for Virginia voters who want the state to do more to limit climate change.		Virginia Democrats campaigned on their Green New Deal and fighting climate change. And won. Virginia's efforts to fight climate change got a big boost after Tuesday's election, with Democrats flipping both chambers of the state's General Assembly. As part of its pre-election platform, Virginia's Democratic party unanimously endorsed two major progressive environmental resolutions: They voted in favor of setting a target of net-zero carbon emissions for the state by 2050 and they endorsed the Green New Deal Virginia. Like the Green New Deal resolution introduced in the US Congress, Virginia's version aims to move the state to 100 percent renewable energy while pursuing social welfare programs like job retraining for workers who would lose their jobs in the transition. Climate change isn't a far-off issue for Virginians, so it's not surprising that some were thinking about it at the ballot box. Many are already starting to feel the effects of the melting ice and warming oceans that result from rising average temperatures. The Hampton Roads region, for example, is facing the highest rate of sea-level rise on the East Coast. Rising waters are worsening the impacts of tropical storms that strike the state and will cost Virginia cities billions of dollars in losses in the coming decades. That's why Tuesday's results are a big deal for Virginia voters who want the state to do more to limit climate change. The new Democratic legislative majority could also allow Gov. Ralph Northam to fulfill his long-thwarted ambition of bringing Virginia into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a compact among nine East Coast states to cap and trade greenhouse gas emissions credits. Northam had failed to get the Republican-led legislature on board with his climate goals, but he signed an executive order in September mandating that Virginia generate 30 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2030 and generate all power from non-carbon-emitting sources by 2050. Joining RGGI would be a key way to finance this transition toward cleaner energy with revenue coming from auctioning off carbon credits. Virginia's Democratic Party also said that it would refuse contributions from energy providers like Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power that generate power from fossil fuels. It's part of a national campaign from environmental activists to push public officials to say no to money from the coal, oil, and natural gas industries. Yet in many key races, Democrats still out-raised their Republican opponents. But the test of these election promises will be in how they're implemented. Virginia gets 53 percent of its electricity from natural gas and 10 percent from coal, so it's a long uphill walk to zero emissions. Virginia is just the latest state where limiting climate change has proved to be a winning issueThe election results also show (yet again) that Democrats can campaign and win on aggressive action on climate change. And they illustrate that despite high-profile criticism from Republicans, the Green New Deal is proving to be popular with many voters, even in local elections. Ahead of the election, polls showed that more than 60 percent of Virginians wanted their government to do more about climate change. Young Virginia voters said climate change was a top-tier concern. Candidates like Joshua Cole, who won the election for Virginia's 28th House District, campaigned on environmental action, including upgrading infrastructure to make it more resilient and deploying clean energy. With Congress deadlocked and President Donald Trump pulling the United States out of the Paris climate agreement, Virginia's election also highlights how the biggest opportunities to curb greenhouse gases are occurring at the state level. States like Oregon, New Mexico, Colorado, and Nevada are already locking in more stringent limits on greenhouse gases and setting higher targets for deploying clean energy. And almost every Democrat running for the White House in 2020 wants to ramp up action on climate change should any of them take office. So climate change is likely to remain a key campaign issue for Democrats in the coming elections.	True

The new standard provided significant environmental and financial benefits if fully implemented. Under those rules, oil consumption would fall by 12 billion barrels, tailpipe emissions would halve and fuel efficiency would nearly double, saving consumers $3,200 to $5,700 in gasoline costs over a vehicle's lifetime. The regulation would have prevented 6 billion metric tons of planet-warming gases ― equivalent to a year's worth of pollution from 150 power plants ― from ever entering the atmosphere. In its 38-page finding, the EPA cited lower gas prices and changes to "consumer acceptance of advanced technology vehicles" as reasons the original determinations "no longer represent realistic assumptions." The agency also said it planned to reconsider how climate change factored in to regulation, noting that "the social cost of carbon" and "energy security valuation ... should also be updated to be consistent with the literature and empirical evidence." The memo made no mention of climate change. Automakers agreed to the rule in 2012 as part of the first major overhaul of fuel efficiency standards since the 1970s. But the policy set an April 2018 deadline to review the standards and tweak them if they proved too expensive or impossible to meet. In January 2017, the Obama administration attempted to lock the regulation in place by issuing a positive assessment of the costs and feasibility of the regulations. Despite overwhelmingly supporting the agreement seven years ago, carmakers began lobbying then-President-elect Donald Trump to reverse the Obama ruling almost immediately after the 2016 election. Automakers missed their emissions target for the first time last year, even though they achieved record fuel economy, in part because the companies boosted production of gas-guzzling SUVs. The decision to rewrite the rule puts the EPA at loggerheads with California regulators, who agreed in 2011 as part of the rule to align their tailpipe emissions standards with the national levels. The deal guaranteed consistent mileage and emissions rules nationwide, allowing automakers to save money by manufacturing vehicles to one standard. Undoing the rule threatens to upend that uniformity. Under the Clean Air Act, California is allowed to set vehicle emissions standards higher than the rest of the country, and with nearly 35.4 million registered vehicles, the state commands powerful influence over the American auto market. A dozen other states, including New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, have historically followed California's lead." ooperative federalism doesn't mean that one state can dictate standards for the rest of the country," Pruitt said. "It is in America's best interest to have a national standard, and we look forward to partnering with all states, including California, as we work to finalize that standard." The decision prompted sharp criticism from former EPA administrators. Carol Browner, who served as the agency's chief from 1993 to 2001, said Pruitt was wrong to cast California as wielding outsize influence over the regulations. She noted that the Golden State compromised on a number of rules, including a zero emissions vehicle program." his is all just another case of this administration wanting to make good on their political rhetoric and in this case not even wanting to make good for our own automakers," McCarthy, now the director of Harvard University's Center for Health and the Global Environment, told HuffPost." e support increasing clean car standards through 2025 and are not asking for a rollback," they wrote in a blog post on Medium. "We want one set of standards nationally, along with additional flexibility to help us provide more affordable options for our customers." The EPA never implemented the Clean Power Plan, the signature Obama-era rule to reduce emissions from the utility sector. But the law is still on the books, and the EPA has yet to propose a replacement that meets the legal requirements set by a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that found the agency is obliged to regulate any type of air pollution that "may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare," including greenhouse gases. The EPA and the Department of the Interior moved to eliminate Obama-era rules restricting methane emissions from gas drilling sites. But, last July, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled against the EPA's plan to suspend the rule. In February, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that the Interior Department's plan to delay methane regulations was "untethered to evidence."	True

There are shredded plastic bags, a glowstick from a rave on nearby Mykonos and even a food carton from Turkey." Look, you can see all the microplastics," she says, pointing at a mass of coloured dots bobbing on the waves. Like many islands in Greece's Cycladic region, waste production on the island of Paros explodes in summer when over 400,000 tourists join a local population of just 13,000. Paros is now at the centre of a drive to turn itself into the world's first island that is truly free of plastic waste. It looks like quite a challenge. In high season, the white-and-blue painted cafes that line the picturesque streets get through 1,000 plastic takeaway cups a day. Thousands of plastic bottles of water are shipped in daily, because many believe the tap water is undrinkable, although the water company insists that is wrong." You are really exposed to the reality of the situation when you live by the sea," says campaigner Zana Kontamanoli. The Greek waste management system suffered heavy cuts during the country's financial crisis, meaning recycling is often not separated and many landfill sites are not up to EU standards.A shocking 95% of waste in the Mediterranean is plastic. But within three years this may change. Paros residents Stella Cervello and Zana Kontamanoli are behind the Clean Blue Paros initiative that involves the local municipality as well as several NGOs."I was really shocked when I arrived. I could not believe how many plastic cups were flying around by the beach," says Ms Cervello, who began trying to make the island more sustainable when she moved here from France in 2016. And while she was starting up a Facebook group and talking to businesses about possible alternatives to plastic, Jo Royle from the charity Common Seas was trying to identify a Mediterranean island that could become a model for a future free of plastic waste." Islands provide a microcosm of a system that allows us to clearly see material flows," says Ms Royle. "We've got one port where everything comes in and goes off so we can really evaluate whether the systems we're piloting work." Paros was chosen because its changes in population give it complexity and because she found out when she visited the island that people were already working on the issue. Other islands such as the Seychelles archipelago have banned single-use plastics, but this is the first time an entirely new approach is being taken to make an island completely free of plastic waste. Huge signs now greet tourists at the airport to tell them about the Paros initiative. "It's what the island needs," says Ms Cervello. The team's first task was to convince as many local businesses as possible to drop "pointless plastics" such as straws and bottled water. "Out of 70 businesses we've spoken to, 50 have signed up," says Zana Kontamanoli. Fourteen businesses are piloting the separate collection of plastic cups and bottles which have a higher value recycle rate. The plastic will then be recycled on the mainland into something that can return to the island, such as benches." Research shows that when recycling is separated, people are less likely to just chuck all their waste in and contaminate it," says Kontamanoli. However, there are still many obstacles facing the team. Most bins on the island do not close, so the strong Aegean winds blow waste into the sea. And while many residents are enthusiastic about the project, there are still some that need convincing." Not serving bottled water has harmed us," admits Andy Kirk, owner of Nemobar, the first business to sign up to the scheme. "Even when we explain we have a water filter, many customers don't like it. But we've stuck to our guns." Another sticking point has been convincing bakeries and pharmacies to stop using plastic bags. The team has managed to collect thousands of used hotel bed sheets, which would usually be sent to landfill, and are making them into tote bags." In our audit we found that on some parts of the island 60% of waste was recyclable, so there needs to be more education," says Kontamanoli. The team is focusing its education efforts on the island's 2,500 schoolchildren. Most drink one small bottle of water a day each, so they are being given refillable bottles while water filters are being installed at schools. "Children are powerful drivers of change because they go home and talk to their parents about it," says Zana Kontamanoli. Although they are only six months in, the team are optimistic that big changes can be made as soon as the tourist season is over and residents have more time on their hands to overhaul how they do things." Plastic pollution is very complex and there's not one solution," says Jo Royle. "But we hope if these systems work they can be applied elsewhere too."	True

Voters aged 18-29 ranked green jobs as their No. 4 priority, and voters of color in that age range ranked it No. 3. In a Gallup poll last month, just 1 percent of Americans ― including Republicans and independents as well as Democrats ― chose "environment/pollution" as the country's most important problem from a list of dozens of issues. In a separate May 2017 Gallup survey, just 2 percent of Americans listed "create more 'green' jobs" as the best policy to increase employment in the United States, compared to 19 percent who listed "keep manufacturing jobs here/Stop sending overseas." The findings come as the Trump administration is on the cusp of fully rolling back two of the most critical federal rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Next year, the White House is planning a make a new push to build more oil and gas pipelines, Larry Kudlow, the president's top economic adviser, said at an event this month. Already, at least six of the Democratic senators expected to run for president in 2020 are backing legislation to guarantee a job to every American worker who wants one. It's an idea roughly 46 percent of Americans support, according to an April survey by Rasmussen Reports. Polling Data for Progress released in September pegged the number slightly higher, at 55 percent of eligible U.S. voters, but found that those opposed decreased from 23 percent to 18 percent when the guaranteed jobs are green. Even among Trump voters, the September survey found, support for guaranteed jobs is stronger when the jobs are green, with 35 percent in support and 36 percent opposed. Without an environmental focus, Trump voters in support of guaranteed jobs dropped to 30 percent, with 45 percent opposed. Even in deep-red counties in fossil fuel-producing states, support for requiring utilities to produce 20 percent of electricity from renewables averages well above 50 percent, according to 2018 survey data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. Support for providing tax rebates for energy-efficient vehicles and solar panels soars well above 75 percent in most of those same counties. Adopting a green jobs plan could also help Democrats ease the tension between the party's labor and climate hawks. In August, the Democratic National Committee backtracked on a two-month-old ban on fossil fuel donations. The move was a cave to unions that overwhelmingly support pipeline projects that pay much better than renewable energy jobs, which tend not to use organized labor. Still, the policy seems far off at best. It's difficult to imagine such a bill passing a Republican-dominated Congress, much less gaining Trump's signature. Democratic leadership has indicated it has no plans to push a major climate bill even if the party takes the House of Representatives in next month's election. Yet there's a small contingent of left-wing candidates ― including Wisconsin congressional candidate Randy Bryce and Kevin de León, the California lawmaker challenging Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein ― who are running on a so-called "Green New Deal," a reference to the Great Depression-era spending programs that established many of the nation's infrastructure landmarks. Ocasio-Cortez, the democratic socialist expected to become the next U.S. representative for New York's 14th Congressional District, likened climate change to the "existential threat" posed by "Nazi Germany and the Axis." The last time we had a really major existential threat to this country was around World War II," Ocasio-Cortez said at a campaign event. "And so we've been here before and we have a blueprint of doing this before." Climate scientists tend to agree. In July, Penn State University climatologist Michael Mann called Ocasio-Cortez's proposal for trillions in federal spending on a Green New Deal to be "just the sort of audacious and bold thinking we will need if we are going to avert a climate crisis." Just three weeks ago, a sobering United Nations report warned that world governments have just 12 years to halve emissions in order to avert cataclysmic climate change. And even then, the researchers found that technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere will be required to keep warming within 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit, beyond which scientists say many densely populated places will become uninhabitable. Progress to mitigate climate change has been alarmingly limited. Despite the rapid construction of renewable energy infrastructure, the United States, the world's largest per-capita emitter, is aggressively bolstering its fossil fuel production. Last year, Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, which every recognized country on Earth has signed. Brazil, the vast rainforests of which are critical to absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, is poised to elect a president who vowed to ramp up deforestation and withdraw from the historic 2015 accord as well. China, the world's top national emitter, is continuing to build new coal plants despite pledging to cancel the facilities.	True

The Trump administration is proposing to slash funding for the Leaking Underground Storage Tank program by nearly half next year — from nearly $92 million this year to about $47 million in 2018. The recommended cut in the LUST program is part of the president's proposal to reduce the Environmental Protection Agency budget by 31% next year. Funding for LUST is a drop in the EPA's $8.2 billion budget. But state officials, environmental activists and public health advocates warn that the size of the cut carries great risk considering groundwater is the source of drinking water for nearly half of all Americans. They say such a reduction would hamper monitoring, prevention, enforcement and cleanup of leaks as well as the important role EPA plays in providing technical assistance to state regulators and businesses, many of them gas stations, who have aging tanks and piping under their sites. In a letter earlier this year to congressional leaders, the head of the trade organization representing state solid waste agencies said the cut would impede the long-term progress states have made on inspection and cleanup. The program "has made great strides in increasing the number of compliant tanks in the last 25 years, which has resulted in fewer releases," wrote Dania Rodriguez, executive director of the Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials. "Loss of program funding would reverse this trend." The Trump administration announced the proposed cut in May, two months after the Department of Veterans Affairs officially recognized the harm contaminated water — some of it linked to underground fuel tanks — inflicted on hundreds of thousands of marines stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina from 1953 through 1987. Under the VA program announced in March, those who served at least 30 days in Lejeune during that period are eligible for treatment of eight diseases, including several cancers and Parkinson's Disease. There are 558,451 active tanks located in about 201,000 sites nationwide, according to the EPA's most recent tally. Most are service stations, but they also include any operation where fuel is stored underground such as government fleet garages, large retail operations like Costco stores that sell gas, and institutions like hospitals or universities that store fuel to power emergency generators." cross the country, thousands of underground storage tanks and accompanying pipes — many of them made from older, corroding steel — hold and carry a variety of fuels and chemicals," the Environmental Defense Fund wrote in a recent report. "When tanks leak harmful chemicals such as oil, gas, benzene and toluene into soil and ground water, drinking water and soil are fouled, community health is jeopardized, and economic development is crippled." The number of tanks with confirmed releases hit a high in 1995 with nearly 172,000. But the backlog of sites needing to be cleaned up has been declining since 2000, according to EPA records. As of March 31, EPA reported 70,094 tanks with confirmed leaks. Some of these are not actively leaking, but have residual contamination that needs to be cleaned up. Superfund cuts would lead to delays in toxic cleanups, experts warnFlorida leads the list of states reporting the most leaking tanks with 10,421, followed by Michigan (8,000), Illinois (5,733), New Jersey (5,100) and North Carolina (4,006). Site owners are ultimately liable for cleanup costs, but a taxpayer-funded trust fund is in place when sites must be addressed quickly, are abandoned or when owners don't have the resources. The fund is financed by a 0.1 cent per gallon tax on gasoline,  which generated $202 million in 2016. Administration officials did not offer much explanation for the cut, one of dozens proposed in the EPA budget." istorically the (underground tank) program has worked closely with our state, territorial, and tribal partners," an agency spokeswoman wrote in an email. "We know they are on the front lines to protect our land and groundwater from petroleum leaks, such as those from gas stations and other (underground storage tank) facilities, and we expect this partnership will continue to be a hallmark of the program." She wrote it would be "premature for us to speculate" about EPA's budget given that Congress has yet to finalize the agency's funding for next year. The House Appropriations Committee voted in July to restore almost all of the funding for the program, but neither the full House nor the Senate has acted yet. The cost of cleaning up a site depends on a variety of factors, including the extent of contamination and state cleanup standards. The average cleanup is estimated to cost $130,000 but can rise to over $1 million if groundwater is infected. Ben Thomas, a former tank inspector and state regulator in Alaska who now consults with private operators on meeting the inspection rules, said cutting the program would hurt businesses that have come to "appreciate the heavy stick of enforcement for bad players (and) the general community outreach." Slashing a program known for the collaboration between regulators and businesses and the effectiveness it's achieved in reducing the backlog of leaking tanks would be crippling, he said." t some point, such a deep cut makes any agency effectively non-responsive," Thomas said. "There's simply not enough money to know what to prioritize. Stuff that makes a big stink like enforcement would probably get cut (as would) the ability for states to maintain a hotline, maintain a web page or do workshops. I could easily imagine all that stuff would be kind of viewed as frivolous and go away because it's not core statement message stuff."	False

It found eight of the atolls and almost three-quarters of the islands grew during the study period, lifting Tuvalu's total land area by 2.9 percent, even though sea levels in the country rose at twice the global average.  Co-author Paul Kench said the research, published Friday in the journal Nature Communications, challenged the assumption that low-lying island nations would be swamped as the sea rose. "We tend to think of Pacific atolls as static landforms that will simply be inundated as sea levels rise, but there is growing evidence these islands are geologically dynamic and are constantly changing," he said. "The study findings may seem counter-intuitive, given that (the) sea level has been rising in the region over the past half century, but the dominant mode of change over that time on Tuvalu has been expansion, not erosion." If only they'd done their study a bit earlier they could have saved a lot of alarmists a lot of worry. As recently as last year, anxious wonks produced a paper for the World Bank arguing that the situation in Tuvalu (pop. 11,000) and nearby Kiribati (pop.107,000) was so dire that Australia and New Zealand should open their doors to the fleeing refugees. According to the paper:In 2007, Grist went so far as to cite Tuvalu of one of climate change's most "tragic" victims.'Climate Change in Tuvalu' even has its own Wikipedia page. It records possibly Tuvalu's greatest moment of glory on the international stage when it seized the opportunity at the 2009 Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen to grandstand about its terrible plight. In December 2009 the islands stalled talks at United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, fearing some other developing countries were not committing fully to binding deals on a reduction in carbon emission, their chief negotiator stated "Tuvalu is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change, and our future rests on the outcome of this meeting."[57] When the conference failed to reach a binding, meaningful agreement, Tuvalu's representative Ian Fry said, "It looks like we are being offered 30 pieces of silver to betray our people and our future… Our future is not for sale.

The five-minute speech addressed the dangers of rising sea levels to Tuvalu and the world. In his speech Fry claimed man-made global warming to be currently "the greatest threat to humanity", and ended with an emotional "the fate of my country rests in your hands".[59]Tuvalu's plight also formed part of the basis for arguably the most hysterical fake news claim in the history of climate alarmism: the UN's prediction that by the end of 2010, climate change would have created "50 million environmental refugees". The UN has since removed the claim from most of its websites. Happily, it can still be glimpsed in the Guardian archives:Rising sea levels, desertification and shrinking freshwater supplies will create up to 50 million environmental refugees by the end of the decade, experts warn today. Janos Bogardi, director of the Institute for Environment and Human Security at the United Nations University in Bonn, said creeping environmental deterioration already displaced up to 10 million people a year, and the situation would get worse. "There are well-founded fears that the number of people fleeing untenable environmental conditions may grow exponentially as the world experiences the effects of climate change," Dr Bogardi said. "This new category of refugee needs to find a place in international agreements. We need to better anticipate support requirements, similar to those of people fleeing other unviable situations." In reality, the total number of environmental refugees fleeing climate change so far around the world is close to zero. But that hasn't stopped a few chancers from trying it on…Seventeen people from the Pacific – including 11 from Tuvalu and five from Kiribati – have already made refugee claims in New Zealand, citing climate change as part of their basis of claim. None have been successful (four have yet to be determined and 13 have been rejected) because the refugees convention does not recognise climate change as grounds for protection. To climate skeptics, the fact that Tuvalu is not drowning will come as no surprise whatsoever. Their favorite sea levels expert – Nils-Axel Mörner – has written numerous papers on the subject.	False

The former Vice President was clearly floundering during CNN's climate change town hall on Wednesday, which saw him face off against eight other Democrats. Viewers called him out for "rambling, incoherent" answers and held his feet to the fire regarding his coziness with the fossil fuel industry. Then his left eye began filling up with blood.

But he had, along with most of the other Democratic candidates, promised not to take money from the fossil fuel industry – a promise the fundraiser seemed to break, to viewers' dismay. But even the most blatant political hypocrisy was no match for the eye. "Look, Biden haters, sometimes your eye is gonna spontaneously fill up with blood, okay," one user joked. "Twitter furiously deploying algorithms to keep Biden's bloody corpse eye from trending," observed another (it appeared to work - while #ClimateTownHall was trending, #BidensBloodyEye and variations thereof were noticeably not).

Last month, another federal judge dismissed similar global warming claims against oil firms brought by San Francisco and Oakland. More than a dozen climate lawsuits filed during the last year by cities and counties seek billions of dollars in damages from oil and gas companies. But it appears that all of these lawsuits will eventually be thrown out. New York City sought monetary damages from BP, Chevron, Conoco-Phillips, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell as compensation for damage caused by dangerous global warming allegedly caused by the companies. But John F. Keenan, District Court judge for the Southern District of New York, disagreed and dismissed the complaint. Judge Keenan ruled that, "…it would thus be illogical to allow the City to bring state law claims when courts have found that these matters are areas of federal concern that have been delegated to the Executive Branch as they require a uniform, national solution…Global warming and solutions thereto must be addressed by the other two branches of government." On June 25 on the west coast, US District Judge William Alsup threw out similar suits brought by the California cities of Oakland and San Francisco. Judge Alsup stated, "…it is true that carbon dioxide released from fossil fuels has caused (and will continue to cause) global warming. But against that negative, we must weigh this positive: Our industrial revolution and the development of our modern world have literally been fueled by oil and coal. Without those fuels, virtually all of our monumental progress would have been impossible." Judge Alsup concluded that the courts should "defer to the legislative and executive branches." Note that Judge Alsup is not a conservative judge. Alsup was nominated by President Bill Clinton in 1999. In January, he blocked Trump Administration efforts to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Several other climate lawsuits are pending in California. In July of last year, San Mateo County, Marin County, and Imperial Beach filed separate suits against 37 oil and gas companies in California Superior Court. Last December, Santa Cruz and Santa Cruz County also brought suits in California Superior Court against 29 companies. In January, the City of Richmond, California and the County of Contra Costa also filed claims against 29 companies. Other state entities also initiated legal action this year. In April, the city of Boulder, Boulder County and San Miguel County filed a suit in Colorado against Exxon and Suncor. In May, King County Washington, the home of Seattle, filed suit against five companies. Just this month, the state of Rhode Island and the City of Baltimore filed separate climate change suits against oil and gas companies. But all of these suits are likely to be thrown out. The New York City and the Oakland/San Francisco suits, the lawsuits with the highest profile, have now been dismissed. As Judge Alsup noted in his opinion, "No plaintiff has ever succeeded in bringing a nuisance claim based on global warming." All district or appellate courts are likely to eventually rule that climate change issues are to be decided by the federal government, not state and local governments. It's clear that climate lawsuits do not reflect the will of congressional representatives elected by the American people. In December of 1998, President Bill Clinton signed the Kyoto Protocol, a 1997 international treaty signed by 192 nations committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But the US Senate passed a resolution of disapproval with a vote of 95-0, so the treaty was never submitted to the Senate for ratification. Cap and trade legislation was rejected by Congress in 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009. Last week the US House of Representatives passed a resolution opposing a carbon tax. While advocates of climate common sense are pleased with the recent court decisions, the acceptance that humans are causing dangerous climate change by the oil and gas defendants is very disappointing. Evidence shows that natural factors, not emissions from industry, dominate global temperatures. Nor are the feared climate disasters happening. Evidence shows that storms, droughts, or floods are neither more frequent nor more severe than in past decades. Oceans are rising 7-8 inches per century, not the 20 feet per century predicted by former Vice President Al Gore and others. And the polar bears are doing just fine.A simple example is the question of snow extent. The Boulder, Colorado lawsuit alleges that warming caused by oil companies is "reducing the snowpack" in Colorado mountains. While some areas have received less snow, satellite data from the Rutgers University Global Snow lab shows that both North American and Northern Hemisphere snow extent has been increasing for the last 40 years. Like most efforts to "fight climate change," climate lawsuits are a massive waste of taxpayer money. Cities, counties, and states are spending millions of dollars on futile public nuisance lawsuits that are doomed to failure.

Donald Trump mocks teen global warming hero Greta Thunberg Global warming activist Greta Thunberg has trolled President Trump after he told the teen to 'chill' and 'work on her anger management problems'. The 16-year-old, who was named Time magazine's 'Person of The Year', updated her Twitter bio on Thursday to read: 'A teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend.'Her bio was a verbatim echo of Trump's tweet about her earlier in the day, in which he reacted to news that the publication had awarded the accolade to Thunberg instead of him.'So ridiculous,' the Commander-in-chief wrote. 'Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!'Thousands of Twitter users rushed to applaud Thunberg after she changed her bio to mock the President. Many praised the teenager for outmaneuvering Trump on Twitter - who is widely seen as one of the platform's most skillful and effective users. By lunchtime the hashtag #GretaOutdidTrump was trending on the social media platform, with one popular response reading: 'A 16-year old with Asperger's and non-native English speaker has better social and communications skills than the current President of the United States. And better Twitter game.'Another wrote: 'Interesting how a leader that acts like a child is yelling at a child who acts like a leader'. It's not the first time Thunberg has used her Twitter bio to deftly turn Trump's attacks back around. In September, Greta described herself as a 'very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future' after the President sarcastically said of her UN Speech: 'She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see.'Meanwhile, the President insists he wasn't petty about losing out as Time magazine's person of the year. When asked Wednesday if the White House had a comment about the Commander-in-chief losing the honor to Thunberg, White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley emailed DailyMail. com: 'Huh?!?'Thunberg is the magazine's youngest-ever Person of the Year, a title that still sparks Internet curiosity one day each year despite the steep decline of magazine sales. The teen girl with Asperger's syndrome is the face of the youth climate movement, drawing large crowds with her appearances at protests and conferences since last year. Her angry accusations that world leaders are failing the younger generation have made headlines, including her shouts of 'How dare you?' during the UN General Assembly this year. An image of her staring at Donald Trump as he entered the UN quickly became a social media meme. Trump has said he doesn't believe global warming is mainly caused by humans. During the 2016 campaign he claimed it was a 'hoax' promoted by China in order to gain economic advantage over the United States. The president has since withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris Climate Treaty. Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal told the Today show: 'She became the biggest voice on the biggest issue facing the planet this year, coming from essentially nowhere to lead a worldwide movement.'Politicians have mostly praised Thunberg and her movement as an important voice of her generation. Former Vice President Al Gore said Wednesday: 'Brilliant decision for @TIME to choose @GretaThunberg as its Person of the Year.'Greta embodies the moral authority of the youth activist movement demanding that we act immediately to solve the climate crisis. She is an inspiration to me and to people across the world,' Gore said. Felsenthal said Thunberg 'represents a broader generational shift in the culture,' adding: 'She embodies youth activism.'The magazine says: 'In the 16 months since, she has addressed heads of state at the U.N., met with the Pope, sparred with the President of the United States and inspired 4 million people to join the global climate strike on September 20, 2019, in what was the largest climate demonstration in human history.''For sounding the alarm about humanity's predatory relationship with the only home we have, for bringing to a fragmented world a voice that transcends backgrounds and borders, for showing us all what it might look like when a new generation leads, Greta Thunberg is TIME's 2019 Person of the Year,' the media franchise said Wednesday on its website.

Global warming fail: Study finds melting sea ice is actually helping Arctic animals Proponents of the theory humans are primarily responsible for rising global temperatures long claimed wildlife are harmed significantly by global warming, and that unless mankind stops producing significant amounts of carbon-dioxide emissions, the world's animals will not be able to thrive. While rising temperatures have certainly put a strain on species in some parts of the world, a new study by researchers at the University of Southern Denmark suggests animals in the Arctic region are thriving as because of higher global temperatures. According to a press release touting the study's new findings, warmer conditions have produced a larger number of life-sustaining "melt ponds" in Arctic waters." elt ponds provide more light and heat for the ice and the underlying water, but now it turns out that they may also have a more direct and potentially important influence on life in the Arctic waters," stated the press release." ats of algae and bacteria can evolve in the melt ponds, which can provide food for marine creatures. This is the conclusion of researchers in the periodical, Polar Biology," the press release said. The researchers said nutrients are able to reach sea creatures in the Arctic more easily because of the melt ponds." limate change is accompanies by more storms and more precipitation, and we must expect that more nutrients will be released from the surroundings into the melt ponds," said Professor Ronnie Glud of the Department of Biology at SDU. "These conditions, plus the fact that the distribution of areas of melt ponds is increasing, can contribute to increased productivity in plant and animal life in the Arctic seas." Recent data released by scientists at NASA and the National Snow and Ice Data Center reveals sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic regions are at their lowest recorded point since 1979, when satellite data first started estimating sea ice. About 2 million square km of Arctic sea ice are estimated to have been lost since 1979. Current data suggest about 14.28 million square km of sea ice remain. USA Today recently declared the loss of sea ice "terrifying," but global warming skeptics have long suggested these claims are overblown when put into perspective. As reported by Anthony Watts on his influential climate-change website Watts Up With That, the president of the Royal Society in London reported in 1817 significant reductions to arctic sea ice." t will without doubt have come to your Lordship's knowledge that a considerable change of climate, inexplicable at present to us, must have taken place in the Circumpolar Regions, by which the severity of the cold that has for centuries past enclosed the seas in the high northern latitudes in an impenetrable barrier of ice has been during the last two years, greatly abated. … this affords ample proof that new sources of warmth have been opened and give us leave to hope that the Arctic Seas may at this time be more accessible than they have been for centuries past, and that discoveries may now be made in them not only interesting to the advancement of science but also to the future intercourse of mankind and the commerce of distant nations."

Senator Jeff Merkley Shreds Trump's EPA Appointee Over Global Warming Beliefs After this hurricane season, the GOP has a dose of reality they are going to HAVE to take – climate change is real, and it can and will be destructive. With what basically amounts to a humanitarian crisis going on in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, it cannot be ignored any longer. However, with a Trump administration, it will be if allowed. Fortunately for the country and the world, there are some Democrats who will do their best to stop the Republican party from destroying the Earth with their own blatant ignorance. During a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing on Wednesday, Senator Jeff Merkley (D-OR) took EPA appointee William Wehrum to task over his inability to acknowledge that greenhouse gases do have a major impact on temperature. Merkley displayed a chart, composed by NASA, that showed the relationship between rising temperatures and rising greenhouse emissions. Obviously, the chart showed that as greenhouse gas emissions go up so does the temperature. It was a basic question asking if the lines followed each other. A five-year-old could easily note that they do indeed follow each other. Wehrum tried to sleazily worm his way out of answering the simple question. Merkley interrupted Wehrum and asked him to just look at the lines. Wehrum never did answer the question. Merkley thanked him and then let him have it. He then noted NASA found no correlation between solar activity or volcanic activity; however, they did find a correlation between carbon dioxide and other global warming gases and the rising temperature of the planet. Merkley continued:For the rest of the questioning, Merkley continued to show just how woefully ignorant the officials in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency are. The truly maddening part though is that Merkley showed the American people that it's not just ignorance – it's intentional ignorance.

Plastic Bags, or Paper? Here's What to Consider When You Hit the Grocery Store So does that mean paper bags, which degrade more easily, are a better option? Not necessarily. Climate change has become the biggest environmental issue of our time, so it's worth looking at things from an emissions standpoint. And on that score, paper bags fare worse. Even though paper bags are made from trees, which are, in theory, a renewable resource, it takes significantly more energy to create pulp and manufacture a paper bag than it does to make a single-use plastic bag from oil. Back in 2011, Britain's Environment Agency conducted a life-cycle assessment of various bag options, looking at every step of the production process. The conclusion? You'd have to reuse a paper bag at least three times before its environmental impact equaled that of a high-density polyethylene plastic bag used only once. And if plastic bags were reused repeatedly, they looked even better. Paper bags can more easily be recycled or even composted, bu t the British study found that even these actions didn't make a huge difference in the broader analysis. Unless you're reusing your paper bags a lot, they look like a poorer option from a global warming standpoint. That same British analysis also looked into reusable options, like heavier, more durable plastic bags or cotton bags. And it found that these are only sustainable options if you use them very frequently. Making a cotton shopping bag is hardly cost-free. Growing cotton requires a fair bit of energy, land, fertilizer and pesticides, which can have all sorts of environmental effects — from greenhouse gas emissions to nitrogen pollution in waterways.

Europe's growing 'climate civil disobedience' movement... Thousands of European activists plan to blockade a large German lignite mine this week, the latest protest of a growing "climate civil disobedience" movement. While school students have held "Fridays for Future" rallies for months, protesters of the "Extinction Rebellion" group launched in Britain have risked arrest with more confrontational protests. From next Thursday to Monday, Europe's veteran "Ende Gelaende" (EG) anti-coal activists will hold their sixth large-scale blockade of an open-pit coal mine and power plants run by German energy giant RWE. The group's online "action consensus" says: "In view of the urgency of the climate crisis, we consider it necessary and appropriate to go one step further: from public protest to civil disobedience." Here is a look at this growing form of environmental activism. Tadzio Mueller, a German organiser of the movement, argues that "massively breaking the rules ... is the only thing that works to prevent the status quo in the face of climate chaos". Azna Lecuyer of the French branch of Ende Gelaende agrees that "we feel a passion for actions of civil disobedience, especially among young people." This is reflected in demand for training courses everywhere and by the very rapid rise in skills of new activists." Lecuyer stresses that "non-violence is part of our action consensus: it is forbidden to harm the security forces, site employees or to damage the equipment". During past protests at the nearby Hambacher Forest, police and RWE company staff have accused the most militant protesters of having hurled rocks or molotov cocktails. The Ende Gelaende movement has distanced itself from those environmental militants and any acts of violence. The EG activists—dressed in trademark white overalls symbolising the toxicity of fossil fuels—plan to march from their protest camp to the Garzweiler mine about 10 kilometres (six miles) away. They hope to evade police roadblocks and enter the vast open-pit mining area to occupy strategic locations and "technical infrastructure such as rails, access roads and excavators". Meanwhile they plan to organise in so-called affinity groups of up to 10 people of similar physical fitness—and a willingness to be arrested for trespassing and other offences. Before the protest, activists attend training workshops to learn non-violent resistance techniques such as locking their arms and legs in formation with names such as "the little train" or "the turtle". What risks do protesters take?Occupying an industrial site is illegal under German law, and volunteer legal advisers are on hand to support activists before and after they are arrested. They advise them to say as little as possible while in custody. Other risks lurk at the Garzweiler site. A vast moonscape-like terrain where the surface can be unstable after rain or drought, it is criss-crossed by high-power cables and dug up by building-sized excavators. When breaking up protesters' blockades, German police have in the past employed high-powered water jets and pepper spray. Lecuyer says that some activists experience a form of "trauma ... due to the high emotions from stress and excitement and the physical effort, because you have to walk for miles in groups to the target, pass police roadblocks, sometimes under water cannon or pepper spray, and then hold the blockade".

722	The Huffington Post	left_bias	2017-09-18	Let's begin with "bringing back coal."	Closing vulnerable plants, facilities that no longer make economic sense to keep operating, could avoid another 275 million tons.	As the CEO of one of America's historically coal dependent utilities, Tom Fanning of the Southern Company, says, "You can't keep waves off the beach."	)The 15 "early adaptor" states in the Climate Alliance will report this week that they are already on track to reduce their 2025 emissions by 24-29 percent.	It is true, the Trump administration is struggling to hold back the future, with appalling decisions like EPA's recent announcement that it would delay cleaning up toxic water pollution from coal power plants for two years.		America Is Doubling Down On Climate Progress The American political conversation about climate is, indeed, scary and depressing. But the decarbonization of the real U.S. economy – as opposed to the cardboard, fossil fuel-handicapped White House version – continues. Indeed, decarbonization is accelerating, giving me confidence that in a year or so, it will be clear to everyone that the U.S. is on track to meet and perhaps exceed its (inadequate) 2025 Paris objective, cutting emissions 26-28 percent. That goal requires reducing emissions by 1,800 million tons of CO2. At the end of 2016, the U.S. was almost halfway – emissions down 850 million tons, or 13 percent. This progress was led by the utility sector, where efficiency, renewables and natural were replacing coal so fast that power sector carbon was down 25 percent. The world rightfully worries when they hear Donald Trump proclaim he is going to bring back coal and watch the administration and the Republican Congress try to roll back such common sense requirements  limits on the wasteful flaring and leaking of methane from oil and gas fields. But Trump's promise to have America withdraw from the Paris climate agreement has sparked a stunning wave of climate leadership from U.S. cities, states and businesses, a wave that is still building, but by the time it crests may more than make up for Trump's stubborn foot-dragging. Let's begin with "bringing back coal." Since Trump was elected, no new coal plants have been announced or opened; 10 plants with 5,600 megawatts instead have announced they will shut down. West Virginia's largest utility won't expand coal generation because it can't find customers for coal power; CSX, a leading coal hauling railroad, thinks coal is going away so fast that it has stopped replacing coal rail cars. Now, the Sierra Club has estimated that additional coal plants whose retirement have already been announced would cut emissions about 160 million tons. Closing vulnerable plants, facilities that no longer make economic sense to keep operating, could avoid another 275 million tons. If present trends continue, the club also documented that the U.S. could triple renewable electricity; overall, the utility sector should be emitting 500 million tons of carbon less in 2025 than it was just last year. While coal fades, state governments representing almost 60 percent of the American economy are racing forward. In January, California released its plan to cut its emissions by 40 percent by 2030 and went on to extend its cap and trade program for another decade, until 2030 – this time with support for the first time from the oil industry! California is also on the verge of requiring 100 percent of its power to come from renewables. Overall, a dozen states are debating increasing their reliance on renewable power. Maryland just established a 25 percent renewable power goal, overriding the veto of a Republican governor. (The Nevada legislature went for 40 percent but has not yet been able to overturn a similar veto.)The 15 "early adaptor" states in the Climate Alliance will report this week that they are already on track to reduce their 2025 emissions by 24-29 percent. And some of America's most Republican, climate-skeptical states – Oklahoma, Kansas, North Dakota and even Texas, are steadily replacing coal with renewables – for economic reasons. These don't usually get counted in reporting on bottom up climate action – but they have a huge positive impact on emissions. Whether their state legislatures and governors are leading on climate or not, America's cities, where most of our climate pollution originates, are embracing a decarbonized future. In June, when Trump promised to pull out of the Paris agreement, 125 cities told the world "we are still in" the Paris agreement. Today, only three months later, the number has ballooned to 238. The U.S. Conference of Mayors, representing more than 1,000 of America's largest cities, voted unanimously to endorse the goal of 100 percent renewable power – and since Trump's election, the number of U.S. cities with 100 percent policies has mushroomed – more than 40 cities are now committed individually, and five have hit that target!But government is not alone. The private sector, where companies are increasingly competing with each other to succeed in the carbon-free economy of the future, is  making Trump's climate-denial braggadocio increasingly irrelevant. The Mars Candy Company recently committed a billion dollars to ensure that it's operations and supply chain would reduce their climate impact by 67 percent by 2050. The number of companies who have signed the pledge of support for the Paris agreement has almost doubled, from 906 in June to 1,729 this week.  And global firms will impact the U.S. climate footprint. VW announced a few days ago that it will offer electric versions of all its models – entering the competition against current global EV leader, U.S.-based Tesla, which delivered its first Model 3 in July. It is true, the Trump administration is struggling to hold back the future, with appalling decisions like EPA's recent announcement that it would delay cleaning up toxic water pollution from coal power plants for two years. But the courts are steadily shredding much of this; the conservative 10th circuit just ruled that Trump must consider climate impacts before issuing new coal leases on federal lands. As the CEO of one of America's historically coal dependent utilities, Tom Fanning of the Southern Company, says, "You can't keep waves off the beach." King Canute knew this. And the decarbonization of the American economy – the real economy, not the fake news economy – shows it's still true. The world can see and measure – America is still in.	True

Trump and others who deny climate change have cited cold temperatures and winter storms to dismiss global warming, but experts have noted there is a difference between the climate and weather.A government report issued late last year concluded that climate change could cost the United States billions of dollars annually within decades if greenhouse gases aren't dramatically reduced and could worsen environmental disasters like wildfires and flooding. Its findings aligned with those of the broader scientific community. The study, mandated to be released every four years under the National Climate Assessment from the multiagency Global Change Research Program, was conducted by hundreds of government and external scientists. Trump dismissed the report, saying he did not believe its findings and disputing that climate change is man-made.	False

Miller suggested that the Endangered Species Act would be the first environmental issue to take the stage on a Kennedy-less court: A dispute over the endangered dusky gopher frog, Weyerhaeuser v. US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), is now on the court's docket in the fall.		Retiring Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy Was A "Gettable Vote" On Environmental Cases, Lawyers Say Mark Miller of Pacific Legal Foundation, an anti-regulation law group that has won 10 out of 12 Supreme Court cases it has pursued, told BuzzFeed News it is too soon to tell exactly how a replacement for Kennedy would change environmental law. "You couldn't predict how Justice Kennedy was going to decide things over his thirty-some years." Reliably hard to predict, Kennedy was more interested in nuanced and scientific arguments than some of the more conservative judges with a stricter anti-regulation outlook, David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council told BuzzFeed News. "Clearly, over the years he has been in a different spot from the other judges." Trump has said he will choose Kennedy's replacement from a short list of 25 candidates . If that holds true, the new court will likely be harder to convince of the importance of environmental laws. "He was a gettable fifth vote on decisions," Bookbinder said. "Things are more daunting without him." He will be missed," David Bookbinder of the Niskanen Center, who was the Sierra Club's chief climate counsel in the 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA decision that designated greenhouse gasses as pollution under the Clean Air Act. But during his 30-year tenure, Kennedy was also the key vote on fundamental environmental decisions. Environmental lawyers are worried about tough times ahead for new laws restricting pollution and protecting wildlife. Kennedy announced his retirement Wednesday, prompting an immediate political scramble over his successor and opening the door for new legal fights on hot-button social issues, such as abortion and gay marriage. Miller suggested that the Endangered Species Act would be the first environmental issue to take the stage on a Kennedy-less court: A dispute over the endangered dusky gopher frog, Weyerhaeuser v. US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), is now on the court's docket in the fall. That fight is over 1,500 acres of forest in Louisiana that the FWS designated as "critical habitat" for the survival of the species, even though the frogs don't live on it. The owners of the forest are challenging the government agency's ability to declare property as "critical habitat" when a species doesn't live on it, as well as the government not taking economic costs into account in making such designations. Further down the road, experts expect a fight over which of the nation's waterways are actually protected under the Clean Water Act to return to the Supreme Court, which sent lawsuits on this issue to district courts in January. Those lawsuits are challenging the Environmental Protection Agency's protection of some streams and waterways under rules narrowly written to conform to a 4–1–4 Rapanos v. United States decision made in 2006, where the "1" was Kennedy. The conservative wing of the court wanted to limit EPA's oversight to only big, navigable waterways in that case, and the liberal justices wanted essentially all small wetlands and streams protected too — but Kennedy ended up creating middle ground. He said the government should only be able to regulate smaller waterways that have a "significant nexus" with major ones. So, there was no majority opinion. Because all spaces protected under Kennedy's one-vote opinion also would be protected under the four liberal justices' view, however, his opinion is the one that effectively controlled decisions going forward." n this case, his lone opinion became the law," Bookbinder said. "That's how pivotal he was." More lawsuits are expected on this in response to Trump's EPA drafting its own controversial water rule. One area legal experts are split on is whether the 2007 decision that greenhouse gases are pollutants will be reconsidered." here's a been a lot of focus on whether that case will be reversed by a new majority," Joseph Goffman, executive director of Harvard's Environmental Law Program, told BuzzFeed News. While he doesn't dismiss this possibility out of hand, he's more concerned by the court incrementally chipping away at the government's authority to regulate climate pollution in other ways. NRDC's Doniger pointed out the landmark decision has been twice reaffirmed by the court. At the same time, it had already started to chip away at EPA's power to regulate greenhouse gasses in 2016 by halting enforcement of the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan aimed at curbing emissions from power plants. The Trump administration has since said it was pulling back that plan. Chief Justice John Roberts over the years has not been consistently opposed to environmental regulation or plain readings of pollution laws, Doniger added, suggesting that environmental plaintiffs in cases may turn their strategy to garnering his vote. And while there were many close cases involving the environment that came to the court during Kennedy's 30 years there, environmental advocates noted that not all of those cases were close." t's not like every environmental case was decided 5–4," Doniger said. "There are plenty of 6–3 or 7–2 cases where environmentally sound decisions, in our view, were made. So you really can't say the sky is falling."	False

MIT professor warns humanity will hit 'mass extinction' event — here's why A geophysics professor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says that he's run the numbers on humanity facing a "mass extinction event," and the numbers are not good. According to Digital Trends, a mass extinction event is an event "in which a large number of species become extinct at once — as was the case with the death of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Daniel Rothman told the publication that we are approaching a "threshold of catastrophe" in the carbon cycle similar to that of the five previous periods of mass extinction over the last 540 million years." he study identifies two thresholds for major carbon cycle change," Rothman said. "One is a critical rate of change, corresponding to the rate at which CO2 is added to the ocean/atmosphere system. The other, a critical size or mass, corresponds to the total carbon added to the oceans." Exceeding the critical rate at slow time scales — much greater than about 10,000 years — or exceeding the critical size at fast time scales — much less than about 10,000 years — is associated with mass extinction," he explained." The MIT research paper] predicts that the critical mass, about 300 gigatons of carbon," he concluded, "will likely be exceeded sometime this century. If so, following the paper's logic, the marine carbon cycle would proceed to follow a trajectory which could excite a mass extinction over a period of about 10,000 years." Rothman goes on to explain that the tipping point of "unknown territory" won't take that long – he predicts it will come as soon as 2100, or sooner. Rothman says that "decreasing carbon emissions," would be the best way to try to avoid the catastrophe. Those who point to discrepancies in the global warming narrative have also noted that many of the solutions offered by climate change advocates do very little to actually stop carbon emissions and turn back the clock.

President Trump Pulled Out of Paris Deal to Stick it to Elites On Thursday, President Donald J. Trump rejected failed former President Obama's disastrous Paris "global warming" deal that sought to burden our economy with heavy regulations and taxes all to push the left's global warming hysteria. In a Rose Garden speech, President Trump said he rejected the global warming agreement because "I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris," words that the global warming alarmists cannot comprehend. Now, a new report sheds some more light into why President Trump rejected the globalist scam, and it's incredible: specifically, he wanted to stick it to "holier-than-thou" elites in America, specifically leftists who fly around in private jets, drive SUVs, and live in massive mansions yet lecture Americans about their environmental impact." his is religion for the political left, and our supporters are constantly being asked to change their behavior," a top White House official told Axios, who added that "snarky comments" from European leaders also encouraged Trump to withdraw. The White House official said "Trump resented the corporate critics who 'ride in fossil-fuel-guzzling planes and SUVs, then act holier-than-thou,'" according to Axios. Trump announced he would withdraw the U.S. from the Paris agreement, which the Obama administration joined in 2016 after years of negotiating with United Nations member countries. Some 147 countries have ratified the Paris agreement. Trump said the Paris agreement was poorly negotiated and would harm the U.S. economy. Trump said the deal transferred wealth from the U.S. to economic rivals, like China and India. "I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris," Trump said. It's also important to note that the Obama administration didn't have the authority to commit the United States to a treaty without being ratified by the Senate – a crucial point that the liberal media deliberately ignores in order to attack President Trump. It's been rumored that Trump's liberal son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as well as his daughter Ivanka and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, pushed the President to remain in the global warming deal – but the President chose the American people instead.

Buildings disappear in the smog in Ulaanbaatar, where residents have resorted to sipping 'lung' tea and 'oxygen cocktails' in a desperate bid to protect themselves from pollution Fed up with the smog in Mongolia's capital, residents have resorted to sipping "lung" tea and "oxygen cocktails" in a desperate bid to protect themselves from pollution, despite health officials saying there is no evidence they work. Ulaanbaatar topped New Delhi and Beijing as the world's most polluted capital in 2016, UNICEF said in a report warning of a health crisis that has put every child and pregnancy at risk. With residents of so-called ger (slum) districts using coal stoves to cook and heat their homes in the world's coldest capital, where temperatures can dip as low as -40 Celsius (-40 Fahrenheit), pollution has skyrocketed. While most of the pollution comes from stoves in the gers, road transport and power plants add to the toxic mix. On January 30, air pollution was 133 times higher than the safe limit set by the World Health Organization (WHO). UNICEF reported that cases of respiratory infections have nearly tripled and pneumonia is now the second leading cause of death for children under five. Worried parents have held protests to press the government to take action. But some businesses are cashing in, even though a WHO official says there is no evidence that such anti-smog products work. Batbayariin Munguntuul sitting with her children while an air purifier runs at her home in Ulaanbaatar Advertisements in Mongolia boast that "drinking just one oxygen cocktail is equal to a three-hour-walk in a lush forest". At the produce section of the State Department Store, blue cans of oxygen called "Life Is Air" are on sale for $2, and promise to turn a glass of juice into a foamy, sweet "oxygen cocktail" after spraying some into a glass through a special straw. Other stores and pharmacies have oxygen cocktail machines that resemble coffee makers and can turn a juice into a frothy drink for $1. Pregnant women are among the most avid customers of the Russian-made product, with some saying they are following their doctor's orders. Batbayar Munguntuul, a 34-year-old accountant and mother of three, drank oxygen cocktails when she was pregnant, but she ended up spending much more money on medicine." Every winter we constantly buy medicine," she told AFP. "It has reached a point that it is like just any other grocery product that you have to buy regularly." Like many other Mongolians, she has chosen to buy an air purifier to make sure her family breathes clean air at home. Her machine, which filters out toxic fumes, cost her $300. The average level of PM2.5 particles -- which penetrate deep into the lungs -- was 75 micrograms per cubic metre last year, or three times the exposure recommended by the WHO for a 24-hour period. Air pollution has been linked to asthma, bronchitis, and other long-term respiratory diseases. Some Mongolians drinking special teas named Enkhjin, Ikh Taiga, and Dr. Baatar that claim to clean lungs. Dr. Baatar's CEO, Baatar Chantsaldulam, said sales surge by 20 to 30 percent during winter, when pollution tends to reach its peak." First it takes all the toxins out of the blood, then it turns the toxins in the lung into mucus, and all the plants in tea helps boost the human immune system," he told AFP. But Maria Neira, the head of the WHO's public health department, said the "real solution" to protect the lungs and the cardiovascular system was to reduce air pollution and avoid exposure to it." The business community will offer plenty of those solutions," Neira said, referring to the oxygen cocktails and lung teas." We don't have any scientific evidence whether they provide any benefit," she said." For the past 10 years, people have known that air pollution has reached dangerous levels," Parents Against Smog coordinator Tumur Mandakhjargal told AFP." However, policymakers only address the issue by talking about passing out clean stoves and clean coal," Mandakhjargal said. The NGO says the government should give some 200,000 ger residents access to loans so that they install heating insulation and replace their stoves with cleaner heaters. It also complains that a ger relocation plan has been too slow. The government spent $120 million between 2008-2016 to combat pollution, with half of the funds coming out of its foreign aid revenue. Part of the money has gone to distributing low-emission stoves to residents of ger districts. Last year, the parliament approved a tax exemption for companies that sell air purifiers, while Prime Minister Ukhnaa Khurelsukh issued an order to distribute $1.6 million worth of the appliances to all schools. Non-profit organisations are giving away air purifiers and anti-smog masks to schools, kindergartens and hospitals. The non-profit group Smog and Kids donated a South Korean-made air ventilation system to a kindergarten in one of the capital's most polluted areas, and the difference in air quality inside and outside the classrooms is palpable. Such systems can cost up to $2,500 plus $500 for installation. But Smog and Kids representative Tumendalai Davaadalai said air purifiers were not the answer to the problem."

"With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century — more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many U.S. states," according to the assessment.	But as Vox's David Roberts has detailed, "[t]here is no consistent evidence that environmental regulations cause long-term changes in overall employment."		US ambassador to Canada tries to "both sides" climate science During an interview with CBC, the new US ambassador to Canada, Kelly Craft, claimed she believes "both sides" of climate science. Asked, "Do you believe in climate change?" Craft responded, "I believe there are scientists on both sides that are accurate." Do you believe there is science that proves that man is not causing climate change?" the interviewer followed up." ell, I think that both sides have, you know, their own results from their studies, and I appreciate and respect both sides of the science," Craft said. Though several members of the Trump administration, including President Trump himself, continue to cast doubt on humans' role in the changing climate without providing any evidence, it's simply not a matter on which scientists disagree at all. The latest National Climate Assessment, written by more than 300 scientists at 13 US federal agencies including the Department of Defense and NASA, for instance, opens with the statement: "Earth's climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities." The report goes on to detail the toll climate change has already taken on health, quality of life, and the economy of the US and how those impacts will mount if emissions are not dramatically reduced in the coming years. "With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century — more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many U.S. states," according to the assessment. The Trump administration released the report ahead of schedule on the Friday after Thanksgiving — a move many interpreted as an attempt to bury the findings. The facts of climate science and the urgency of the climate threat to the US are a nuisance to an administration that has consistently prioritized the demands of the fossil fuel industry to roll back federal policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. And Trump has appointed a number of officials like Craft whose allegiance to industry is clear. In 2016, Craft reportedly donated $265,400 toward Trump's election and $17,000 to the Republican National Committee. Craft's husband, Joseph Craft, is a billionaire coal magnate. A Global News report from 2017 provides some details about him:While the Crafts have a personal financial stake in pushing climate denialism, other prominent Republicans have tried to tamp down on the conclusions of the Climate Assessment by citing concerns about the impact curbing greenhouse gas emissions would have on "industry and jobs."

The US southeast is already experiencing repeated droughts, it is already experiencing heatwaves, it is the last place to plant a eucalyptus plantation."	As that is not likely to happen, she said "there is no way to know the full scope of the risks."	If you can increase yields by 40 percent, you can greatly reduce prices.	Petermann said another red flag is wildfires.		250,000 Americans, 500 groups reject genetically-modified eucalyptus trees Over 250,000 Americans and 500 organizations submitted comments rejecting the US Department of Agriculture's (USDA) proposal to approve genetically-engineered eucalyptus trees for planting. If approved, the trees would be planted in seven southern states. Public comments on the USDA's draft environmental impact statement (dEIS) closed on Wednesday. The agency will now evaluate the comments for a final review on whether to approve the GE trees. Activists from the South Pacific Islands, Southern Asia and North and South America weighed in, rejecting all genetically-engineered trees, including field trials. Critics of the dEIS said the USDA downplayed the risks posed by the GE trees. The agency predicts GE eucalyptus plantations would cover over 1 million across seven states from coastal South Carolina to eastern Texas. The GE eucalyptus trees, developed by biotech companies such as FuturaGene and ArborGen, are designed to tolerate freezing temperatures and to help feed demand for pulp and paper production, biomass pellets for electricity and fuel for cars. Anne Petermann, executive director at the Global Justice Ecology Project, said the tradition has been for the government to rubberstamp genetically-engineered organisms "but this would be the first time they are approving a genetically-engineered forest tree." She said ArborGen asked for approval to legalize the trees six years ago." They (USDA) are really taking their time with it becuase they know there is overwhelming public opposition to [the plan]," Petermann told RT. Petermann said there is a lack of independent research on the long-term, or even short-term, consequences of putting genetically-engineered trees out into the environment, and that the risks could be significant." e are talking about forest ecosystems that have evolved over millions of years," Petermann said. "Planting eucalyptus trees, with mutations in their genomes - how are these organisms going to interact with the forest? How are they going to interact with soil micro-organisms? Those studies have not been done, and that is one of the major points in the comments." Petermann said if the studies were to be done they would have to be carried out over the full life of the tree, between 50 to 100 years. As that is not likely to happen, she said "there is no way to know the full scope of the risks." Eucalyptus trees are the number one industrial tree plantation used in Latin America, Africa and Asia, traditionally in tropical areas, where commerce appreciates their fast growth and versatility." he forest products industry is worth $400 billion a year. This technology is worth billions of dollars a year. If you can increase yields by 40 percent, you can greatly reduce prices. Eucalyptus today are harvested at seven years – in Brazil we are looking to produce the same sized trees in five and a half years," Stanley Hirsch, chief executive of the Israeli biotech company FuturaGene, told the Guardian in 2012 over its plans to plant GM eucalyptus in Brazil. Documented as an invasive species around the world, the trees have escaped the limits of their plantations in South Africa and shown up in native grasslands, and in Chile where they are showing up in the forests. In the US, the trees only grow in Southern Florida and California, hence the need for a genetically-engineered variety to withstand temperature variations in other states. Petermann said another red flag is wildfires. She points to the massive wildlife that hit Portugal last month that left 60 people dead, and one that happened in Chile in January. Both were fed by eucalyptus plantations." ucalyptus is extremely flammable," said Petermann. "Combine that with dry conditions, which these trees exacerbate because they drink so much, you end with these incredible firestorms. The US southeast is already experiencing repeated droughts, it is already experiencing heatwaves, it is the last place to plant a eucalyptus plantation." Among other commentators was former NASA scientist Kate Cato, who lives in the US south and has mapped parts of Mars. She said it was clear that the planet once had rivers and great amounts of water, and possibly an atmosphere similar to ours, "but a global catastrophe had happened." She said the effects of invasive species such as kudzu, lionfish and Australian pines have already caused chaos in the southern states where they lack predators and displace native plants and animals, and already cost the states millions of dollars in losses and eradication.

The 2015 decision allowed the EPA to intervene in states that fail to meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards, forcing them to adopt federal regulatory plans to reduce ozone emissions that generally come from power plants, refineries and cement factories. It opens the door to drastic changes in how science is used to set clean air rules, disqualifying huge amounts of peer-reviewed public health research in favor of industry-backed studies in a move that builds on steps EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has already taken. The order requires the EPA to speed up reviews of state plans to reduce air pollution, setting a strict 18-month deadline, and complete reviews of all pre-construction permits for industry within a year. Construction permitting is primarily a state-level issue; the language in the order, critics say, appears to be a dog whistle to polluters, suggesting the EPA would pull back on any oversight." he purpose is that if states make determinations that are somewhat less than the rigor of what might be expected, EPA won't second guess it," Stan Meiburg, a former acting deputy EPA administrator who spent 39 years at the agency, told HuffPost by phone. "It's a go-ahead for industry that if they take their best shot at states, the EPA won't be getting in the way." The order instructs the EPA to consider what countries that don't border the United States are doing to reduce pollution, allowing the agency to compare U.S. regulations to those in developing nations like China and India. It also directs Pruitt to allow states to trade pollution permits, a move environmentalists warn could make offsets nearly impossible to track and police. In what could be the most controversial part, the order requires the EPA's science advisers to consider the downside of cleaner air rules, something for which industry groups have clamored for years. They argue the policies could raise electricity costs and make things like air conditioning more expensive. That directive is likely to prompt watchdog groups to sue. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 2001, in a decision written by late Justice Antonin Scalia, that the EPA cannot consider the costs of implementation when setting air quality standards. It marks the latest assault on clean air rules, putting poor people and communities of color particularly at risk. People living below the poverty line were exposed to 1.35 times more particulate matter than those living above it, according to a landmark EPA study released in February. People of color breathe in 1.2 times more particulate matter pollution, and black people, in particular, are on average exposed to 1.54 times more particulate matter pollution than the general pollution. The National Association of the Advancement of Colored People released a report in February that found black people are exposed to air that is 38 percent more polluted than white people on average, and they are 75 percent more likely to live in communities abutting industrial sites." eople who are most affected by air pollution are the most vulnerable and these policy changes would mean even less protection for those people," Janet McCabe, who served as the assistant administrator for the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation until 2017, told HuffPost by phone. "It could mean yet more pollution in their neighborhoods." The new order could put the administration at loggerheads with California regulators again. But the quiet rollout of the memorandum avoided swift criticisms. The California Air Resources Board told HuffPost the agency had not yet reviewed the ordered by Thursday afternoon." his is yet another example of this administration selling out our future to industry polluters – it's nothing more than a naked attempt to attack science, gut our clean air protections, and put polluter profits ahead of our health," Sara Jordan, a legislative representative at the nonpartisan League of Conservation Voters, said in a statement.

Trump brags about 'crystal clean' air — but his own EPA admits it's gotten dirtier Trump regularly brags about making America's air cleaner, but evidence from his own Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shows the opposite is happening: The air we breathe is getting dirtier. New EPA data shows that since 2016, a decades-long trend of improving air quality has started to backslide. In both 2017 and 2018, the number of unhealthy air days in metropolitan areas increased 15% compared to the last four years of President Obama's administration, the Associated Press reported Tuesday. That's the exact opposite of what Trump regularly claims. During his embarrassing trip to Ireland in early June, Trump said, "We have the cleanest air in the world, in the United States, and it's gotten better since I'm president." At his big rally Tuesday in Orlando, Trump made a similar false claim: "We have among the cleanest and sharpest — crystal clean, you've heard me say it, I want it crystal clean — air and water anywhere on Earth." Air pollution leads to the premature death of 100,000 Americans every year, the AP reports, and Trump's own EPA shows not only worse air pollution, but a significant increase in the two worst categories: "very unhealthy" and "hazardous" conditions. During the Trump administration, U.S. cities saw air pollution in one of these two categories nearly 140 times, which is almost three times as often as the average from 2013 to 2016. In fact, the AP notes that the four years from 2013 and 2016, Obama's second term in office, were a "clean air heyday" for America that boasted the fewest unhealthy air days since 1980. That heyday appears to be over for now. To make matters worse, on Wednesday the EPA finalized what will be its "biggest climate policy rollback," according to the Washington Post. The new rule will allow coal plants to spew more pollution into the air than a previous rule put in place by President Obama. The new rule "is really a dereliction of duty — moral, ethical, but also legal," Andres Restrepo, a lawyer with the Sierra Club's Environmental Law Program, told the Post. Scientists are unclear as to the exact reasons air pollution has gotten worse under Trump, but they say it's very clear that his policies will make the situation worse." There is zero reason to expect any other outcome" than worsening air quality if Trump continues to roll back regulations, Neil Donahue, an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University, told the AP. While Trump has been in office, the air has gotten dirtier. His lies don't make it cleaner, and his policies are on track to make it worse. Published with permission of The American Independent.

(This tally doesn't include penalties from EPA's Superfund program, criminal cases, or the administrative actions that EPA takes to resolve smaller violations.	)The number of civil cases filed by the EPA to collect these fines in the first place has also declined.	ess enforcement doesn't mean there aren't a whole lot of violations that are out there," said Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, who led the civil enforcement office at the EPA under Presidents Clinton and Bush, in a call with reporters. <sep> 	How Trump is letting polluters off the hook, in one chart In his first year as head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt has made a huge mark, shrinking his agency and repealing as many Obama-era environmental regulations as possible. And as I pointed out last month in this feature story, he's also overseen a drastic slowdown in the day-to-day work of the agency. Key offices remain vacant and the implementation of new environmental rules has stalled, effectively throttling the agency. But one of EPA's most important jobs is to enforce civil penalties for companies that breach limits for hazardous chemicals like sulfur dioxide and hydrochloric acid. And one new measure of Pruitt's foot-dragging that's just emerged is how much money EPA has been collecting from polluters lately. According to a new report from the Environmental Integrity Project, a watchdog group that advocates for enforcement of environmental laws, the amount of fines collected by Trump's EPA has plummeted compared to the agency under the past three presidents in their first year in office. Check out this chart:The fines come from consent decrees, a type of legal settlement where a party has to take a specific action but does not have to admit fault or liability. The consent decrees here involve violations of federal environmental laws like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. (This tally doesn't include penalties from EPA's Superfund program, criminal cases, or the administrative actions that EPA takes to resolve smaller violations.)The number of civil cases filed by the EPA to collect these fines in the first place has also declined. In President Clinton's first year, there were 73; under Bush, 112; under Obama, 71. In 2017, there were just 48 cases. What this means is that the EPA is not going after polluters like it used to." ess enforcement doesn't mean there aren't a whole lot of violations that are out there," said Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, who led the civil enforcement office at the EPA under Presidents Clinton and Bush, in a call with reporters. He noted that many of these civil cases take months to complete, so some of the cases completed under Trump started under Obama. In a consent decree reached with Exxon Mobil last October, the EPA boasted that the company would spend $300 million to install pollution controls, but Schaeffer noted that this total includes measures installed as far back as 2013. And it's likely enforcement will decline further for ongoing environmental investigations." any of those cases will drop out of sight if Congress agrees to cut the agency's enforcement budget by 17 percent, as President Trump has proposed," according to the report. "Enforcement matters, especially to the people who live and work next to plants that continue to release more pollution than the law allows." The EPA did not respond to a request for comment.	False

Air pollution is not just bad for health also makes people unhappy, a new study has shown. Researchers at MIT and the University of Beijing discovered a direct link between the amount of particulates in the air and happiness. Research has previously shown that air pollution is damaging to health, cognitive performance, labor productivity, and educational outcomes. But air pollution also has a broader impact on people's social lives and behavior, according Siqi Zheng, the Samuel Tak Lee Associate Professor in MIT's Department of Urban Studies"Pollution also has an emotional cost," said Dr Zheng. "People are unhappy, and that means they may make irrational decisions." Researchers used pollution data from 144 Chinese cities and monitored general happiness of urban dwellers by looking at the mood using 210 million messages from China's largest microblogging platform, Sina Weibo. They found a significantly negative correlation between pollution and happiness levels, with every increase in pollution above a healthy level bringing happiness down by 0.04 points out of 100. On Monday some parts of London recorded Air Quality Index (AQI) levels of 151, more than 100 points above healthy limits. It suggests that people were four points unhappier than they would have been without polluted levels. For China, pollution can rise into the 700s, which could be having a major impact on happiness. Women were also found to me more sensitive to higher pollution levels than men, as were those on higher incomes. The research was published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour.	False

Wyoming's economy is dominated by coal, other fossil fuels, and mineral extraction. The formula here has worked — residents in Wyoming enjoy among the highest per capita GDP in the nation. So naturally, there's been some hostility toward new sources of energy that could threaten that." It's a complicated history with wind," says Jeremiah Rieman, director of economic diversification strategy for Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead (R). "I think you're seeing a change. And certainly we're hearing the message loud and clear, as we go through this economic diversification strategy effort, that wind and renewables need to be a part of that." The push toward wind is playing out in a high-rise office building 100 miles south of Wyoming's capital in Denver. There, TransWest Express is laying out plans to build a 730-mile transmission line across the American West. CEO Bill Miller points to a map and the start of the project — 1,000 wind turbines to be built on a ranch in south-central Wyoming." It starts there and runs a little bit west and then due south into northwest Colorado," says Miller, tracing a line through Utah and then down south of Las Vegas. If all goes according to plan, in three years Miller says the winds of low-population Wyoming will be bringing electricity to where it's needed in California." To my knowledge, this is the largest transmission line development that has occurred in this country in probably 50 years." TransWest Express, which is part of the Anschutz Corporation owned by billionaire Phillip Anschutz, is looking to harness Wyoming's wind because, well, it's super windy. The winds howl in southeast Wyoming because they're rising at the continental divide, then pushing through a gap in the Rocky Mountains." So, if you remember your high school physics class there's this thing called the Venturi effect where you narrow something and that naturally speeds up an air flow. And that's really what we have here," says economist Robert Godby, director of the Center for Energy Economics and Public Policy at the University of Wyoming. Wyoming may have strong winds, but the state ranks just 16th for wind generation. Godby says Wyoming hasn't exactly made things attractive for developers: "We have the only wind generation tax in the country, where we actually tax people who produce electricity with wind." Meanwhile, many other states are creating incentives for wind development, for example by creating renewable portfolio standards that require a state to obtain a certain amount of its energy from sources like wind and solar."I think it's really unfair that Wyoming has this reputation for being hostile to wind or anti-wind," says Jason Beggar, director the Wyoming Infrastructure Authority, a state entity tasked with developing large transmission projects." It's not an anti-wind philosophy, it's just the philosophy of the state — we tax our natural resources to fund government." Beggar says it's tough to build in Wyoming because roughly half of the state is federally owned land." So when you go to Texas, or you go to Iowa, you're generally just negotiating with a landowner, whether it's a farmer, whomever," says Beggar. "Well, in Wyoming, you have to file permits with the federal government and that includes things [like] land use, wildlife mitigation, mineral disturbances. There are factors and factors and factors." Beggar says the Trump administration has shown a "willingness" to cut red tape and move things along more quickly. Meanwhile, conservationists and environmentalists have bristled at the rollback of regulations. There's another challenge facing Wyoming wind: climate change skepticism. Coal burns dirty and produces a lot of greenhouse gases. Many states are pushing renewable energy to move away from that. But in Wyoming, it's complicated." Climate change is a pretty tough subject to talk about with some people because it's a threat no matter how you look at it," says Robert Godby. "It's a threat to world climate, it's also a threat to people's livelihoods [in Wyoming]. And those two things are kind of in conflict. If you're a state like Wyoming where you produce so much fossil fuel, in particular coal, that's threatened by any sort of climate change policy we might put in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions." Wyoming's governor, Matt Mead, professes skepticism on climate science, but not on the markets, which are moving away from dirtier-burning fuels like coal. That's why he's pushing for a more diversified economy. At the end of the day, the debate in Wyoming is really about jobs. Bill Miller says that when people learn about the tax revenues and jobs their transmission line and wind farm will bring to Wyoming, they like that." These are good, high-paying jobs. And when we finish this project, the permanent jobs are going to be roughly 150 people, well paid, fully benefitted jobs that are really a boon to those communities," says Miller. Wind projects in Wyoming won't come anywhere close to creating enough work to replace the coal industry. Still, the jobs are an important part of the state's broader diversification strategy." Roughly 60 percent of our youth, between the ages of 18 and 24, will not be here 10 years from now, and that's a trend we would like to see disappear," says Rieman. Whether new opportunities come from digging up coal or harnessing the wind, for job seekers in Wyoming, that detail may be of secondary importance.

The withdrawal will be complete this time next year, after a one-year waiting period has elapsed." We will continue to work with our global partners to enhance resilience to the impacts of climate change and prepare for and respond to natural disasters," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement Monday. Nearly 200 countries signed on to the agreement in 2015 and made national pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Each country set its own goals, and many wealthy countries, including the U.S., also agreed to help poorer countries pay for the costs associated with climate change. The U.S. is now the only country to pull out of the pact." The United States is not cooperating with the rest of the world on dealing with climate change," says Andrew Light, a former climate official in the State Department who helped develop the Paris Agreement. The agreement was designed to be easier to join than to leave. The U.S. even helped spearhead language that would hold countries accountable for the promises they made, in part to help guard against regime changes and other global political turmoil. Indeed, in the years since the pact was created, many key international players, including Brazil, China, Japan and India, have experienced economic or political upheaval, but none has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement as a result. President Trump originally announced his intention to withdraw from the deal in the summer of 2017, shortly after he took office. At the time he said, "As of today, the United States will cease all implementation" of the agreement, including federal policies meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as well as U.S. contributions to the international climate fund for poorer nations." These agreements are just only as good as the commitments from each country," Light says. The U.S. had pledged to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions by about a quarter by 2025, compared with 2005 levels. The country is not on track to achieve that goal. In the intervening years, the Trump administration has systematically attempted to roll back federal limits on carbon emissions, including rules about how much pollution can be emitted by power plants, cars and trucks." The reality is, to really deliver on our climate goals, we do need strong federal action," says Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Concerned Scientists. "The unfortunate reality is U.S. carbon emissions actually rose last year." This isn't the first time the U.S. has reneged on an international climate agreement. The U.S. failed to ratify the 1997 Kyoto Protocol despite being instrumental in its creation. In this case, the U.S. became a signatory to the agreement but almost immediately signaled that it didn't intend to pursue its responsibilities. In both cases, the U.S. was instrumental in developing the international strategy." That's one of the ironies of all this," Light says. When the Paris Agreement was being negotiated, the U.S. delegation pushed for more transparency and accountability to make sure the countries that signed on would actually do what they promised." Even though we're the ones who have been pointing to these potential scenarios for problems with other countries, we seem to be the biggest problem," Light says." If we were a tiny country with small emissions, it wouldn't matter so much," he says. "But we're not. We're a big country with a lot of power and a lot of influence around the world. And so for us to be the exception on this issue is holding the world back."A formal withdrawal is reversible, however, if a future administration chooses to rejoin the Paris Agreement and pick up where the U.S. left off with its emissions reduction promises.

391	thedailycaller	right_bias	2018-11-26	But even the United Nations' worst-case scenario, called RCP8.5, is being called into question by experts.	University of Colorado professor Roger Pielke, Jr. pointed out problems with the study on Twitter Saturday, including the fact it was funded by groups connected with Bloomberg and Steyer.	The oft-repeated claim also stemmed from a global warming projection that's come under increased scrutiny from experts, including one who called it "outlandish."	The federal report issued dire warnings, including from "ice sheet disintegration on accelerated sea level rise, leading to widespread effects on coastal development lasting thousands of years."	All told, the report says, climate change could slash up to a tenth of gross domestic product by 2100, more than double the losses of the Great Recession a decade ago," The New York Times reported of the NCA.		A Top-Line Claim In The Newest US Climate Report Relies On Research Tied To Major Democratic Donors It's been repeated throughout the media: Future global warming could wipe-out one-tenth of the U.S. economy by 2100. It's a top-line finding of a major government climate report, but it's based on a study funded by groups affiliated with two major Democratic donors. The oft-repeated claim also stemmed from a global warming projection that's come under increased scrutiny from experts, including one who called it "outlandish." The federal government released the second volume of the National Climate Assessment (NCA) Friday. The federal report issued dire warnings, including from "ice sheet disintegration on accelerated sea level rise, leading to widespread effects on coastal development lasting thousands of years." The report also claims that "global greenhouse gas emissions is expected to cause substantial net damage to the U.S. economy throughout this century," including a 10 percent hit to gross domestic product (GDP) in one extreme scenario. (RELATED: Trump Touts 'Oil Prices Getting Lower' As Millions Hit The Road For Thanksgiving)However, NCA's dire prediction of a 10 percent hit to U.S. GDP comes from a 2017 study supported by the charitable foundations founded by major Democratic donors. The study was also funded by other organizations, including the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy and the Skoll Global Threats Fund. That 2017 study, published in the journal Science, was funded in part by Bloomberg Philanthropies and Next Generation, which were founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and San Francisco billionaire Tom Steyer, respectively. University of Colorado professor Roger Pielke, Jr. pointed out problems with the study on Twitter Saturday, including the fact it was funded by groups connected with Bloomberg and Steyer. Bloomberg and Steyer were the biggest donors to Democratic-aligned political action groups in the 2016 election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics (CRP). Bloomberg, who founded Bloomberg Philanthropies, handed nearly $60 million to liberal SuperPACs to help put Democratic candidates in office and defeat Republicans in the 2018 election cycle, according to the CRP. Steyer, who co-founded Next Generation, gave roughly $58.7 million to liberal SuperPACs, according to CRP. Bloomberg and Steyer back the Paris climate accord and Obama-era policies to phase out fossil fuels. The Bloomberg-Steyer-funded study found future temperature rise could cost "roughly 1.2% of gross domestic product per [additional one degree Celsius increase] on average." At the most extreme high-end, that could add up to 10 percent of GDP by 2100. Pielke called the use of such an extreme scenario "embarrassing" because it's based on a future that's 15 degrees Fahrenheit warmer — in other words, twice what the United Nations' most extreme scenario projects. But even the United Nations' worst-case scenario, called RCP8.5, is being called into question by experts. A study published in 2017 found RCP8.5 was "exceptionally unlikely" because it suffered from "systematic errors in fossil production outlooks." Imagine if research funded by Exxon was sole basis for claims. Given weaknesses of the work [it's] just [foolish] to lean on it so much," Pielke tweeted. Major media outlets' however, did no such examination of the NCA's reliance on such an "outlandish" claim, as Pielke called it. CNN reported "the economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars — or, in the worst-case scenario, more than 10% of its GDP" by 2100. The news outlets' headline warned future warming could also "kill thousands." All told, the report says, climate change could slash up to a tenth of gross domestic product by 2100, more than double the losses of the Great Recession a decade ago," The New York Times reported of the NCA. Andrew Light, a distinguished senior fellow at the World Resources Institute and reviewer of the chapter highlighting the Bloomberg-Steyer-funded study did not respond to The Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment. Instead, Light forwarded TheDCNF's request to the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), which is responsible for producing the NCA. USGCRP has yet to respond to TheDCNF's request. The NCA was put together with input from 13 federal agencies and outside scientists.

On one side, leaders of Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, plus two EU representatives. On the other side, President Trump. And up for debate, the peril of climate change and the urgency of the U.S. commitment to the Paris accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Merkel said that everyone at the table at the G-7 summit in Taormina, Italy, was urging Trump to stick with the pact, according to Reuters. After that conversation, Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn said the president's views are "evolving" and that he feels "much, much more knowledgeable" after the conversation with world leaders." He came here to learn. He came here to get smarter," Cohn said. "His views are evolving, which is exactly as they should be." Any decision on climate change would ultimately be based on what's best for the United States, Cohn said. The Paris accord, created in 2015 after lengthy negotiations, calls on 196 nations to ratchet back greenhouse gas emissions. The goal is to keep the rise in global temperatures no higher than 2 degrees Celsius, as compared with pre-industrial levels. (As NPR reported at the time, the global average temperature has already increased about 1 degree Celsius.)The deal includes voluntary pledges to reduce emissions. It also calls for developed countries to provide billions of dollars to help the developing world switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. The accord was historic in its scope and its ambition, even though its reliance on voluntary pledges made it less robust than some advocates had hoped. On the campaign trail, Trump said he would "cancel" the Paris deal. He has previously suggested that climate change is a hoax and appointed as the head of the EPA a man who said he does not believe human activity is a primary contributor to global warming. (Climate change and its impacts have been observed by scientists working in multiple fields, and the overwhelming scientific consensus is that human activity is the primary cause.)But since taking office, Trump has not moved to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris agreement. He has rolled back a number of Obama-era climate change measures, which will hamper U.S. efforts to fulfill its Paris pledges. But he hasn't retracted the pledges themselves. Just this week, members of his administration indicated that the White House had not yet decided what to do on the issue. Before the conversation between Trump and the other G-7 leaders, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni noted that all the other countries had confirmed "total agreement" to the pact, while the U.S. commitment was an "open question." We are sure that after an internal reflection, the United States will also want to commit to it," Gentiloni said, according to the Associated Press. But Gentolini and other world leaders weren't just waiting for internal reflection. They added some external pressure, too. French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly discussed climate change with Trump at length on Thursday at a meeting in Brussels. Leaders of the Roman Catholic Church broached the topic when Trump visited the Vatican. And then there was the chat between the G-7 leaders. Merkel called the conversation "controversial." Cohn said it was "robust." Still to be determined: whether it was persuasive, or consequential.	True

White House won't say if Trump is a climate change denier The White House has declined to say whether Donald Trump believes human activity contributes to climate change as the president pulled America out of the Paris agreement. Administration officials were also unable to offer revised US carbon emission targets or say what changes to the global landmark accord would persuade Trump to re-enter it. But they did offer assurance that America will abide by the lengthy exit process outlined in the deal, waiting three-and-a-half years to formally withdraw. Trump announced on Thursday the US would join Nicaragua and Syria as the only countries to shun the Paris agreement, characterising it as "a reassertion of America's sovereignty" and saying he was "elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris". There was a chorus of condemnation from world leaders, former president Barack Obama and Trump's defeated election opponent Hillary Clinton, who branded it "a historic mistake". Shortly after Trump spoke in the Rose Garden at the White House to applause from supporters, two senior administration officials briefed reporters in the west wing. The officials, who did not wish to be named, did nothing to alter perceptions of the US president as a climate change denier when asked whether he believed human activity was a contributory factor. One official replied: "So I think the fact that the president in his speech today said he wants to come back and renegotiate a better deal for the United States and for the world I think speaks for itself." The journalist shot back: "So is that a yes? It's a yes or no question." The official said: "Again, I think that speaks for itself." The journalist pressed: "It doesn't speak for itself, so is that a yes? Does he believe human activity contributes to climate change?"The official said: "I have not talked to the president about his personal views on whether – I was not with the president on his trip. I did not talk to the president about his personal views on what is contributing to climate change." The official insisted his own views were irrelevant, while a White House staff member interjected: "Can we stay on topic please?" The official echoed: "Can we stay on topic please?" – implying that Trump's views on the causes of climate change were irrelevant to the Paris decision. On 27 March the same official proved evasive on Trump's views when questioned by the Guardian. This week Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, also said he had not asked the president's opinion on the matter. Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, has said he "would not agree" that carbon from human activity is the primary cause of global warming while, in 2014, Trump referred to it as a "hoax". On Thursday, in a speech that kept a campaign pledge and echoed the fiery "America first" nationalism of his inaugural address, Trump said: "As of today, the United States will cease all implementation of the non-binding Paris accord." During Obama's tenure, the US had agreed under the accord to reduce emissions by more than a quarter below 2005 levels by 2025. The administration officials declined to specify new targets or give even a rough estimate of America's intended nationally determined contribution to limiting greenhouse gas emissions. But they pointed to America's existing record. "I think leading the world is pretty good, right?" one said. "I think that speaks for itself." The Paris accord came into effect on 4 November 2016. It makes provision for parties to withdraw, but notice can be given only three years after it kicks in. Withdrawal would take effect a year after that, meaning November 2020, a date that coincides with the next US presidential election – raising the prospect that the issue remains alive during the campaign." irst of all, the whole withdrawal process will be consistent with the Paris agreement," an official said. "So the Paris agreement has to be in force for three years before you can actually submit a notice formally for withdrawal, which takes at least a year." uring this period, the United States will not acknowledge or do anything to implement the current pledge put down by President Obama. Now what's the negotiating process? I think that's going to be determined by the president as we move forward." The leaders of France, Germany and Italy joined to express regret at Trump's decision and insisted the agreement "cannot be renegotiated". One of the administration officials responded: "If you look at the Europeans, if you look at other major economies or allies or partners, they have a strong interest in finding common ground with the United States and again, we don't want to get out ahead of ourselves here on what may be discussed or not." here are a lot of different issues related to the international climate agenda that may not necessarily fall into the Paris bucket per se." He added: "The president is very sincere when he says he wants a better deal, he wants to negotiate, potentially bringing us back in Paris depending on what that looks like ... I think it's a little bit more nuanced than stay in or not." Officials at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) challenged a set of talking points issued to support Trump's decision as misleading. A statement from MIT said: "The relevant MIT researchers believe that the Paris agreement is an unprecedented and vital effort by nearly 200 countries to respond to the urgent threat of global climate change."

The Interior Department's proposed overhaul would loosen the inspection and oversight requirements for this equipment. <sep> 	Trump Team Cited Obama-Era Safety Rules In Offshore Drilling Plan, Then Gutted Them The Trump administration pointed to key offshore drilling safety regulations adopted in the wake of the catastrophic 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in its sweeping proposal to open up nearly all U.S. waters to oil and gas development, only to turn around in the months since and work to roll back those very safeguards. The controversial drilling plan, released in January as part of President Donald Trump's "energy dominance" agenda, would make available for oil and gas leasing roughly 90 percent of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf, including large swaths of the Arctic, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The Interior Department, led by Secretary Ryan Zinke, noted in the lengthy proposal that while offshore oil and gas production "will never be totally risk-free," the agency "has made, and is continuing to make, substantial reforms to improve the safety and reduce the possible adverse environmental impacts" of those activities. Elizabeth Johnson Klein, the Interior Department's associate deputy secretary under Obama, said the language first appeared in a draft of the current program, released in January 2015. She said it references the Well Control Rule and the Production Safety Systems Rule, two regulations that were under development back in early 2015 and are now on Trump's chopping block. The language also points to broader reform efforts that occurred after the Gulf spill, including the division of the Minerals Management Service, the scandal-plagued agency faced with the conflicting tasks of issuing leases and policing offshore drilling operations, into three new agencies. Days before the Trump administration unveiled its plans for a massive expansion of offshore drilling, it moved to weaken the Production Safety Systems Rule, a set of regulations pertaining to maintenance of offshore platforms. At the time, the Interior Department's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement ― one of the agencies born out of the reorganization of the Minerals Management Service ― estimated that the move would save companies some $288 million over 10 years. The changes, finalized last month and slated to take effect on Dec. 27, loosen notification and certification rules for fossil fuel companies and toss out a requirement that offshore equipment be designed to withstand the most extreme weather and pressure conditions. In May, the Trump administration took aim at the Well Control Rule, a safety monitoring regulation meant to prevent the kind of incident that killed 11 workers and resulted in some 200 million gallons of crude oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico. Finalized in 2016, six years after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, the rule requires additional inspection and maintenance of blowout preventers, a device designed to automatically seal a well and stop an uncontrolled release of oil and gas. The Interior Department's proposed overhaul would loosen the inspection and oversight requirements for this equipment. Like the rollback of the Production Safety Systems Rule, this effort is all about helping industry. In fact, many of the proposed changes to the Well Control Rule were requested by oil companies, as Eric Lipton of The New York Times reported in March. In comments submitted to the agency in August, 10 state attorneys general argued that weakening the rule at the same time as the Trump administration is looking to radically expand offshore drilling "is analogous to taping over the mirrors and unbuckling one's seat belt just before getting on the highway." Donald Boesch, a professor of marine science at the University of Maryland who served on the bipartisan commission that investigated the causes of the Deepwater Horizon blowout, said easing the safety rules is both "premature" and "ill-considered." He also expressed concern about merging the two agencies, but said the administration has in effect already done that by putting the safety bureau in the hands of Angelle, a big proponent of offshore fossil fuel development. In April 2017, Trump signed an executive order aimed at opening up protected areas of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans to oil and gas leasing. It instructed the Interior Department to review the current five-year program and write new rules for offshore oil and gas drilling under the guise of an "America-First Offshore Energy Strategy." If approved, the leasing plan would go into effect from 2019 to 2024 and replace the current program, which is set to run through 2022 and was approved following an extensive, multiyear review. The offshore drilling announcement drew immediate outrage from both Democrats and Republicans, who expressed concern about possible environmental damage and negative effects on tourism. Days after the proposal's release, Zinke traveled to Florida and announced that on the recommendation of Gov. Rick Scott ― a staunch Trump supporter ― he was removing the state's coastal waters from consideration. Zinke walked back Florida's exemption after other states demanded that they receive the same pass. He has since hinted to officials from at least six states that the waters off their coasts will not be included in the final plan, Reuters reported this week.	False

Can you imagine the misery and consternation and horror this is going to cause in the corrupt, rancid, rent-seeking world of the Climate Industrial Complex?I can. It will look something like this. Just to be clear, so the greenies can't bleat about being misrepresented, here is what these various papers say:Modern temperatures, sea levels, and extreme weather events are neither unusual nor unprecedented.  Many regions of the Earth are cooler now than they have been for most of the last 10,000 years. Natural factors such as the Sun (106 papers), multi-decadal oceanic-atmospheric oscillations such as the NAO, AMO/PDO, ENSO (37 papers), decadal-scale cloud cover variations, and internal variability in general have exerted a significant influence on weather and climate changes during both the past and present.  Detecting a clear anthropogenic forcing signal amidst the noise of unforced natural variability may therefore be difficult. And current emissions-mitigation policies, especially related to the advocacy for renewables, are often costly, ineffective, and perhaps even harmful to the environment.  On the other hand, elevated CO2 and a warmer climate provide unheralded benefits to the biosphere (i.e., a greener planet and enhanced crop yields). In other words, nobody is denying that climate changes, nobody is denying that the planet has warmed by 0.8 degrees C in the last 150 years, while only a handful deny that carbon dioxide (and other greenhouse gases) has the power to influence temperatures. What they are saying in their different ways is that "global warming" – as in the big scare story that the planet is heating up at a catastrophic unprecedented rate because of man-made CO2 emissions – is bunk; or that the methods being used to combat the problem are bunk.

This Answer Gives a Major Hint at What It Will Look Like This story was originally published by Grist and appears here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. More than 1,000 people crowded into the Showbox, a music venue in downtown Seattle, on Tuesday afternoon to witness Pete Buttigieg make an appearance in the Emerald City. The presidential candidate was running more than 45 minutes late and was just beginning to lose his audience—"I'm starting not to love Pete so much," someone remarked—when he took the stage. The mayor of South Bend, Indiana, has risen swiftly in the polls and managed to outraise the rest of the Democratic field this quarter. Buttigieg has credited climate change for inspiring him to jump into the presidential race. "One of the reasons I'm running for president is because America is running out of time," he said on Tuesday, framing the issue as a national security threat: "If we're gonna get real about national security, the time has come to treat climate disruption as the threat that it is." But Buttigieg hasn't yet released a climate plan on par with those proposed by some of his rivals, including Washington Governor Jay Inslee, who aims to mobilize $9 trillion to combat the crisis and has based his entire presidential bid on the issue. Senator Elizabeth Warren, former Texas Representative Beto O'Rourke, and even Joe Biden, the candidate-to-beat according to most polls, have proposed sweeping climate plans with trillions of dollars at play. Mayor Pete has released one climate-related policy proposal so far, a climate corps — similar to AmeriCorps—that would put thousands of Americans to work on climate resilience and conservation endeavors. "We do better when we have a project," he said of his proposal at the Seattle event. But where does Buttigieg stand when it comes to implementing an economy-wide plan?Buttigieg's answer to a question from the crowd shed light on what his climate plan could look like when (or if) he releases one. First: A carbon tax and dividend. "This is not about taking money out of the economy," he said. "I propose that we rebate that money right back out to the American people and we do it progressively." His pitch sounds like a revenue-neutral carbon tax, a fee on pollution that gets returned to taxpayers every year instead of going toward a climate resiliency fund or a green project. We'll have to wait for his actual plan to figure out what he means when he says he wants to do it "progressively." It's an idea that has failed at the ballot-box twice in Washington state, but a couple of other candidates, including Inslee and Cory Booker, have also championed some kind of carbon tax. Next, "massively increase the amount of federal R&D that goes into not just renewable energy but also energy storage and carbon storage," he said, adding that this investment should be on par with the moon landing or the Manhattan Project. Every candidate with a climate plan so far has vowed to dedicate major resources to green research and development. Buttigieg said he wants to quadruple federal funding for R&D. Then, rejoin the Paris Agreement—something that all the Democrats running for president have said they'll do—and host a stateside Pittsburgh Summit for mayors who are championing green policies and targets in their cities. "A lot of the answers are coming from the communities," he said. Finally, Buttigieg emphasized the role rural America can play in mitigating the crisis. "Every part of the American spectrum needs to be a part of the solution; it's not just cities," he said. Buttigieg said earlier in the night that science sets the timeline for climate action, not politics. But even if he took the White House in 2020, a carbon tax, some more federal investment in R&D, a national service corps, and yet another climate summit probably won't put the United States on the path to decarbonization at the pace that science demands. At any rate, it still doesn't have the same meat as the trillions promised and plans proposed by other candidates. Nevertheless, some audience members were impressed by Buttigieg's vision of a green America. Nancy Lauterbach, a 57-year-old real estate agent, said Buttigieg is "savvy enough to put the R&D that is needed into climate change." Ken Miller, a 71-year-old who owns a construction business, liked the mayor's authenticity. "I thought his point that the timeline is set by science, not by politics, was compelling," Miller said. "As well as the fact that we as a country need a project, and climate change is as good a one as we'll ever have."	True

Last week week, a routine entry in the searchable database at the website of the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources indicated that the Dakota Access Pipeline saw an 84-gallon crude-oil spill in April. The environmental Left rushed to publicize the incident as an "I told you so" moment, but activists' gloating reveals either their cynical dishonesty or their ignorance about how modern pipelines work. The spill occurred in an Energy Transfer Partners facility specifically equipped to catch spills. Moreover, the precautions in place to prevent environmental damage worked exactly as they should, according to the South Dakota Department of Environment and National Resources." s spills go, this spill was contained, all product was cleaned up quickly, and there were no impacts to the environment," Kim Smith, a spokesperson for the South Dakota department, told me. "The containment system and notification system worked as they should." Compare that to the hysterical reaction from leftist activists and their media allies. Writing in the Guardian, opinionist Julian Brave NoiseCat said that the leak "demonstrates the risk of technological and human failure inherent in crude oil pipelines," adding that "indigenous communities, ranchers, and workers [are] forced to live under the constant threat of petroleum poisoning." Jan Hasselman, a lawyer for the Standing Rock Sioux, told the Huffington Post: "They keep telling everybody that it is state of the art, that leaks won't happen, that nothing can go wrong. It's always been false. They haven't even turned the thing on, and it's shown to be false." And a Clean Technica reporter claimed the incident "drives home an essential truth about all the systems mankind has devised to transport oil from place to place," adding: "They all leak. Somewhere, somehow, the vile stuff gets out and when it does, it causes untold damage to the environment." Such biased narratives have bedeviled the Dakota Access Pipeline from the beginning. National media readily adopted opponents' preferred rhetoric in articles, calling demonstrators the "water protectors" and repeating their claims that the protests were "peaceful and prayerful." In actuality, the protests were anything but peaceful, as we reported at the time. Local authorities struggled to respond as demonstrators resorted to violence and vandalism. Protestors reportedly threw Molotov cocktails and stones at law enforcement, also threatening police and their families and posting their home addresses online. Local ranchers said protestors trespassed on their land and damaged their property. By the time the protests ended, hundreds had been arrested. These facts received little coverage, the media instead portraying a David-and-Goliath fight in which virtuous protesters took on a corrupt, wealthy industry. And while the Left likes to accuse conservatives of being anti-science, it has ignored any evidence that doesn't support its anti-pipeline agenda. Comprehensive environmental reviews, conducted under the Obama administration, showed the risk posed by Keystone XL and the Dakota Access Pipeline to be minimal. But some of the same environmentalists who denounced Trump for moving ahead with the pipelines also rushed to participate in the March for Science. Green activists have also spent the last year publicizing scary statistics about oil pipelines. But just as with the recent Dakota Access Pipeline spill, the reality is less convenient for their political preferences. Cutting-edge technology such as the containment system installed at the pump station in Tulare, S.D., means that it's safer than ever to transport oil by pipeline. The Fraser Institute, a Canadian free-market think tank, analyzed U.S. State Department data, finding that 70 percent of spills that have occurred in North America were a cubic meter or less — hardly the massive leakage environmentalists have implied. Moreover, the Fraser Institute found that only 17 percent of spills take place along the pipeline's route, the rest occurring in facilities such as the Tulare pump station, which are specially equipped to safely handle spills and avoid environmental contamination. Overall, the number of pipeline incidents in which people or the environment were harmed has dropped by more than 50 percent since 1999 — even as the United States saw its energy production skyrocket. The outcome of the Dakota Access Pipeline spill was a technological triumph that should reassure its skeptics. The pipeline's opponents are trying to spin it into a cautionary tale. In doing so, they reveal their own selective adherence to scientific reason.— Jillian Kay Melchior is a fellow at the Independent Women's Forum.	False

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently suggested Miami would disappear in "a few years" due to climate change. The United Nations is convening a "Climate Action Summit" next week. And climate activist Greta Thunberg is on Capitol Hill this week telling lawmakers they must act soon. But while data from NASA and other top research agencies confirms global temperatures are indeed rising, a newly compiled retrospective indicates the doomsday rhetoric is perhaps more overheated. NYC SAYS 1.1M STUDENTS CAN ATTEND CLIMATE STRIKE PROTEST WITHOUT PUNISHMENTThe conservative-leaning Competitive Enterprise Institute has put together a lengthy compilation of apocalyptic predictions dating back decades that did not come to pass, timed as Democratic presidential candidates and climate activists refocus attention on the issue. The dire predictions, often repeated in the media, warned of a variety of impending disasters – famine, drought, an ice age, and even disappearing nations – if the world failed to act on climate change. An Associated Press headline from 1989 read "Rising seas could obliterate nations: U.N. officials." The article detailed a U.N. environmental official warning that entire nations would be eliminated if the world failed to reverse warming by 2000. Then there were the fears that the world would experience a never-ending "cooling trend in the Northern Hemisphere." That claim came from an "international team of specialists" cited by The New York Times in 1978. Just years prior, Time magazine echoed other media outlets in suggesting that "another ice age" was imminent. "Telltale signs are everywhere — from the unexpected persistence and thickness of pack ice in the waters around Iceland to the southward migration of a warmth-loving creature like the armadillo from the Midwest," the magazine warned in 1974. The Guardian similarly warned in 1974 that "Space satellites show new Ice Age coming fast." In 1970, The Boston Globe ran the headline, "Scientist predicts a new ice age by 21st century." The Washington Post, for its part, published a Columbia University scientist's claim that the world could be "as little as 50 or 60 years away from a disastrous new ice age." Some of the more dire predictions came from Paul Ehrlich, a biologist who famously urged population control to mitigate the impacts of humans on the environment. Ehrlich, in 1969, warned that "everybody" would "disappear in a cloud of blue steam in 20 years," The New York Times reported. According to The Salt Lake Tribune, Ehrlich, warning of a "disastrous" famine," urged placing "sterilizing agents into staple foods and drinking water." ANDY PUZDER: HERE'S WHY DEMS WANT TO GENERATE CLIMATE PANIC (AS THEY IGNORE WAYS TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS)Those predictions were made around the time former President Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency. Since then, the U.S. has adopted a series of environmental reforms aimed at limiting emissions. Years after those initial predictions, media outlets and politicians continue to teem with claims of apocalyptic scenarios resulting from climate change. Earlier this month, leading Democratic presidential candidates held a town hall on the issue and warned about the "existential" threat posed by a changing climate. Before the end of the month, 2020 candidates are expected to have another climate forum at Georgetown University. CEI's report came just before the U.N. Climate Action Summit on Sept. 23, an event that promises to "spark the transformation that is urgently needed and propel action that will benefit everyone." It also came a week after Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., warned that Miami would be gone in a "few years" because of climate change. She was responding to critics of her ambitious "Green New Deal," which seeks to reach net-zero emissions within just decades. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPOcasio-Cortez, whose plan has been endorsed by leading presidential candidates, previously joked that the world would end in 12 years if it didn't address climate change. But short-term predictions weren't a laughing matter in the years following "An Inconvenient Truth," a documentary produced by former Vice President Al Gore. In 2008, ABC released an ominous video about what the world would look like in 2015. As the video warned about rising sea levels, a graphic showed significant portions of New York City engulfed by water. Gore himself famously predicted in the early 2000s that Arctic ice could be gone within seven years. At the end of seven years, Arctic ice had undergone a period of expansion, though recently it has been melting at a quicker pace.	False

But in Washington the snowball metaphor might more accurately describe how a markedly different brand of climate politics is gaining support. By Wednesday, the burgeoning effort to establish a select committee in the House of Representatives on a Green New Deal ― essentially a plan to make a plan ― picked up its strongest endorsements yet, netting support from the co-chairs of the 78-member Congressional Progressive Caucus and from the first labor union to back the proposal. At least 35 incoming or sitting House members support the resolution, as do four senators. The proposal, championed by Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), came as grassroots groups like the Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats organized protests at the Capitol, with young activists occupying Democratic leaders' offices and urging lawmakers to pledge their support. Nearly 150 people were arrested Monday in the groups' largest demonstration yet. The resolution faced skepticism from the top Democrats on natural resources and energy committees that wield legislative power over the issues a Green New Deal would cover. But proponents tweaked language in the proposal this week to mandate the select committee to lay out a vision for a Green New Deal while maintaining existing committees' authority over the lawmaking process."  wouldn't even call it compromises.

The unusually speedy sausagemaking process inverts decades of Democrats' dithering on the rapidly worsening crisis caused by greenhouse gas pollution.

In the meantime, the administration has worked hard to further undercut the talks.

Trump also said at last month's G7 meeting that "I'm an environmentalist," citing his experience filing environmental impact statements as a businessperson, though he skipped an actual session about climate change that his fellow world leaders attended. That pretty much sums up the difference between how a Democrat would treat climate change compared with Trump: as an emergency as opposed to as a joke. That, in itself, would be an enormous switch. This is a worldwide issue, and solving it will take cooperation from countries like China and India. In addition, the most important actions the US could take would require congressional approval, no easy task when the Senate floor is controlled by a Republican who represents coal country. But presidents actually have quite a bit of power to change US climate policy on their own, without waiting for Congress.A first set of steps would be to roll back numerous Trump actions that either sidelined US leadership on the climate or rescinded new standards that had been implemented during the Obama administration. CNN gathered input from advocacy groups, former government officials and academics. Here are some things any president could do on Day One in office:climate agreement was Promising to withdraw the US from the landmark 2015climate agreement was Trump's benchmark action rebutting the responsibility to act on climate change . He said, without much evidence, that it was a demeaning failure for American workers, who would be expected to do more than those in other countries. The result is the US is one of just a few countries not taking part in the effort, in which nations committed to varying amounts of carbon reduction. Every candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination has said they would bring the US back in. The US was supposed to reduce carbon emissions by 26% from 2005 levels by 2025 under the agreement. It probably won't get there with the willful sabotage of the Trump administration. But with certain states, cities and companies trying to fill the void, the US could get most of the way there, according to groups like America's Pledge, the coalition pushed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former California Gov. Jerry Brown. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont was the first presidential candidate to argue that Trump, instead of declaring a national emergency at the border, should do it on the climate instead. Others, like Tom Steyer, have followed suit. This would certainly focus national attention and could free up some funds without congressional approval. The President could easily declare a goal of 100% decarbonization by a given year -- say, 2050 -- and direct his or her Cabinet secretaries to do everything in their power to meet it. At the request of automakers, the Trump administration worked to roll back fuel economy standards for cars and trucks. A different President could push things again in the other direction.5. Set a zero-emission deadline for the USThe Clean Power Plan was an Obama-era regulatory scheme that required states to meet specific carbon emission-reduction standards based on their individual energy consumption. The plan includes an incentive program for states to get a head start on meeting standards on early deployment of renewable energy and low-income energy efficiency.8. Reverse Trump's plan to speed up oil and gas pipelinesWorkers in the Bureau of Land Management worked through the partial government shutdown early this year to approve more and more applications for oil and natural gas drilling on public lands. A new administration could move in the opposite direction.13. Use the SEC to scrutinize banks and investors for climate risksMost attention for climate change goes to the energy sector, but banks and investors have an important role too. The Securities and Exchange Commission asks companies what risks climate change and new climate change regulations pose to their investments.14. Tap into growing public sentiment and work with corporationsStates and cities are addressing climate change, be it with zero-emission-vehicle goals or the regional cooperative of states in the Northeast that is trying to cap and reduce carbon emissions on its own. Corporate America is also moving on its own. It's setting up coalitions of companies and lobbying Congress for new action on climate change. As it stands right now, the federal government is not even a part of that conversation. Pretty much everyone who agrees that climate change is a problem agrees that Congress will ultimately have to address it in a big way. That means placing some kind of price on carbon. The House voted to do this in 2010, but the so-called cap-and-trade proposal didn't get a vote in the Senate and then Democrats lost control of the House for eight years.	True

But in January, the agency put out new "extreme" sea level projections — its doomsday scenario, in other words.	So what would a 10-foot rise in sea levels mean for Florida?	Rising sea levels are causing more frequent and more damaging tidal floods on the Florida coast, and projections suggest that the risk to lives and property from climate change-related flooding events is only going to increase dramatically in the coming years.		Trump doesn't believe in climate change, but it's going to drown Mar-a-Lago President Donald Trump has called climate change a "hoax" and a very expensive "tax" on American businesses that make the US less competitive. He has threatened to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord, in which countries around the world pledged to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to keep temperatures from rising past the critical 2°C mark. And yet climate change is already imperiling Mar-a-Lago, the crown jewel of Trump's extensive real estate portfolio and his preferred location for carrying out many of his official presidential duties. Rising sea levels are causing more frequent and more damaging tidal floods on the Florida coast, and projections suggest that the risk to lives and property from climate change-related flooding events is only going to increase dramatically in the coming years. The National and Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has put out a variety of different estimates of rising sea levels in Southern Florida. The more conservative finding suggests that they could jump anywhere from 3 feet by 2050 to 7 feet by 2100. But in January, the agency put out new "extreme" sea level projections — its doomsday scenario, in other words. In this scenario, we'd see a 10- to 12-foot rise in sea level in the US by 2100, which would have dramatic consequences for places like Mar-a-Lago, as you can see in the photo above. So what would a 10-foot rise in sea levels mean for Florida? Here's a satellite image of what that would look like. Large swaths of the state are submerged. Miami is entirely flooded, along with the rest of Southern Florida:There is evidence that average sea levels are already steadily rising in Southern Florida. A 2016 paper found that in the past decade, the average rate of sea-level rise had tripled from 3 millimeters a year to 9 millimeters. And overall sea levels in Southern Florida had risen about 90 millimeters, or 3.5 inches, since 2006. Of the 30 most populous US cities that would be negatively affected by extreme sea-level rise, Climate Central, a nonprofit climate science research group, found that 19 were located in Florida (circled in yellow in the chart below). Scientists don't have a great understanding of how exactly rapidly sea levels will continue to rise or the precise impact on specific areas. But new research that indicates parts of the Antarctic ice sheet may collapse in the next 100 years — and that has scientists scrambling to model more extreme scenarios. If the Antarctic ice sheet does melt, it could trigger a catastrophic 10-foot spike in sea levels and inundate major US cities like New York and Miami, displacing nearly 150 million people worldwide." t may be a lot less stable [in Antarctica] than we thought," said Ben Strauss, a vice president at Climate Central. "But the truth is we are relatively early in our scientific understanding of how the great ice sheets will respond to warming." Last summer, the Guardian investigated Trump's coastal properties to see how at risk each of them were to flooding from rising sea levels. What they found was Mar-a-Lago was already in serious trouble. The estate was at high risk for flooding during heavy rains and storms, with water already pooling on the premises in addition to nearby bridges and roads in Palm Beach. Plus, in the next 30 years, they estimated there will be 210 days a year where Mar-a-Lago will be flooded with at least a foot of water. Keren Bolter, chief scientist for Coastal Risk Consulting and the firm that analyzed Trump's properties, told the Guardian that tidal flooding in the next 30 years could partially submerge some of the club's luxurious cottages and bungalows. And perhaps even eventually render Trump's "Southern White House" uninhabitable.	False

The largest increase that year came from China. According to a report released by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) last year, the U.S. reduced its greenhouse gas output by 2.7 percent during President Trump's first year in office." hanks to President Trump's regulatory reform agenda, the economy is booming, energy production is surging, and we are reducing greenhouse gas emissions from major industrial sources," EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said at the time." hese achievements flow largely from technological breakthroughs in the private sector, not the heavy hand of government.

Known as the Green New Deal, this economic stimulus package for the planet promises to dramatically cut carbon emissions through government spending on clean energy jobs, technologies, and infrastructure. The main selling point of the Green New Deal has been its politics. While carbon pricing has long been touted as the most cost effective policy for reducing emissions, it has struggled to gain legislative traction. By contrast, advocates of the Green New Deal believe their proposal can build a winning coalition by reframing climate policy as a story of economic growth and opportunity.A Green New Deal is not just good politics. It is good economics. Society can combat climate change by using existing clean technologies to cut emissions today or by innovating new clean technologies to cut emissions in the future. We need both strategies to address global warming. Every second that we delay in reducing our carbon footprint imposes costs on ourselves and on countless future generations. If we want to avoid climate catastrophe, we need to make deep cuts in emissions soon. On the other hand, the challenges and costs of relying solely on current technologies to address climate change are prohibitively high. We need investments in clean innovation to make it cheaper to reduce emissions in the future. We could achieve the twin goals of slashing emissions and spurring innovation by putting a very high price on greenhouse gases. Carbon taxes can encourage industries to both reduce their footprints and develop cheaper clean technologies. However, carbon pricing by itself is not the most efficient climate policy. As we explain in a recent paper, the cheaper and faster approach for our society is to combine a moderately sized carbon tax with significant federal spending on the development and deployment of clean technologies. While carbon pricing is the most cost effective way to reduce emissions today, government subsidies are the most cost effective way to advance clean technologies tomorrow. The intuition behind all this is simple. Policies work best when they are narrowly tailored to the behavior that they seek to alter. Thus, if we want markets to produce more clean innovation, we should reward innovators rather than penalize polluters in the hopes that doing so will indirectly induce them to produce innovation. The benefits of directly encouraging clean innovation are striking. Economists have estimated our society can save more than $1.4 trillion a year if governments used a combination of taxes and subsidies, rather than taxes only, to address climate change. In short, good economics calls for the type of broad federal spending on clean innovation that the Green New Deal promises to deliver. Of course, the effectiveness of the proposal at spurring innovation will depend on its design, the exact details of which have yet to be ironed out. The package should increase funding for early stage clean energy research, as this kind of basic science is usually too risky to attract private investors. The Green New Deal should also include subsidies for the adoption and deployment of clean technologies, such as tax credits for clean energy investment and manufacturing. These types of policies that help emerging technologies scale up and mature can be powerful drivers of clean energy innovation. Critics will undoubtedly argue that we cannot afford the Green New Deal. This line of attack, however, ignores the costs of inaction. While the Green New Deal will not be cheap, its price pales in comparison to the damage that unchecked climate change will inflict on the economy. This argument also ignores the savings that will result from the push toward clean energy innovation under the Green New Deal. The development of cheaper clean technologies should more than offset the costs of the stimulus package. Opponents will also claim that the government is a bad venture capitalist, and that a Green New Deal will pour taxpayer dollars into clean energy boondoggles. While concerns about government waste are certainly real, they can be avoided through smart policy design. The government can encourage innovation without favoring particular clean technologies or companies by enacting neutral research and development tax credits. The ideal economic climate policy does include carbon pricing. But we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Even if the government cannot enact the best policy for cutting emissions today, it can still use the best policy for advancing clean innovation tomorrow. The Green New Deal pushes climate policy into uncharted political waters, but it does so based on sound economic theories. If we want to save the planet for the least amount of money, we need the Green New Deal, and we need it now. Quentin Karpilow is a law clerk in the federal judiciary.

Protesters disrupt US panel's fossil fuels pitch at climate talks A Trump administration presentation extolling the virtues of fossil fuels at the UN climate talks in Poland has been met with guffaws of laughter and chants of "Shame on you". Monday's protest came during a panel discussion by the official US delegation, which used its only public appearance to promote the "unapologetic utilisation" of coal, oil and gas. Although these industries are the main source of the carbon emissions that are causing global warming, the speakers boasted the US would expand production for the sake of global energy security and planned a new fleet of coal plants with technology it hoped to export to other countries. The event featured prominent cheerleaders for fossil fuels and nuclear power, including Wells Griffith, Donald Trump's adviser on global energy and climate, Steve Winberg, the assistant secretary for fossil energy at the energy department, and Rich Powell, the executive director of the ClearPath Foundation, a non-profit organisation focused on "conservative clean energy". The only non-American was Patrick Suckling, the ambassador for the environment in Australia's coal-enthusiast government. None of the US participants mentioned climate change or global warming, focusing instead of "innovation and entrepreneurship" in the technological development of nuclear power, "clean coal" and carbon capture and storage. Ten minutes into Griffith's opening speech, he was interrupted by a sudden, sustained, loud volley of laughter by several dozen protesters that was then followed by a single shout of "It's not funny", and then a series of chants of "Keep it in the ground" and "Shame on you". Several campaigners read statements. "There is no such thing as clean coal. Coal is deadly from the beginning to the end. They talk about the life cycle of coal, I talk about it as a death march. My father died of black lung, and I am in this struggle with others whose fathers and husbands are dying of black lung right now," said Teri Blanton of Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, which represents Appalachian coal workers in North America. After the protesters were led away by security guards, Griffiths said: "In the US our policy is not to keep it in the ground, but to use it as cleanly and efficiently as possible". This statement was contradicted by climate analysts, who noted the US environment agency estimates that 1,400 more deaths per year will result from Trump's proposal to replace the Clean Power Act." t's ludicrous for Trump officials to claim that they want to clean up fossil fuels, while dismantling standards that would do just that," said Dan Lashof, the director of the World Resources Institute. "Since taking office, this administration has proposed to roll back measures to cut methane leaks from oil and gas operations, made it easier for companies to dump coal ash into drinking water, and just days ago proposed easing carbon pollution rules for new coal-fired power plants." Griffith boasted the US had the largest coal reserves in the world and iwas producing more petroleum than ever. "To achieve economic growth and eradicate poverty, all energy uses are important and they will be utilised unapologetically," he said. Echoing a claim often made by Trump, Griffiths said the US would not be subject to agreements that hamstrung domestic growth, while allowing China to operate with high emissions. This was the second consecutive year that the Trump team was heckled after promoting fossil fuels and nuclear power at the climate talks, underscoring how the US position has shifted since the president took power in 2017. The US was a key player in forging the Paris agreement in 2015, but its standing has steadily eroded since. In 2017, Trump announced he would pull the US out of the global accord. This year, his representatives have taken a still more destructive stance by aligning with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to try to downgrade a key report by the world's scientists that warned of the dangers of global warming moving beyond 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. None of the panelists would be drawn on the study, but Griffith spoke out against "alarmism" that, he claimed, displaced pragmatic solutions to address environmental concerns with prescriptive regulations that put jobs at risk and raised costs for consumers. In fact, scientists say their forecasts about climate impacts have been too conservative, while economists say the shift to renewables has resulted in cheaper energy for many users. Winberg said the US government was planning to support a new fleet of small, modular coal plants that he claimed would be energy-efficient and have near-zero emissions if combined with carbon capture technology. After initial development in the US, he said they could be exported to other countries. "They offer opportunity for developing nations to access tomorrow's coal technology to improve energy security," he said. He also proposed more pipelines to oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite this public commitment, the US use of coal is declining because renewables are cheaper, according to Nathaniel Keohane, the senior vice-president for the Environmental Defense Fund nonprofit group." rump is playing politics, but it's not changing the facts on the ground," he said. "Coal usage in the US just hit a 39-year low. If we really want to protect our economy, we'll move aggressively toward 100% clean energy." An alternative, non-official US delegation has backed a faster transition to renewables. Made up of city- and state-level governments, business executives and religious leaders, the "We're still in" group is staging dozens of events in a bid to show action is still possible without White House support. Nonetheless, many observers at the official US panel were ashamed at the position of their federal government. "I was completely embarrassed to be an American", said Leo McNeil Woodberry of the Climate Action Network. "Everything they proposed was absolutely wrong. I can't believe they are putting profits over the planet, and profits over people."	False

West Virginia loves coal, and coal miners love Trump, but what both of them may not love is the fact that a reduction in pollution controls is going to greatly increase the number of people who die prematurely from pollution created by burning coal. It will also greatly increase the number of people who get sick with serious illnesses such as heart and lung problems. When he made his announcement somehow Trump left out those details of the life-threatening side-effects of using coal to create electrical energy. Even though they will be getting sick and dying at higher rates, it is not expected that Trump's actions will reduce his popularity among West Virginians. An analysis done by his own Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concludes that the rollback of Obama-era pollution controls will lead to many more people dying and suffering health problems that they otherwise would not have. Clean-air controls since the 1980's stopped the columns of black soot that used to rise from coal smokestacks in the region. The clean air rules reduced the number of people dying from coal-fired power plants substantially. Technology has changed, and now pollutants rise from smokestacks as gases before solidifying into invisible particles small enough to pass through lungs and into bloodstreams. An EPA analysis says those pollutants would increase under Trump's plan, when compared to what would happen under the Obama rules. This will result in many thousands of more heart attacks, asthma problems and other illnesses than would have happened without Trump's new rules. The EPA says up to 1,500 more people will die each year under Trump's plan. And the areas that will be hit the hardest are in Trump country — the coal mining regions of West Virginia. There could be dozens of new deaths and hundreds of new serious illnesses each year because of Trump's plan. Obama's Clean Power Plan targeted climate-changing carbon dioxide and would have curbed harmful emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants from the coal-fired power plants. It would have increased federal regulation of emissions from the nation's electrical grid and broadly promoted natural gas, solar power and other cleaner energy. Trump's Affordable Clean Energy program will dismantle President Barack Obama's 2015 Clean Power Plan which has not yet been implemented due to court battles. Trump's plan will give up much of the federal oversight of existing coal-fired power plants. Not only that, but the government will no longer promote cleaner energy. Individual states will decide how much to regulate coal power plants in their own states. At his public announcement Trump said "I'm getting rid of some of these ridiculous rules and regulations, which are killing our companies … and our jobs." There was no mention of the increases in harmful emissions that would result, compared to the Obama plan, or the health risks. In West Virginia, coal is popular, and politicians who support coal get elected. Vivian Stockman of the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition was protesting outside Trump's rally." ur state is beholden to coal. Our politicians are beholden to coal. Meanwhile, our people are being poisoned," she said.	False

Climate change is real.		Trump's EPA chief dismisses climate study, then admits he hasn't read it Trump's recently installed EPA chief dismissed a study from his own department's scientists about the dangers of climate change — and then admitted he never even read the study in the first place. The study, produced by EPA scientists and published in the journal Nature Climate Change, concluded that climate change will affect 22 major sectors in the United States, including human health, infrastructure, and agriculture — and that the damages in some sectors are "estimated to range in the hundreds of billions of US dollars annually by the end of the century" if we do nothing and allow carbon emissions to remain high. But EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler — a former coal lobbyist and a pro-pollution apologist — doesn't care." Just because our scientists publish something in a journal doesn't mean that that's agency policy or all the other scientists at the agency agree with that particular study," Wheeler told Reuters. But Wheeler's quick dismissal of the report was followed up by an admission that he had no idea what it actually said."I have not read that article, I just saw a news a clip about it, but I haven't read it and I haven't talked to the scientist that wrote it," Wheeler said. Wheeler was appointed to head the EPA after Trump's first scandal-plagued EPA chief, Scott Pruitt, was ousted. And Wheeler's approach — ignoring science in favor of industry and pollution — is a perfect reflection of Trump's shameful approach to climate issues. The administration and its officials regularly disregard the scientific consensus about the harms of climate change in order to justify rolling back regulations and trashing initiatives designed to make the world cleaner and safer. Trump himself once infamously promoted the false conspiracy theory that climate change is a hoax from the Chinese government. Currently, Trump is trying to create a senior-level government panel that would oppose the scientific facts of climate change and instead promote baseless propaganda from pro-pollution crackpots. Most U.S. government agencies are refusing to participate in the project. However, Trump is still receiving plenty of help from congressional Republicans who refuse to take the climate crisis seriously. Senate Republicans have relentlessly made false and disingenuous attacks on the Green New Deal, a sweeping Democratic proposal to help stop climate change before it's too late while also creating jobs and protecting vulnerable communities. And in the House, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) made a viral fool of himself by attacking former Secretary of State John Kerry after he tried to raise concerns about how climate change would harm national security. Climate change is real. It is a threat to America and to all of humanity. But Trump and his fellow Republicans refuse to acknowledge reality — and they certainly can't be bothered to read scientific reports about it. Published with permission of The American Independent.

Trump's Confusion Machine As international leaders gathered in New York for this week's meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, they got another taste of the Trump Administration's leadership style. It can be summed up in one word: confusion. Sometimes it appears to be a result of ineptitude; other times it appears to be tactical. Then came the election of Donald Trump. After months of intrigue about what he might do, Trump announced in June that the United States plans to withdraw from the accord "unless we can re-enter on terms that are more favorable to our country." It seemed that Trump left the door open to reversing his decision. Recent events have offered a good opportunity for Trump to do so. Steve Bannon, the senior advisor who reportedly pressed Trump to withdraw from the accord, has left the White House. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma showed with unprecedented fury that global warming is putting Americans in greater jeopardy by making storms more destructive. And the current convergence of world leaders on New York gives them another opportunity to lobby Trump to reverse his position. As last weekend began, the Wall Street Journal reported "The Trump administration is considering staying in the Paris agreement to fight climate change 'under the right conditions,' offering to re-engage in the international deal…" The White House shot down the story by responding that the president's intentions have not changed. It was the latest example of the bewilderment Trump has created about whether or not the world's second biggest source of climate-altering pollution plans to do anything about it. First, with his seemingly provisional withdrawal decision last June, Trump used one of his deal-making gambits. He announced an extreme position but hinted he was willing to negotiate. In reality, there is no deal to be made and no interest among other nations to reopen an agreement that took the world 20 years to achieve. It appears that Trump's real purpose was to please his base while blunting criticism with the hint that he might change his mind. Second, it is clear even now that Trump and his people do not understand the Paris accord. They seem not to have read it. It calls for voluntary commitments from nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. If Trump feels the climate action plan President Obama submitted under the Paris accord was somehow disadvantageous to the country, he could simply submit a new plan. Instead, Trump hopes to show that he is standing up to the world community on behalf of America's interests. Tillerson exhibited his lack of understanding when he said Sunday, "if you look at those targets and terms of the Paris climate accord, they were just really out of balance for the two largest economies." He presumably was talking about China and the United States, who are also the world's two largest carbon polluters. However, the commitments that China and the United States submitted under the Paris accord reflected a historic bilateral agreement that the two nations announced in November 2014. On Sept. 3, 2016, President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China jointly reaffirmed their commitments to the Paris deal "offering a rare display of harmony," as the New York Times put it. So, Tillerson's perception that the Paris accord is not good for China or the United States was not shared by the two nation's leaders. Nor, I assume, is it shared by the hundreds of businesses and investors who urged Trump to remain in the pact. Other history contradicts the idea that the United States signed onto an "out of balance" deal. In 1997, most nations signed the Kyoto Protocol, an agreement under which developed but not developing nations committed to reduce their carbon pollution. The premise was that the industrial economies were most responsible for the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and that developing countries needed to continue using fossil fuels for the immediate future to grow their economies. The U.S. Senate, whose "advice and consent" was necessary before President Clinton could ratify the Protocol, signaled that it would not concur. It approved a resolution saying that it would not consent to any agreement that did not also include greenhouse gas reductions by developing nations. As a result, President Clinton did not bother to submit the Protocol to the Senate and in March 2001, President Bush announced officially that the U.S. would not participate. Third, Trump's conditional willingness to reengage in international climate action is belied by the fact that he has laid waste to the federal government's ability to influence America's carbon pollution. The United States would return to the table with little or nothing to offer in regard to our own substantial emissions.	False

Bakersfield, Calif., was in second place for ozone pollution. Other California cities on the list include Fresno, Sacramento and San Diego.

Climate remains a low priority for most voters. Just 38 percent of registered voters said candidates' positions on global warming would be "very important" to their voting decisions, according to a Yale Program On Climate Change Communication survey published in May. Rising temperatures ranked 15th of 28 issues voters ranked in the questionnaire. In the lead up to the 2018 midterm elections, the fossil fuel industry spent $100 million to crush pro-climate ballot measures across the West, and to prop up candidates who supported increased oil and gas extraction. Yet that base of climate hawks helped elect a cadre of Democrats whose urgent visions for climate action earned plaudits from a spectrum ranging from mainstream environmental groups to so-called eco-socialists. And a new majority of Democratic state attorneys general are facing growing pressure to file lawsuits over climate damages.

"I hope he pushes for a Green New Deal and helps really add fuel to the fire that's been lit under politicians and the public over the past week." Sanders stopped short of endorsing the Green New Deal. But in April 2017, he co-sponsored legislation to move the United States to 100-percent clean energy by 2050. The bill included $7 billion in targeted infrastructure and environmental investments in fossil-fuel communities, and called for union labor protections for workers on federally backed green jobs. In November 2017, Sanders introduced a bill to spend $146 billion rebuilding storm-ravaged Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with renewable energy. Seventy-one percent of major, televised debates in the 2018 midterm elections ignored the issue completely. Only four of the 107 segments ABC, CBS and NBC aired from Nov. 8 to Nov. 13 on the deadly wildfires scorching California this month discussed climate change.

Top Trump Cabinet Pick Went On 'Fox News Sunday' – It Was A Disaster (VIDEO) Last month, during an episode of CNBC's Squawk Box, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said that he did not consider carbon emissions to be a "primary contributor" to global warming. Pruitt was pretty steadfast in his position then; however, on Sunday, he was forced to entertain the possibility that he might be wrong during an interview with Fox News's Chris Wallace. After referencing Pruitt's statement from last month, Wallace said that there are "all kinds of studies" that contradict him. The Fox News Sunday anchor went on to reference a report from the U.N. that says it is 95 percent likely that human activity has caused the majority of the warming that has taken place since the mid-20th century. The report also determines that there is "more carbon dioxide now than in the last 400,000 years" and that 2015 and 2016 were the two hottest years on record. After listing this information, Wallace then asked, "Mr. Pruitt, are we supposed to believe that's all a coincidence?"Unable to give a straight answer, Pruitt first admitted that human activity does contribute to the current "warming trend." He then quickly moved on to accusing President Obama of "reimagining authority" with his clean power plan and praised Trump's recent executive order undoing environmental regulations that Obama put in place. Wallace quickly called Pruitt out on his inability to answer the question, saying, "Sir, you're sugar coating what you have said."'You said there that you would not agree that carbon CO2 is a primary contributor to global warming. And the question I have is, what if you're wrong? What if, in fact, the Earth is warming, what if it is causing dramatic climate change and that we as humans through carbon emissions are contributing to it?'Backed into a corner, Pruitt conceded that CO2 does contribute to global warming, although he followed up this concession by saying, "The issue is how much we contribute to it from a human activity perspective and what can be done about it from a process perspective." Wallace responded by asking, "But don't you think the fact that we have these coal power plants belching carbon emissions into the air, you don't think that plays a role?"Realizing that he wasn't going to get anywhere with Pruitt on that particular issue, Wallace switched gears slightly to ask a final question about the Trump administration's proposed cuts to the EPA. Once again, Pruitt took the question as an opportunity to criticize the Obama administration, saying that in the past there has been a "lack of commitment to state partnership." When Wallace asked him if he was sure that the states would pick up the slack, Pruitt said that he had met with several governors who had confirmed that they would. Whether or not that's actually true remains to be seen. Watch the interview below, via YouTube. Featured image is a screenshot from the video.	False

The action keeps alive, at least for now, an unusual lawsuit begun in 2015 to force a change in federal environmental policy by declaring a "climate system capable of sustaining human life" a civil right. The lawsuit was brought on behalf of children now ages 11-22, as well as future generations. But while refusing to halt the trial, the justices indicated that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit could do so if the Justice Department asks. That court has refused to intervene in the past. Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissented, presumably because they were prepared to stop the trial now. The justices had expressed misgivings about the lawsuit in July, when they refused to stop the legal process but said the breadth of the claims was "striking." Whether those claims should be handled in court "presents substantial grounds for difference of opinion," the court said then. Lawyers for Our Children's Trust have argued that government policies have deprived the children of their "constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property, to dignity, to personal security, to a stable climate system capable of sustaining human lives and liberties." They want the government to "prepare an accounting of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions, and prepare and implement an enforceable national remedial plan" for reducing carbon emissions. Federal district court Judge Ann Aiken, who has presided over pretrial briefing for more than two years, had scheduled the trial to begin Monday and last up to 12 weeks." ourts have an obligation not to overstep the bounds of their jurisdiction, but they have an equally important duty to fulfill their role as a check on any unconstitutional actions of the other branches of government," she said last month in denying the government's effort to stall or dismiss the trial.

Its objections were first raised during the Obama administration." his suit is an attempt to redirect federal environmental and energy policies through the courts rather than through the political process, by asserting a new and unsupported fundamental due process right to certain climate conditions," Solicitor General Noel Francisco argued in court papers. The children on whose behalf the lawsuit was filed, he said, "can make no credible claim of imminent, irreparable harm. Their alleged injuries stem from the cumulative effects of CO2 emissions from every source in the world over decades." Although the case, Juliana v.

Is he ok? Biden's eye fills with BLOOD as he defends fossil fuel ties at climate forum (VIDEO) Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden really grabbed the audience's eyes at the climate change town hall – literally, as his eye filled with blood after a lackluster performance marked by half-truths and excuses. The former Vice President was clearly floundering during CNN's climate change town hall on Wednesday, which saw him face off against eight other Democrats. Viewers called him out for "rambling, incoherent" answers and held his feet to the fire regarding his coziness with the fossil fuel industry. Then his left eye began filling up with blood. At around the same time, his campaign cautioned voters not to "turn a blind eye to the way in which environmental burdens are distributed unevenly along racial and socioeconomic lines" – an ironic coincidence, or a sly reference to the unusual anatomic event?Before Biden's eye exploded, the audience had been raking him over the coals for a scheduled fundraiser the following night at the home of a natural gas executive. The three-time candidate has never been particularly committed to "green" issues – slammed by environmental groups for not having a climate change policy, he finally released one in June that contained several plagiarized items. But he had, along with most of the other Democratic candidates, promised not to take money from the fossil fuel industry – a promise the fundraiser seemed to break, to viewers' dismay. But even the most blatant political hypocrisy was no match for the eye. "Look, Biden haters, sometimes your eye is gonna spontaneously fill up with blood, okay," one user joked. "Twitter furiously deploying algorithms to keep Biden's bloody corpse eye from trending," observed another (it appeared to work - while #ClimateTownHall was trending, #BidensBloodyEye and variations thereof were noticeably not). Apparently, it wasn't even the first time Biden's eye has filled up with blood during an important political event. But some commenters found a way to bring the conversation back to the environment. "Not sure after tonight who has less time to live, Biden or the planet," said one. "Joe Biden lied so hard during the climate town hall that his eye started bleeding," commented another. "I give it 14 minutes before Biden's campaign says his bloody eye was because of climate change," predicted another. Meanwhile, others made the inevitable comparisons to Hillary Clinton – another candidate with a marked "enthusiasm gap" between donors and voters, who has run for president and lost before, yet is propped up by the media as the surefire winner. And some took time out from gawking to worry about his health, since political speeches don't normally cause visible injury. "Does Biden have a blood clot in his left eye?" wondered one user. "This can't be good news, given his health history," noted another. Like this story? Share it with a friend!	False

So, here's one solution to the problem: Dairy farmers in Massachusetts are using food waste to create electricity.	His hope is that the concept will spread here.	He says times are tough for dairy farmers, so this gives him a new stream of revenue.	Much of it is generated from prepping prepared foods.		Chew On This: Farmers Are Using Food Waste To Make Electricity Chew On This: Farmers Are Using Food Waste To Make ElectricityThis story was produced as part of a collaboration with the PBS NewsHourAs the season of big holiday meals kicks off, it's as good a time as any to reflect on just how much food goes to waste. If you piled up all the food that's not eaten over the course of a year in the U.S., it would be enough to fill a skyscraper in Chicago about 44 times, according to an estimate from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. And, when all this food rots in a landfill, it emits methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. In fact, a recent report from the United Nations from a panel of climate experts estimates that up to 10 percent of all human-made greenhouse gas emissions are linked to food waste. So, here's one solution to the problem: Dairy farmers in Massachusetts are using food waste to create electricity. They feed waste into anaerobic digesters, built and operated by Vanguard Renewables, which capture the methane emissions and make renewable energy. The process begins by gathering wasted food from around the state, including from many Whole Foods locations. We visited the chain's store in Shrewsbury, Mass., which has installed a Grind2Energy system. It's an industrial-strength grinder that gobbles up all the scraps of food the store can't sell, explains Karen Franczyk, who is the sustainability program manager for Whole Foods' North Atlantic region. The machine will grind up all kinds of food waste — "everything from bones, we put whole fish in here, to vegetables to dry items like rice or grains," Franczyk says as the grinder is loaded. It also takes frying fats and greases. While Whole Foods donates a lot of surplus food to food banks, there's a lot waste left over. Much of it is generated from prepping prepared foods. Just as when you cook in your own kitchen, there are lots of bits that remain, such as onion or carrot peel, rinds, stalks or meat scraps. The grinder turns all these bits into a slurry. "It really becomes kind of a liquefied food waste," Franczyk says. From here, the waste is loaded into a truck and sent to an anaerobic digester. "There's no question it's better than putting it in the trash," Franczyk says. She says the chain is committed to diverting as much waste as possible and aims for zero waste. In addition to food donations, Whole Foods composts; this waste-to-energy system is yet another way to meet its goal. "We really do like the system," she says. We visited Bar-Way Farm, Inc. in Deerfield, Mass. Owner Peter Melnik, a fourth-generation dairy farmer, showed us how his anaerobic digester, which is installed next to his dairy barn, works." We presently take in about a 100 tons [of waste], which is about three tractor-trailer loads, every day," Melnik says. In addition to all the food waste from Whole Foods, he gets whey from a Cabot Creamery in the area, as well as waste from a local brewery and a juice plant. In the digester, he combines all of this waste with manure from his cows. The mixture cooks at about 105 degrees Fahrenheit. As the methane is released, it rises to the top of a large red tank with a black bubble-shaped dome." We capture the gas in that bubble. Then we suck it into a big motor," Melnik explains. Unlike other engines that run on diesel or gasoline, this engine runs on methane." This turns a big generator, which is creating one megawatt of electricity" continuously, Melnik says — enough to power more than just his farm. "We only use about 10 percent of what we make, and the rest is fed onto the [electricity] grid," Melnik explains. It's enough to power about 1,500 homes. He says times are tough for dairy farmers, so this gives him a new stream of revenue. Vanguard pays him rental fees for having the anaerobic digester on his farm. In addition, he's able to use the liquids left over from the process as fertilizer on his fields." The digester has been a home run for us," Melnik says. "It's made us more sustainable — environmentally [and] also economically." Vanguard Renewables hopes to expand its operations in the state and elsewhere. "There's more than enough food waste in Massachusetts to feed all of our five digesters, plus many more," says CEO John Hanselman. Massachusetts has a state law that prohibits the disposal of commercial organic waste — including food — by businesses and institutions that generate at least one ton of this waste per week. This has created an incentive for food businesses to participate in the waste-to-energy initiative. Hanselman points to Europe, where there are thousands of digesters in operation. His hope is that the concept will spread here. "The food waste recycling through anaerobic digestion could be done in every part of the country," Hanselman says. The company is currently building an anaerobic digester on a farm in Vermont. The gas produced there will be piped to Middlebury College, which will help the college reduce its carbon footprint.	True

'Potential Apocalypse': NYT Warns Of Global Warming Floods Of Biblical Proportions The New York Times has taken warnings about global warming to a whole new level, publishing a three-part series suggesting a "potential apocalypse" from melting ice sheets if humans keep pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere." f that ice sheet were to disintegrate, it could raise the level of the sea by more than 160 feet — a potential apocalypse, depending on exactly how fast it happened," NYT reporter Justin Gillis wrote of what some scientists predict could happen to Antarctica. Gillis points to recent research suggesting "the collapse of the ice sheet will become inevitable," likening the projected 160-foot sea-level rise to flood stories from the Epic of Gilgamesh to the Bible's Old Testament." n the Epic of Gilgamesh, waters so overwhelm the mortals that the gods grow frightened, too," Gillis wrote, "In India's version, Lord Vishnu warns a man to take refuge in a boat, carrying seeds. In the Bible, God orders Noah to carry two of every living creature on his ark." I don't think the biblical deluge is just a fairy tale," Terence Hughes, a retired glaciologist told Gillis. "I think some kind of major flood happened all over the world, and it left an indelible imprint on the collective memory of mankind that got preserved in these stories." That flooding would have occurred at the end of the last ice age," Gillis reported. Of course he left out the part about Antarctic ice sheet melting taking place over a couple thousands years. Now, the research Gillis points to is a worst-scenario based on a Parallel Ice Sheet Model, as reported by scientists in a 2015 study. Models can be useful tools to test complex climate interactions, but they are still projections, not facts. That 2015 study found "half the Antarctic ice sheet would melt or fall into the sea in the first thousand years" based on model projections, according to a previous NYT report. The first installment of Gillis's three-part series claimed Antarctica "may have entered the early stages of an unstoppable disintegration," but later in the series admitted the glacier NYT reporters toured with scientists "seems stable now." Even so, the effects of any current global warming on Antarctica are unclear. The South Pole's western ice sheet has been shedding mass for decades, but part of that has to do with underground volcanic activity and the fact the ice sheet rests on water. Recent evidence suggests the Antarctic peninsula has been cooling since the late 1990s. A recent study found the region "has shifted from a warming trend of 0.32 °C/decade during 1979–1997 to a cooling trend of − 0.47 °C/decade during 1999–2014." Antarctica's eastern ice sheet seems more stable, and may have even been gaining mass in recent decades.A 2015 study by NASA found Antarctica's ice sheet increased in mass from 1992 to 2008. The study found ice gains in Eastern Antarctica offset ice loss from the west.

Upside-down "rivers" of warm ocean water may be one of the causes of Antarctica's ice shelves breaking up, leading to a rise in sea levels. A new study suggests that, in the past, increases in Antarctic sea ice in colder climates may have contributed to ice ages. Using computer simulations, the research looked at past changes during the glacial periods and noted that previous increases in sea ice levels may have significantly altered the circulation of the ocean, which led to a reverse greenhouse effect as carbon dioxide levels in the ocean increased and levels in the air decreased." ne key question in the field is still what caused the Earth to periodically cycle in and out of ice ages," University of Chicago professor and the study's co-author, Malte Jansen, said in a statement.

ANTARCTICA'S ICE SHEETS CONTAIN RADIOACTIVE CHLORINE GAS 60 YEARS AFTER NUCLEAR TESTS, STUDY SAYSThe last major ice age ended at the end of the Pleistocene epoch, about 11,700 years ago, as glaciers have periodically grown and then gotten smaller.

"There's no shortage of ideas about how this happens, but it's not quite clear how they all fit together." Researchers also believe a mini-ice age may have occurred roughly 12,800 years ago. It likely stems from an asteroid impact that "rocked the Northern Hemisphere" and led to the Younger Dryas climate event. Jansen pointed out that the Southern Ocean around Antarctica "plays a key role in ocean circulation" due to the deep waters in the region, leading it to have "outsize[d] consequences."

He concluded his remarks with some environmental boosterism.		Trump skipped G7 climate session and thought meeting hadn't happened yet President Donald Trump proclaimed himself an 'environmentalist' Monday after missing a climate change discussion on Monday with other world leaders at the G7 summit in Biarritz, France. At a press conference, the president said he knows 'more about the environment than most people' in part due to his time as a builder, when environmental concerns often pose last-minute roadblocks to a project. At a summit where relentless fires in the Amazon provided a backdrop, Trump did not respond directly when asked if he still harbored doubts about global warming, vouching for his environmental credentials by pointing to numerous environmental impact statements he has been involved with.'I went the cleanest water on earth. I want to cleanest air on earth. And that's what we're doing. I'm an environmentalist,' Trump told reporters at the end of the summit.'A lot of people don't understand that I have done more environmental impact statements probably than anybody, that's I guess I can say definitely because I've done many, many, many of them. More than anybody that's ever been president or vice president or anything even close to president. And I think I know more about the environment than most people,' he said. Trump was referencing his time as a builder, when an environmental review is part of the construction process. Although he steered clear of the global warming debate, after long expressing doubts, Trump touted the value of U.S. oil and liquified national gas reserves, and called for new infrastructure to harness it. He said the domestic industry is creating 'tremendous wealth, and LNG is being sought over all over Europe and all over the world.''I'm not going to lose that wealth. I'm not going to lose it on dreams — on windmills, which, frankly, aren't working too well,' Trump said, once again taking a shot at a growing renewable energy source.'I want clean air. I want clean water I want a wealthy country. I want a spectacular country with jobs, with pensions, with so many things and that's what we're getting so I want to be very careful at the same time at the same time … it's very important to me, very important to me, we have to maintain this incredible – this incredible place that we've all built. We've become much richer country and that's a good thing, not a bad thing because that great wealth allows us to take care of people,' Trump said. He concluded his remarks with some environmental boosterism.'We can take care of people that we couldn't afford taking care of the past because of the great wealth we can't let that wealth is taken away clean air clean water – thank you very much everybody I appreciate it, thank you,' he concluded. Trump was scheduled to attend the session on climate, biodiversity and oceans, but his chair remained empty while other leaders pledged a modest $20 million to help put out fires that are raging across wide swaths of the Amazon jungles in Brazil.'He wasn't in the room but his team was there,' French President Emmanuel Macron said. The White House attributed his absence to scheduled one-on-one meetings that he attended with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel – both of whom managed to attend.'The President had scheduled meetings and bilaterals with Germany and India, so a senior member of the Administration attended in his stead,' White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told DailyMail. com and other news outlets.A White House official said the stand-in was an aide from the National Security Council. Trump started the morning behind schedule. His meeting with Merkel was delayed about two hours. Asked about the global warming meeting during a photo-op with Merkel, the president said: 'We're having it in a little while.'He had no reply to a journalist who informed him that it was already underway. During his meeting with Modi, Trump said that he wants 'clean air and clean water,' but made no comment about his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord. He did offer, however, that the climate change discussion would be his next stop. That never materialized. Trump is a climate change skeptic who once claimed it was a hoax invented by the Chinese. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Monday that the world faces 'a dramatic climate emergency.' He will ask leaders at a Sept. 23 summit in New York to agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than they promised in the 2015 Paris agreement. Guterres said Monday that 'we are much worse than we were during Paris ... and so it's absolutely essential that countries commit themselves to increase what was promised.'Guterres claimed that Greenland's ice cap was melting 'dramatically' and that 2015 through 2019 were 'the five hottest years on record.'

The withdrawal of the two scientists as well as an agency consultant has sparked fresh criticism about EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's skepticism toward the broad scientific community's conclusion that human-caused global warming is a proven fact and a growing concern. The conference where the scientists were scheduled to speak coincided with the release of a report showing the threats of climate change to Narragansett Bay, the 196- square-mile estuary whose watershed encompasses 1,705 square miles with more than 100 towns and cities that are home to nearly 2 million people." Climate change is affecting air and water temperatures, precipitation, sea level, and fish in the Narragansett Bay region," the report, which was partially funded by the EPA, concludes. Narragansett Bay is one of 28 estuaries that make up the National Estuary Program, an EPA program designed "to protect and restore the water quality and ecological integrity of estuaries of national significance." Rhode Island's two U.S. senators — Democrats Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse — criticized the EPA's decision during an appearance Monday at the conference in Providence, R.I." This has traditionally been a bipartisan issue," Whitehouse said, citing former Rhode Island GOP Sen. John Chafee's role establishing the estuary program. "So there is no reason for it to have to be this way.  And it should not take away from the terrific scientific work that is being done, because at the heart of all this is not the politics, it's the knowledge." Reed said he was "disheartened and disappointed" that the EPA scientists were not allowed to publicly present their findings." This type of political interference or scientific censorship — whatever you want to call it — is ill-advised and does a real disservice to the American people and public health. Scientific evidence and input is crucial to policy efforts.  It informs decision makers. We can debate the issues, we can have different viewpoints but we should all be able to objectively examine the data and look at the evidence ... Now is not the time to turn a blind eye to what science is telling us, that climate change and other factors are influencing the health of this estuary ... I hope the Trump administration will look at the facts, read this report, and reconsider its stance on trying to muzzle scientists who present evidence that doesn't conform to their political agenda." The EPA has not responded to a request for comment. Agency spokesman John Konkus told The Washington Post  in an email Sunday that "EPA scientists are attending, they simply are not presenting, it is not an EPA conference." The agency officials initially scheduled to speak during the conference are Autumn Oczkowski, a research ecologist at the EPA's National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory Atlantic Ecology Division in Rhode Island, and Rose Martin, a postdoctoral fellow at the same EPA laboratory, according to The New York Times, which first reported the story. Emily Shumchenia, an EPA consultant, was also scheduled to take part in an afternoon panel titled "The Present and Future Biological Implications of Climate Change."

Sea level rise is accelerating.	3°F of average temperature increase and three feet of sea level rise by 2050.	They can't accept the truth of that, so they deny the science of climate change.		Donald Trump's new climate change debacle CNN just posted an article about rising sea levels. It's good to know that the editors are much smarter than President Donald Trump or his equally climate denying Environmental Protection Agency Commissioner, Scott Pruitt. The EPA matters because climate change is right up there with the national debt as a threat to national security. The DoD, in a recent report, says that rising sea levels will put more than a thousand military installations in serious jeopardy. But CNN is wrong in their projections. I've just returned from Antarctica on a research trip to validate the most likely temperature and sea level rise projections in the ClyFy novel I'm writing. 3°F of average temperature increase and three feet of sea level rise by 2050. The scientists all agreed these were plausible.I commented, "Two feet by 2100? Get real. 3 feet by 2050. Talk to me after Cat 6 hurricanes blanket the Caribbean every year. Last year was just a preview. Pay attention CNN." Sea level rise is accelerating. One witty Facebook user quipped, "I will be dead by that time so who cares?" I thought he was being sarcastic, but he turned out to be dead serious. And there you have it. This is why deniers exist. They don't want to spend their own money to solve a problem that might affect their grandkids and not themselves. It's pure, unadulterated selfishness. They can't accept the truth of that, so they deny the science of climate change. The equation that is most dangerous, according to Jeffrey Kluger of Time, is n=1, otherwise stated as, "If it matters to me, it counts. If not, I don't give a damn." Trump and Pruitt and others of their ilk might have greed and corruption as motives. But n=1 applies to them, too.	False

Madrid (AFP) - A UN climate summit in Madrid was on life support Saturday after marathon negotiations between countries left them more divided than ever over on how to fight global warming and pay for its ravages. Diplomats from rich nations, emerging giants and the world's poorest countries -- each for their own reasons -- found fault with a draft agreement put forward by host Chile in a botched attempt to strike common ground. Faced with fire-alarm warnings from science, deadly extreme weather made worse by climate change, and weekly strikes by millions of young people, negotiations in Madrid were under pressure to send a clear signal that governments were willing to double down in tackling the crisis. But the 12-day talks, more than 24 hours after their scheduled end, had retreated even further from this goal on Saturday. Simon Stiell, Grenada envoy, told AFP that the lack of ambition in the initial agreement text was "crazy"." It isn't reflective of the kids who are demonstrating on the streets the world over, communities being washed away by rising sea levels," he said late Saturday." We wanted provisions that were in the Paris agreement to remain and what we see at every COP it just seems to be another opportunity to erode those." Veteran observers of UN climate talks were stunned by the state of play nearly 24 hours after the negotiations had been due to close."I have never seen such a disconnect between what the science requires and the people of the world demand, versus what the climate negotiations are delivering," Alden Meyer, strategy and policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told AFP. Alexandria Villasenor, a 14-year-old climate activist, said she was "disappointed" in the lack of action at COP 25." The difference between the youth on the streets and the negotiations is that the youth on the streets are acting with urgency," she told AFP." COP 25 has failed us and it's another year of failure." Under the Paris accord, countries agreed in 2015 to work to limit global temperature rises to "well below" two degrees Celsius through a series of voluntary action pledges that step up over time. The push for a strengthening of voluntary carbon cutting plans is led by small-island and least-developed states, along with the European Union. Ministers from this "high ambition coalition" have called out countries they see as blocking a consensus call for all countries to step up, notably the United States, Australia and Saudi Arabia. China and India, the world's No. 1 and No. 4 carbon emitters, have made it clear they see no need to improve on their current emissions reduction plans, which run to 2030. These emerging giants have chosen instead to emphasise the historical responsibility of rich nations to lead the way and provide financing to poor countries. Observers told AFP Saturday evening that a possible landing ground had emerged in which China agreed to yield a little over language surrounding ambition in return for a clear reiteration of historic polluters' obligation to do more. The COP 25 summit was also meant to finalise a chapter on carbon markets in the Paris rulebook, which goes into effect next year. Some nations, notably Brazil and Australia, want to count carbon credits accumulated under a previous climate deal as part of their commitments under the Paris goals, further stymying progress. The United States, which is leaving the landmark Paris climate deal next year, was accused of acting as a spoiler on a number of issues vital to climate-vulnerable nations. This included so-called "loss and damage" funding to help disaster-hit countries repair and rebuild." The US has not come here in good faith," said Harjeet Singh, climate lead with charity ActionAid." They continue to block the world's efforts to help people whose lives have been turned upside down by climate change." Even if nations in Madrid snatch victory from the jaws of defeat and agree to implement their pledges, Earth is on course to warm more than 3C by 2100." If there was one time in the history when I would say governments fucked up, I would say today in Madrid, governments fucked up," said Mohamed Adow, Director of Power Shift Africa." People across the world must rise to save the planet."	False
