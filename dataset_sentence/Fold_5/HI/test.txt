Here are three key facts to know about the person who will soon be overseeing the Environmental Protection Agency.	Inhofe was among Pruitts biggest fans although the barrage of scandals ultimately began to dim his enthusiasm.	As a New York Times story lays out Murray was the architect of a so called environmental regulations wish list which detailed a list of policies aimed at reinvigorating the coal industry like curbing restrictions on greenhouse gases and slashing staff at the EPA.	A number of Pruitt policies are thought to be shoddily constructed and have faced significant legal challenges.	Wheeler and Murray were photographed at a March 2017 meeting with Energy Secretary Rick Perry where many of these policies were purportedly discussed.	False
But while the rule was applauded by environmentalists for improving drinking water protections and aiding wildlife that relies on wetlands it was attacked by some farmers and golf course operators who claimed it hindered their ability to manage their land.	Signing his order the president said thousands of jobs were at risk because the EPA decided that navigable waters can mean nearly every puddle or every ditch on a farmers land or anyplace else that they decide.	Green groups however said the move pandered to fossil fuel and farming interests and was part of an agenda to weaken clean water protections.	The Obama administration widened this definition to include the drinking water of about 117 million Americans.	The rule was meant to end years of confusion over which waterways were federally protected from pollution with the clean water rule simply designating navigable waters for safeguards.	True
What are we looking for?	Laney Wall who lost her home in the Sonoma County community of Fountaingrove asked why homeowners had to go through the expense trouble and wait of the clean up at all.

The official echoed Can we stay on topic please?	The official insisted his own views were irrelevant while a White House staff member interjected Can we stay on topic please?	One of the administration officials responded If you look at the Europeans if you look at other major economies or allies or partners they have a strong interest in finding common ground with the United States and again we dont want to get out ahead of ourselves here on what may be discussed or not.	I think its a little bit more nuanced than stay in or not.	But they pointed to Americas existing record.	True

Administrator Pruitt was working for environmental justice by meeting with the real residents affected by lead contamination and by committing to get results.	We need them to commit to adjusting cleanup plan for the site.

Trump wants to redistribute that water to Californians he says.	While she has worked for the department since 2013 environmentalists accuse her of gutting protections for migratory birds and endangered species.

As you can see we're continuing the president's agenda post haste.	Though not as controversial or ethically compromised as PruittWheeler is opposed by a number of environmental groups who sharply criticize the president's aggressive efforts to undo Obama era rules they say are designed to protect the environment and address climate change.	While leading President Donald Trump's deregulatory agenda Wheeler also has emphasized the agency's work to clean up Superfund sites and for the first time begin regulating a set ofharmful chemicalsfound in drinking water systems that serve millions of Americans.	It's a sad day for public health and the EPA but missionaccomplished for the fossil fuel and chemical industries Ken Cook president of the Environmental Working Group said in a statement following the vote.
