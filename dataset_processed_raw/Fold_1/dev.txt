But a new analysis has delivered a blow to that defense, concluding that the nation's greenhouse gas emissions rose sharply in 2018. Emissions in the country jumped 3.4 percent last year, the second largest annual increase in more than two decades, according to a preliminary estimate by the economic research company Rhodium Group. The analysis comes on the heels of two gut-wrenching climate reports, one by the United Nations and another authored by scientists from more than a dozen federal agencies in the U.S., that warn the world is running out of time to stave off catastrophic, and potentially irreversible, climate change. The Trump administration continues to dismiss and downplay the crisis. "I don't believe it," President Donald Trump, who has a long history of climate change denial, said of his own administration's report. He added that "we're the cleanest we've ever been." Between 2005 and 2017, CO2 emissions in the U.S. fell by about 14 percent. Administration officials have touted these declines to explain their push to boost fossil fuels, as well as to defend the president's decision last year to withdraw the U.S. from the historic Paris accord on combating climate change." e are moving forward, but we are not moving forward in a detrimental impact to our economy as what the Paris climate accord would have called for," Wheeler said. "We are reducing our CO2 emissions faster than most other developed countries. We have our own plan. We're moving forward. We're addressing the issue." Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who resigned Jan. 2 under a cloud of ethics scandals, told the National Petroleum Council last month that the administration's "regulatory philosophy" is to partner with the fossil fuel sector, which he said was at "the leading edge of technology." The U.S. has "lead the charge" in cutting emissions of CO2 and methane, a potent greenhouse gas, he added." veryone else is up," he said, referring to other countries' overall emissions. "We're going down while we have our record-breaking oil and gas production." But as Rhodium Group's new analysis makes clear, that was not the case in 2018. The emissions uptick ― the largest since the economic bounce back from the recession that ended in mid-2009 ― comes despite a record number of coal-fired power plants going offline, replaced largely by the use of natural gas. Along with an 1.9 percent spike in power sector emissions, increases occurred in the transportation, industry and buildings sectors, according to Rhodium. Contributing to the overall increase were the growing U.S. economy, a cold start to the year that required additional energy for heating, and the "limited progress made in developing decarbonization strategies," the analysis found." ith a new Congress in session, we demand they heed these warnings (about climate change) and step up to act at the scale of the crisis," she said in a statement. The administration has aggressively rolled back environmental and climate regulations, including President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, a policy limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. At Interior, Zinke overturned an Obama-era moratorium on new coal leases on federal land, scrapped a hydraulic fracturing rule meant to better protect public health and curtailed a rule limiting the amount of methane that can be released from oil and gas operations on federal and Native American lands. Even amid the current partial government shutdown, the administration has prioritized fossil fuels. The Interior Department, one of the main agencies affected by the shutdown. is still issuing permits for oil companies, according to Bloomberg. And the agency is continuing its push to open Alaska's fragile Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, holding public meetings as part of its ongoing environmental review process, Alaska Public Media reported.

733	Vox	left_bias	2017-06-01	Video: President Trump pulls US out of Paris climate deal President Donald Trump announced his decision to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord at 3 pm Eastern in the White House Rose Garden. A live stream of the announcement is embedded above. Multiple reports indicate that Trump is likely to announce a withdrawal from the agreement — though many of these reports have expressed at least some uncertainty, including about precisely what language Trump would use. Jonathan Swan of Axios reported that, per "two sources with direct knowledge of the decision," Trump has decided to pull out of the agreement. The Daily Beast's Lachlan Markay reports that the White House is telling congressional staff that Trump will pull out. The Associated Press's Jill Colvin and Julie Pace, though, report that "Trump's decision may not be entirely clear-cut" and that aides continued to deliberate on "caveats in the language." The actual Paris deal — agreed to by 195 countries in December 2015 — is aspirational rather than binding, calling on countries to set goals for emissions reduction. Still, the withdrawal of the US would send an unmistakable signal to the rest of the world that the country with the second-highest carbon emissions is no longer interested in even pretending to care about reducing them. For years now it's been clear that blocking environmental regulations and obstructing action on climate change are top Republican Party priorities. The GOP's leading politicians and media outlets have tended to praise fossil fuel companies and ignore or cast doubt on climate science. The major Republican presidential candidates harshly criticized the Paris deal in particular, and Trump promised to withdraw from it during the campaign. Still, withdrawing from such a recent agreement that the vast majority of countries across the world have signed on to has serious consequences for America's role as a global leader. So the question of whether the US should actually pull out of the agreement has reportedly been the subject of intense debate within the Trump administration. According to Politico's Andrew Restuccia and Josh Dawsey, White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt have been the leading voices urging Trump to withdraw, while Ivanka Trump and the so-called "New York" or "globalist" White House camp have been advocating for staying in. Silicon Valley business leaders like Apple CEO Tim Cook and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have also been arguing that the US should stick to the agreement.	False	False	True	False	False
240	dailymail	questionable_source	2019-10-02	'You look happier since leaving the US!' Greta Thunberg reassures fans with smiling snap from Quebec Fans of Greta Thunberg have expressed relief after the 16-year-old posted a string of smiling photographs on Instagram. The environmental activist's recent images, taken while touring Canada's east coast in Montreal and Quebec, are in sharp contrast to images of the 16-year-old speaking in an emotionally charged appearance last month at the Climate Action Summit 2019 in New York. A photo of Greta scowling when she spotted Donald Trump went viral. The teenage campaigner, who has 7.2million followers on Instagram, looks decidedly happier since she crossed the border from the US, something which her followers haven't failed to notice. Writing on Instagram, Greta said: 'So happy to say that the following weeks I'll travel slowly through the North American continent, moving southwest and then eventually through South America towards Santiago. I will stop on the way and visit as many places as I can, and of course protest every Friday no matter where I am.'Yesterday the teenager posted an image of herself at the Marine Mammal Interpretation Centre in Tadoussac, Québec, after spending a morning watching whales. The tone of Greta's images have changed significantly since she addressed the United Nations Climate Summit on September 23rd, where she came close to tears in a emotional speech to international delegates. She told them: 'I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us for hope. How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,'During the same appearance, Greta was seen at the UN headquarters with an enraged expression on her face as US President Donald Trump upstaged her entrance by walking in flanked by news reporters, an image that promptly went viral. Among the comments posted by the environmentalist's followers, many remarked how much happier the teenager had looked in recent days. On Instagram, Jesuissuzette wrote: 'Greta, you look so much happier now that you're out of America. Enjoy your travels. And thank you for your intrepid Climate Crisis campaign.'Last week, Thunberg addressed on social media the negativity she's received for speaking out on climate change, saying: 'Here we go again... As you may have noticed, the haters are as active as ever - going after me, my looks, my clothes, my behaviour and my differences. They come up with every thinkable lie and conspiracy theory. It seems they will cross every possible line to avert the focus, since they are so desperate not to talk about the climate and ecological crisis. Being different is not an illness and the current, best available science is not opinions - it's facts.'Greta, who is taking a sabbatical year from school, arrived in North America in August, taking a two-week crossing on carbon neutral yacht Malizia II to address the United Nations. Greta Thunberg's fiery speech at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York   This is all wrong. I shouldn't be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to me for hope? How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet I'm one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you! For more than 30 years the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away, and come here saying that you are doing enough, when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight. You say you "hear" us and that you understand the urgency. But no matter how sad and angry I am, I don't want to believe that. Because if you fully understood the situation and still kept on failing to act, then you would be evil. And I refuse to believe that. The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50% chance of staying below 1.5C degrees, and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control. Maybe 50% is acceptable to you. But those numbers don't include tipping points, most feedback loops, additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution or the aspects of justice and equity. They also rely on my and my children's generation sucking hundreds of billions of tonnes of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist. So a 50% risk is simply not acceptable to us – we who have to live with the consequences. To have a 67% chance of staying below a 1.5C global temperature rise – the best odds given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – the world had 420 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide left to emit back on 1 January 2018. Today that figure is already down to less than 350 gigatonnes. How dare you pretend that this can be solved with business-as-usual and some technical solutions. With today's emissions levels, that remaining CO2 budget will be entirely gone in less than eight and a half years. There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures today. Because these numbers are too uncomfortable. And you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is. You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming, whether you like it or not.	False	True	True	False	False
640	Fox News	right_bias	2017-06-02	Paris agreement on climate change: World reaction to US pullout World leaders reacted with dismay Thursday to President Trump's announcement that he was pulling out of the Paris climate accord, while three prominent European heads of state rejected his suggestion that the deal could be renegotiated. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and  and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni said in a joint statement that they regretted the United States' decision to withdraw from the accord, but affirmed "our strongest commitment" to implement its measures and encouraged "all our partners to speed up their action to combat climate change." While Trump said the United States would be willing to rejoin the accord if it could obtain more favorable terms, the three European leaders said the agreement cannot be renegotiated, "since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economics." Macron repeated that belief in an English-language speech from the Elysee presidential palace, unprecedented from a French president in an address at home. He said, "I do respect this decision but I do think it is an actual mistake both for the U.S. and for our planet." Wherever we live, whoever we are, we all share the same responsibility: make our planet great again," Macron added. The European Union's top climate change official, Miguel Arias Canente, said in a statement that Trump's decision to leave the Paris accord made it "a sad day for the global community," adding that the bloc "deeply regrets the unilateral decision." Canete also predicted that the EU would seek new alliances from the world's largest economies to the most vulnerable island states, as well as U.S. businesses and individuals supportive of the accord.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement "a major disappointment" and said it was "crucial that the United States remains a leader on environmental issues," according to his spokesman. Norway's largest pension fund with 53 billion euro ($59.5 billion) in assets under its management said it would continue to invest in renewable energy despite the American president's decision, saying in a statement that "Donald Trump is jumping off a train that has already left the station." Chief executive Odd Arild Grefstad cited the growth of renewable energy in U.S. states such as Texas, New York and California as signs that "the world has started the transition from fossil to a renewable economy." In Mexico, former President Vicente Fox criticized Trump's move, saying on Twitter: "He's declaring war on the planet itself." Fox, who has clashed with Trump since last year's presidential campaign, said the U.S. leader's decision "condemns this generation and those to come" and would leave "a dark legacy just to satisfy your greediness." Bill Ford, chairman of the Ford Motor Co., also weighed in, saying: "We believe climate change is real, and remain deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities." Before Trump announced his decision Thursday afternoon, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told reporters during a visit to Berlin that fighting global warming was a "global consensus" and an "international responsibility." Without mentioning the U.S. specifically, Li said that "China in recent years has stayed true to its commitment" and pointed out that his was one of the first countries to ratify the 2015 Paris Agreement. While traveling abroad last week, Trump was repeatedly pressed to stay in the deal by European leaders and Pope Francis. Withdrawing would leave the United States as one of just three countries outside the agreement. The other two are Syria and Nicaragua. Russia joined the chorus speaking out for the climate accord. Speaking to reporters on Thursday before Trump's decision was announced, a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin said Russia "thinks highly" of the accords and sees no alternative to it. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov added that its implementation will not be as effective "without the key signatories." Scientists say Earth is likely to reach more dangerous levels of warming sooner if the U.S. retreats from its pledge because America contributes so much to rising temperatures. Calculations suggest withdrawal could release up to 3 billion additional tons of carbon dioxide a year -- enough to melt ice sheets faster, raise seas higher and trigger more extreme weather.

10	drudgereport	right_bias	2019-07-25	POLL: Dems, Republicans can't even agree on weather! NEW YORK (Reuters) - Only 200 miles separate Michael Tilden and Miranda Garcia in rain-soaked Iowa. But they are worlds apart when it comes to their opinion of the weather. Garcia, a 38-year-old former journalist and Democrat from Des Moines, thinks flooding has been getting worse in the state, which just came out of its wettest 12-months on record. Tilden, a 44-year-old math teacher and Republican from Sioux City, thinks otherwise: "I've noticed essentially the same weather pattern every single year," he said. Their different takes underscore a broader truth about the way Americans perceive extreme weather: Democrats are far more likely to believe droughts, floods, wildfires, hurricanes and tropical storms have become more frequent or intense where they live in the last decade, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. The divergence shows how years of political squabbling over global warming - including disputes over its existence - have grown deep roots, distorting the way Americans view the world around them. The divide will play into the 2020 election as Democratic hopefuls seek to sell aggressive proposals to reduce or even end fossil fuel consumption by drawing links between climate change and recent floods, storms and wildfires. Nearly two-thirds of Democrats believe severe thunderstorms and floods have become more frequent, compared to 42% and 50% of Republicans, respectively, according to the poll. About half of Democrats, meanwhile, think droughts, hurricanes and tropical storms are more common in their region, versus less than a third of Republicans, according to the poll. Similarly, nearly seven in 10 Democrats said in the poll that severe weather events such as thunderstorms have become more intense, compared to 4 of 10 Republicans. And nearly half of Republicans said there has been no change in the intensity of severe weather over the past decade, versus a fifth of Democrats. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English between June 11 and 14 and gathered responses from 3,281 people. It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 2 percentage points up or down.U.S. government researchers have concluded that tropical cyclone activity, rainfall, and the frequency of intense single-day storms have been on the rise, according to data compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency. For example, six of the 10 most active years for tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin since 1950 have occurred since the mid-1990s, and nine of the top 10 years for extreme one-day precipitation events nationwide have occurred since 1990, according to the data." e do expect to see more intense storms," said David Easterling, a spokesman for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's National Centers for Environmental Information. An overwhelming majority of scientists believe human consumption of fossil fuels is driving sweeping changes in the global climate by ramping up the concentration of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere. But it is impossible to draw a direct link between the changes in U.S. weather in the recent past to the larger trend of warming. President Donald Trump has cast doubt on the science of climate change, saying he believes that research into its severity, causes and effects is not yet settled. Two years ago he announced the United States would withdraw from a global pact to reduce carbon emissions, the Paris Climate Agreement, a deal Trump said could damage the U.S. economy. Still, a majority of Republicans believe the United States should take "aggressive action" to combat global warming, Reuters polling shows. Some Republican lawmakers have offered proposals for "market-based" approaches to fend off climate change, such as cap-and-trade systems that would force companies to cut carbon emissions or buy credits from those that do. Democrats are pushing more aggressive ideas. Nearly all of the party's presidential hopefuls, who seek to unseat Trump in next year's election, have put forward proposals to end U.S. fossil fuels consumption within a few decades to make the country carbon neutral. Trump has slammed the idea, saying it would "kill millions of jobs" and "crush the dreams of the poorest Americans." Jennifer Marlon, a research scientist at the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, said the divergence in the way American perceive the weather is being driven by factors including the news they consume and their social circles. Liberals are more likely to expose themselves to news outlets and people who believe climate change is an urgent threat that affects current weather patterns. For more conservative Americans, the link between weather and climate change is "not a typical conversation," Marlon said. Last year, the Yale program - which carries out scientific research on public knowledge about climate change - set out to map the partisan divide on how people perceive the effects of global warming across the United States. It found that 22% of Republicans reported personally experiencing climate change, compared to 60% of Democrats. Scientists and researchers at the University of Michigan, the University of Exeter and others came to a similar conclusion in a 2018 study which found that political bias and partisan news reporting can affect whether people indicate experiencing certain extreme weather events.

557	dailymail	questionable_source	2018-02-11	Lawsuit says Trump's wall threatens endangered species A tiny endangered butterfly could stop President Donald Trump from building his beloved border wall.A lawsuit has been filed by the Center for Biological Diversity, environmental groups and the State of California against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. It outlines that the Quino checkerspot butterfly, Riverside fairy shrimp and the Pacific pocket mouse will be threatened if the border wall is built. The butterfly, which is native to southern California and Northern Mexico, is already on the endangered species list. The lawsuit contends that the Department of Homeland Security does not have the ability to waive environmental laws requiring review before building the wall. The suit seeks a ruling that a border wall with Mexico must go through normal environmental reviews, which could block construction or at least cause major delays. The challengers contend that authority to waive the environmental reviews falls under a 2005 law which has expired.'The Trump administration can't use an expired waiver to bypass crucial environmental protections to build these destructive projects,' Brian Segee, a senior attorney at CBD,told San Diego TV station KGTV.'It's time to stop Trump's hateful bombast and his executive overreach here in San Diego before it goes any further. The law and the Constitution are firmly on our side, and we think the judge will agree.'The DHS is arguing that it is within its right to issue the waivers, citing a 1996 immigration law. The case was set to be heard on Friday in San Diego by US District Judge Gonzalo Curiel. Curiel came to national attention in 2016 when he was presiding over one of the cases against Trump University. Trump said that he was biased because of his 'Mexican Heritage' and Trump's stance on the border. At the time, he told CNN: 'We are building a wall. He's a Mexican. We're building a wall between here and Mexico.'Now Curiel will be hearing a case about the wall. On Friday he heard two-and-a-half hours of arguments and said that he was leaning toward deciding he has jurisdiction in a lawsuit that alleges the Trump administration overreached in waiving laws that require environmental and other reviews. The administration argues he doesn't have jurisdiction. Curiel asked the administration and wall opponents to file additional briefings by the end of Tuesday.	True	False	True	False	False
602	The Daily Caller	right_bias	2017-04-07	Enviro-Funded Report Ties Exxon Crusade To Largest Oil Spill In History Global warming is partially responsible for a decades-old oil spill that happened after an Exxon Mobil tanker hit a barrier reef, according to a Los Angeles Times report funded in part by liberal billionaire George Soros. The LA Times published a wide-ranging piece Thursday suggesting climate change laid the groundwork for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill, a disaster that eventually dumped more than 10 million gallons of crude off the coast of Alaska. Higher than normal water temperatures near Prince William Sound caused ice bergs to chip off the Columbia Glacier and force the ship into uncharted territory. Floating chunks of ice forced the tanker out of its primary shipping lane, the paper noted. It veered off and crashed into the Bligh Reef, causing Exxon more than $3.4 billion through 2008 in cleanup costs and court settlements. Columbia Journalism School's Energy and Environment Reporting Project, the group that conducted the paper's report, was also involved in an investigation last November targeting Exxon's climate change research. Thursday's report dovetails with the group's previous investigations showing the oil company hid knowledge about climate change from the public for years." or the two decades following the Exxon Valdez disaster, the company worked quietly to safeguard its operations and infrastructure against steadily rising sea levels and thawing permafrost," The LA Times wrote. "Yet in public, it vociferously fought regulations and policies that would have limited fossil fuel emissions while publicly questioning the science behind climate change." Some climate scientists believe the LA Times is taking a leap of faith. Roy Spencer, a climate scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, for one, told The Daily Caller News Foundation that "ice always calves off glaciers, because snow falls on the mountains, and the ice flows downhill — no global warming needed." There is a perfectly reasonable explanation for why ice bergs were cleaving off glaciers at the time of the Valdez disaster, he said, and it doesn't really have anything to do with man-made global warming." f the Columbia Glacier was calving more in the 1980s, it's most likely because the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) flipped in the late 1970s, which caused it to suddenly warm in Alaska," Spencer added, referencing an El Nino-like weather pattern that commonly affects the area the oil spill. What happened to the Valdez is no different than what happened to the Titanic, he said, referring to the passenger ship that hit an iceberg in 1912, which killed thousands of people heading to New York from England. Several wealthy philanthropic groups such as the Rockefeller Brothers Fund (RBF), Rockefeller Family Fund (RFF), and the Open Society Foundations bankrolled large portions of the LA Times' report. Soros is the director and founder of Open Society and has financed climate crusades in the past. RFF has single-handedly financially propped up the anti-Exxon campaign. It also pressured various attorneys general into investigating Exxon, namely for the purposes of bringing the company up on racketeering charges. The only way to target Exxon for hiding climate change research was to request the New York AGs office to open an investigation into the company, David Kaiser and Lee Wasserman, directors of RFF, wrote in an editorial for New York Books. The LA Times, for its part, has failed in the past to disclose its ties with RFF. Wasserman wrote an op-ed in January for the California paper, fleshing out specifics about the probes into Exxon's climate research. The paper disclosed the Wasserman's financial contributions to the investigation, but falsely suggested RFF had nothing to do with the investigations." he Fund has made grants to the Columbia Journalism School's Energy and Environment Reporting Project and InsideClimate News, but has no involvement in articles they produce," the paper's disclosure notes. The disclosure implies RFF did not actively participate in the investigations, which were first reported by environmental media group, InsideClimate News and the LA Times last November.

378	foxnews	right_bias	2018-11-25	Al Gore blasts Trump for 'burying' climate report by releasing it on Black Friday Former Vice President Al Gore accused the Trump administration of trying to "bury' a damning government report that linked global warming to the worsening of natural disasters by quietly releasing the study on the Friday after Thanksgiving. Gore, who since his time as vice president has become an outspoken advocate for the need to counteract the effects of global warming, said in a statement that the White House was trying to "bury this critical U.S. assessment of the climate crisis" by releasing it the day after Thanksgiving. The day, known as Black Friday, has become the traditional start of the holiday shopping season and one that most Americans have off from work." nbelievably deadly and tragic wildfires rage in the West, hurricanes batter our coasts — and the Trump administration chooses the Friday after Thanksgiving to try and bury this critical U.S. assessment of the climate crisis," Gore said in a statement that he posted on Twitter Friday. "The president may try to hide the truth, but his own scientists and experts have made it as stark and clear as possible." The National Climate Assessment, which is mandated by law every few years and is based on more than 1,000 previous research studies, details how global warming -- from the burning of coal, oil and gas -- is hurting each region of the United States and how it impacts different sectors of the economy, including energy and agriculture. It was written long before the deadly fires in California this month and before Hurricanes Florence and Michael raked the East Coast and Florida." Climate change is transforming where and how we live and presents growing challenges to human health and quality of life, the economy, and the natural systems that support us," the report says. This includes worsening air pollution causing heart and lung problems, more diseases from insects, the potential for a jump in deaths during heat waves, and nastier allergies, according to the report." nnual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century — more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many U.S. states," the report says. It'll be especially costly on the nation's coasts because of rising seas and severe storm surges, which will lower property values. And in some areas, such as parts of Alaska and Louisiana, coastal flooding will likely force people to relocate." While Gore has become one of the most prominent advocates for reducing carbon emissions and fighting to reduce the effect of climate change, the former vice president has not been immune from claims that his work is not as altruistic as it appears. Gore left the vice president's residence with a relatively modest net worth of $1.7 million -- mostly from family farm assets -- but since the release of his 2006 documentary "An Inconvenient Truth" and his continuing global tour to preach his message, he has amassed a fortune valued at upward of $200 million. From the fossil fuels he burns jetting around the globe, to his socializing with Hollywood heavy hitters, to his 6,500-square-foot seafront home in California that cost $8.8 million, some climate activists have questioned whether Gore is helping or hurting the climate fight." e is a flawed character," Stephen Lacey, editor-in-chief of the magazine GreenTechMedia, said on his podcast "The Energy Gang" last year. "We're in an era of backlash against elites, so Gore, a guy who bought a 6,500-square-foot seafront home in California for $8.8 million, and who hangs around with other celebrities who talk big on climate but who live lavish lifestyles, is the perfect target at this point in time." Gore's lifestyle aside, his statement comes amid what appears to be a continuing denial from Trump and members of his administration about the dangers climate change poses to the environment and to the world's economy. Earlier in the week, Trump tweeted about the brutal cold spell that hit the East Coast over the Thanksgiving holiday and questioned "Whatever happened to Global Warming?"Friday's report seemed to anticipate such comments, saying: "Over shorter timescales and smaller geographic regions, the influence of natural variability can be larger than the influence of human activity ... Over climate timescales of multiple decades, however, global temperature continues to steadily increase." The Lower 48 states have warmed 1.8 degrees (1 degree Celsius) since 1900 with 1.2 degrees in the last few decades, according to the report. By the end of the century, the U.S. will be 3 to 12 degrees (1.6 to 6.6 degrees Celsius) hotter depending on how much greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, the report warns. Releasing the report on Black Friday "is a transparent attempt by the Trump administration to bury this report and continue the campaign of not only denying, but suppressing the best of climate science," said study co-author Andrew Light, an international policy expert at the World Resources Institute. During a press conference Friday, officials behind the report repeatedly declined to answer questions about the timing of its release and why it contradicts public statements from Trump. Report director David Reidmiller said questions about the timing were "relevant," but said what was in the report was more important. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

386	thedailycaller	right_bias	2018-12-18	Al Gore: Migrant Caravan Is A 'Startling Example' Of Global Warming Former Vice President Al Gore said the Central American migrant caravan seeking asylum in the U.S. is a "recent, startling example" of global warming forcing people from their homes." eople from all over the world are being forced to migrate because the climate crisis is affecting their livelihood. The migrant caravan from Central America is a recent, startling example," Gore tweeted Monday. The migrant caravan, made up of thousands of mostly young males from Honduras and other Central American countries, arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border in November seeking asylum. Migrants are fleeing violent, corrupt countries with poor economies, but some environmentalists and journalists claim global warming is also to blame. Gore pointed to a Financial Times video on "climate change and the migrant caravan," claiming that while most migrants are fleeing violence, "climate change is also playing a part" based on an interview with a farmer-turned-migrant who's crop failed. The video, published on Dec. 13, largely reflects arguments made by some media outlets in the past few months that migrant caravans to the U.S. are a "preview of climate migrations" — meaning people driven from their homes due to global warming. Many experts who have seriously examined claims linking climate to violent conflict and mass migrations have found little evidence to support such claims, but the media still applied the narrative by linking global warming to Central American migrations." xperts say that … climate change in the region is exacerbating – and sometimes causing – a miasma of other problems including crop failures and poverty," The Guardian reported in October." nd they warn that in the coming decades, it is likely to push millions more people north towards the US," the paper reported. Central American officials also claim global warming is part of the reason why their citizens are fleeing en mass. Governments say droughts have been made more frequent and intense by global warming. However, the latest United Nations climate report in 2014 found "low confidence in a global-scale observed trend in drought or dryness (lack of rainfall) since the middle of the 20th century." The Guardian also noted that federal data showed "a surge in outward migration from western Honduras, a prime coffee-producing area." The collapse in coffee bean prices has made growing it less profitable, forcing migrants to hit the road.

429	thehuffingtonpost	left_bias	2018-04-23	Andrew Cuomo Faces A Big Test On Climate Change. He's Already Failed Twice. And on Monday, 19 buses carrying more than 1,500 activists from across the state converged on the state capital to protest Cuomo's failure to do more about climate change in his eight years in office, and make demands that looked identical to Nixon's platform. It was the largest environmental protest against Cuomo since anti-fracking activists staged demonstrations in 2014. To some, Cuomo's status as a climate pariah may be surprising. In 2014, he put a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for natural gas in the state. In 2015, Al Gore joined the governor as he announced plans to cut the state's greenhouse gases emissions 40 percent by 2030. Last June, Cuomo loudly rejected President Donald Trump's move to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, ramping up New York's pledge to produce half its electricity from renewables by 2030 and forging a new alliance with the governors of Washington and California to stick to the goals agreed to by former President Barack Obama. "Climate change is a reality, and not to address it is gross negligence by government," said Cuomo, according to a new page on the state website with the banner: "Environment Leadership." But Cuomo's policies still fail to meet even the baseline targets scientists say are needed to make a difference on global warming. His reduction targets focus exclusively on power plants, ignoring the majority of the state's emissions that come from buildings and vehicles. He has no plan to get the state to 100 percent renewable electricity, and has offered little to protect low-income communities and neighborhoods of color that suffer most from the impacts of climate change. The state's pension funds remain invested in fossil fuels, and polluters face no penalties in the form of fines on climate-linked damage or taxes on emissions. As Nixon gains in the polls and lands magazine covers, Cuomo is scrambling to act on long-neglected progressive demands. Three weeks ago, over coffee and cookies at a Manhattan steakhouse, the governor made a deal to disband the Independent Democratic Conference, known as the IDC. The group of eight breakaway Democrats in the state Senate caucused with Republicans, guaranteeing a conservative majority in the chamber ― now only one holdout, Brooklyn Democrat Simcha Felder, has left Republicans with a flimsy one-vote majority. Cuomo also signed an executive order last week restoring voting rights to felons on parole and voiced support for legalizing recreational marijuana, a policy Nixon made a platform issue in her campaign. On Friday, almost simultaneous to the release of Nixon's climate platform, Cuomo denied a water quality permit to a new natural gas pipeline environmentalists have protested for months, and announced a new energy efficiency initiative that would account for one-third of the emissions cuts required to meet his 2030 target. But Cuomo's next big test on climate change is one he has already failed twice. For the third time in as many years, the state assembly is slated to vote this week on the latest version of the New York State Climate and Community Protection Act, known as the CCPA. The bill is widely considered the most ambitious and egalitarian climate legislation introduced anywhere in the nation. Heather McGhee, president of the left-leaning think tank Demos, and the economist Robert Reich called it "the most progressive climate-equity policy we've seen." The legislation, first introduced in 2016, calls for 100 percent renewable energy statewide by 2050 and orders state agencies to draft plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, buildings and vehicles. It requires 40 percent of state energy funding to go to the low-income neighborhoods and communities of color most vulnerable to sea level rise and extreme weather, and includes wage standards backed by labor unions for all state-funded green energy projects. If enacted, the bill's proponents say it would create more than 100,000 jobs. For Assemblyman Steve Englebright, the Long Island Democrat who first introduced the CCPA, the bill is 20 years overdue. The 71-year-old lawmaker from Setauket, a coastal hamlet on Long Island Sound, started warning about the threat of runaway global warming two decades ago. He has since sponsored several bills to support solar and wind production, at least three of which became laws. In 2016, he became chairman of the Assembly Committee on Environmental Conservation and moved swiftly to draft and introduce the CCPA." here needs to be some adjustments made in the perception of how important this bill is to bring it into the executive chamber, ready for the governor's signature," Englebright said Friday. "If we can get it onto his desk, he'll have no choice but to sign it." New Yorkers overwhelmingly support environmental regulations even at an economic cost. Seventy-one percent of New Yorkers support expanding renewable energy generation even if it raises electricity prices, compared to 61 percent nationwide, according to Cooperative Congressional Election Study's 2016 survey results analyzed for HuffPost by Data for Progress, a left-leaning think tank. That support cuts across demographics, including 75 percent of people aged 18 to 29 and 67 percent of people 65 years and older; 73 percent of urban dwellers and 67 percent of rural New Yorkers; and 74 percent of black people and 69 percent of whites. Sixty-seven percent of New Yorkers support strengthening enforcement of clean air and water regulations even if it costs U.S. jobs, compared to 58 percent nationwide. The support breaks down similarly across the state, with 73 percent of people aged 18 to 29 and 61 percent of people 65 and older; 71 percent of urbanites and 60 percent of rural people; and 75 percent of black people and 64 percent of whites.

431	shareblue	left_bias	2018-10-14	Marco Rubio lies about climate science while Florida drowns After Florida was hit by the devastating Hurricane Michael this week, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) made it clear he would rather lie about climate change, which makes these storms worse, than commit to doing anything to stop it. On Sunday morning's edition of CNN's "State of the Union," host Jake Tapper pressed Rubio about the recent United Nations report on climate change, which predicts global catastrophe if carbon emissions are not cut dramatically in the next 12 years." o you believe [climate change] is, at least in part, man-made?" Tapper asked. Rubio said that while scientists agree that human behavior is "contributing" to climate change, "I can't tell you what percentage of that is due to human activity." He also claimed that "many scientists" would "debate the percentage of what is attributable to man, versus normal fluctuations." No matter what we do with laws — let's say we went to all solar panels and did all that stuff, which is not realistic — this trend [of sea-level rise] would still continue," Rubio said. Instead of clean energy or reducing emissions, Rubio said he is focused on "strategies to mitigate those factors that are going be in place no matter what happens with our energy policy." But, he added, "I'm also not going to destroy our economy." Almost every word out of Rubio's mouth was either a lie or a shameful dodge. There is overwhelming scientific consensus, including from the United States government, that human activity is the main driver of climate change. There is no "debate" among scientists about this. Human society is overwhelmingly responsible for our warming planet. That's why it makes no sense to quibble, as Rubio does, about exactly what "percentage" of climate change is caused by humans. No matter what, the answer is "most or all of it." And contrary to Rubio's assertions, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report says that drastic reductions in carbon emissions could, in fact, prevent the most catastrophic effects of climate change. The report says that in order to avoid irreversible global warming, "Global net human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) would need to fall by about 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching 'net zero' around 2050." Reducing our carbon emissions will also reduce the effects of climate change. It's as simple as that. But Rubio apparently wants to throw up his hands and claim that since rising seas will drown Florida no matter what, all we can really do is strengthen levies or lift up roads and buildings. Rubio also seems to think that reducing carbon emissions would do more to "destroy our economy" than, say, allowing 1 million Florida homes to flood by the end of this century. Unfortunately, Republicans like Rubio have joined Trump in ignoring science, and doing everything they can to keep pumping as much carbon into the atmosphere as they can get away with. Americans deserve leaders who will do everything they can to prevent the catastrophic effects of climate change, instead of waffling and lying about it like Rubio.

(AP) — A stinking trainload of human waste from New York City is stranded in a tiny Alabama town, spreading a stench like a giant backed-up toilet — and the "poop train" is just the latest example of the South being used as a dumping ground for other states' waste. In Parrish, Alabama, population 982, the sludge-hauling train cars have sat idle near the little league ball fields for more than two months, Mayor Heather Hall said. The smell is unbearable, especially around dusk after the atmosphere has become heated, she said." h my goodness, it's just a nightmare here," she said. "It smells like rotting corpses, or carcasses. It smells like death." All kinds of waste have been dumped in Georgia, Alabama and other Southern states in recent years, including toxic coal ash from power plants around the nation. In South Carolina, a plan to store radioactive nuclear waste in a rural area prompted complaints that the state was being turned into a nuclear dump. In Parrish, townspeople are considering rescheduling children's softball games, or playing at fields in other communities to escape the stink. Sherleen Pike, who lives about a half-mile from the railroad track, said she sometimes dabs peppermint oil under her nose because the smell is so bad." ould New York City like for us to send all our poop up there forever?" she said. "They don't want to dump it in their rivers, but I think each state should take care of their own waste." Alabama's inexpensive land and permissive zoning laws and a federal ban on dumping New Yorkers' excrement in the ocean got the poop train chugging, experts say. Nelson Brooke of the environmental group Black Warrior Riverkeeper, describes Alabama as "kind of an open-door, rubber-stamp permitting place" for landfill operators." t's easy for them to zip into a rural or poor community and set up shop and start making a ton of cash," he said. The poop train's cargo is bound for the Big Sky landfill, about 20 miles (30 kilometers) east of Parrish. The landfill has been accepting the New York sewage sludge since early 2017. Previously, it was transferred from trains to trucks in nearby West Jefferson, but officials there obtained an injunction to keep the sludge out of their town. The sludge "smells of dead rotting animals as well as human waste," West Jefferson's attorney said in a lawsuit against Big Sky Environmental LLC. It also caused the community to become "infested with flies," the complaint states. After West Jefferson went to court, the train stopped in late January in Parrish, which lacks the zoning regulations to block the train cars. It's sat there ever since." e're probably going to look at creating some simple zoning laws for the town of Parrish so we can be sure something like this does not happen again," the Parrish mayor said. Hall said she's optimistic the sludge will all be trucked to the landfill soon. New York City has discontinued shipping it to Alabama for the time being, said Eric Timbers, a city spokesman. Its waste, recovered from the sewage treatment process and often called "biosolids," has been sent out of state partly because the federal government in the late 1980s banned disposal in the Atlantic Ocean. In an earlier trash saga, a barge laden with 3,186 tons (2,890 metric tons) of non-toxic paper and commercial garbage from Long Island and New York City wandered the ocean for months in 1987, seeking a place to dump it after plans by a private developer to turn it into methane gas in North Carolina fell through. It was turned away by North Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Florida, Mexico, Belize and the Bahamas. Brooke's Black Warrior Riverkeeper group last year opposed continued permits for the Big Sky landfill. Rural parts of Alabama are "prime targets" for landfills that accept out-of-state waste, it argued, meaning "that Alabama was becoming a dumping ground for the rest of the nation." Big Sky officials did not return multiple email and phone messages from The Associated Press seeking comment. Nationally, the waste and recycling industry generates more than $93 billion in gross revenue annually, said Brandon Wright, a spokesman for the National Waste & Recycling Association. Wright said there are many reasons waste is sometimes transported out of state. There might not be enough landfill space nearby "and the waste has to go somewhere, so it gets transported out of state," he said. Alabama and other Southern states have a long history accepting waste from around the U.S.A former state attorney general once described a giant west Alabama landfill as "America's Pay Toilet." It was among the nation's largest hazardous waste dumps when it opened in 1977. At its peak, the landfill took in nearly 800,000 tons (72,570 metric tons) of hazardous waste annually. Plans to dump coal ash in Southern states have been particularly contentious. Each year, U.S. coal plants produce about 100 million tons (90 metric tons) of coal ash and other waste; more than 4 million tons of it wound up in an Alabama landfill following a 2008 spill in Tennessee. In Parrish, the mayor hopes the material in the train cars is removed before the weather warms up." e're moving into the summer, and the summer in the South is not forgiving when it comes to stuff like this," she said.

If completed, it would be the first freshwater offshore wind farm on the continent. Supporters point out the project would create more than 500 jobs and pump millions into the local economy over the turbines' 25-year lifespan. Lake Erie Energy Development Corporation, the company behind the project, also argues it would be a step forward for environmentally friendly energy production. However, not every ecologically minded group is on board with Icebreaker, the name of the project. The Black Swamp Bird Observatory and the American Bird Conservancy — two different bird conservation groups — are opposed to the proposal, claiming the turbines would harm the local bird population and that major errors were made during an environmental assessment. (RELATED: Disposal Of Wind Turbines Proving To Be A Major Environmental Concern)"We reject the [environmental assessment's] claim that this wind energy facility would have 'little to no impact'" on birds, Kimberly Kaufman, Black Swamp Bird Observatory's executive director, said in a statement." he six-turbine Icebreaker project poses a larger threat to wildlife than is now indicated in the documents," Kaufman continued. "But the planned expansion of offshore wind energy to over 1,000 turbines will have even more major impacts to birds that breed and migrate across Lake Erie, and that must be addressed." The bird conservancy groups point out that "vast numbers" of migratory birds and bats have been recorded just a few miles from the Great Lakes shorelines, with many flying at the same level of the rotor-swept area of windmills. They submitted their concerns to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Energy.A second public hearing about Icebreaker will take place Thursday at Cleveland City Council. This is far from the first time bird advocates have lamented over wind turbines. Wind farms across the globe kill thousands of birds a year that inadvertently fly into their turbines. Offshore wind farms, while also posing a threat to birds, can also harm the local aquatic ecosystem.

882	RT	questionable_source	2017-08-23	Alaska's thawing permafrost could be gone in decades – study The permafrost that covers great swaths of Siberia, northern Canada, Alaska and Greenland is warming twice as fast as other parts of the planet and could be gone by midcentury, causing more warming and releasing gigatonnes of carbon dioxide and methane." That] has all kind of consequences both locally for this region, for the animals and the people who live here, as well as globally," Max Holmes, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center who is studying the permafrost in Alaska, told the New York Times. As global temperatures rise, scientists are trying to determine the likely speed and scale of the melting of Alaska's permafrost. In geology, permafrost is a thick subsurface layer of soil that remains frozen throughout the year. Located in high latitudes, it covers about 24 percent of the land surface in the northern hemisphere, and can be up to 1km thick. Some of the permafrost dates back to the last Ice Age. Most of this area is found in Siberia, northern Canada, Alaska and Greenland. Permafrost is thought to contain about twice as much carbon dioxide and methane as is currently in the atmosphere. When permafrost melts, microbes convert carbon to carbon dioxide, causing even more warming. Scientists estimate the thawing could contribute as much as 1.7F (1C) to global warming over the next several centuries, regardless of what nations do to reduce emissions from burning fossil fuels and other activities. Holmes led a team of scientists in July to take permafrost cores, sediment and water samples from the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge to better understand how thawing permafrost affects the landscape, and how much and what mix of greenhouse gases are released." n order to know how much is lost, you have to know how much is there," Sue Natali, a Woods Hole scientist and permafrost expert told the New York Times. Vladimir Romanovsky, a permafrost researcher with the University of Alaska, Fairbanks said the temperatures at a depth of 65ft have risen to 5.5F (-3C) over decades." inus 3 is not that far from zero," Dr. Romanovsky told the New York Times. He estimates that if emissions and warming continue at the same rate, near-surface temperatures will rise above freezing around the middle of the century. In 2013, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected that temperature increases in Alaska and northern Russia could reduce permafrost by between 37 and 87 percent by the end of this century. If that occurs, it could potentially leak 1,700 gigatonnes of carbon and methane – twice what is already in the atmosphere.A global temperature rise of 2.7F (1.5C) above current levels would be enough to start the thawing of the permafrost in Siberia, according to scientists from the earth sciences depart at Oxford University in a report published in Science Express in 2016.

The demonstration took place the same day that new members of Congress, including Ocasio-Cortez, arrived for orientation." hey asked me to join them, and I did," Ocasio-Cortez tweeted of her involvement with members of the Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats who visited several elected officials' offices in the building. "We can embrace the energy of activism to move our party's goals forward." Pelosi's office, in a statement shared by Ocasio-Cortez on Twitter, expressed support for the activists and said that she has recommended reinstating the Select Committee on Climate Change, a special climate change committee that was dissolved by Republicans in 2011." ouse Democrats ran on and won on our bold campaign for a $1 trillion investment in our infrastructure that will make our communities more resilient to the climate crisis, while creating 16 million new good-paying jobs across the country," Pelosi's statement read. "We welcome the presence of these activists, and we strongly urge the Capitol Police to allow them to continue to organize and participate in our democracy." California is burning. Fossil fuel billionaires have a grip on America's democracy. We're running out of time to act. But we're going to win. We'll pass a #GreenNewDeal & win the solutions we need.

The group urged her to "step aside" if she is unable to mandate such a plan. Ocasio-Cortez added that she supports Pelosi reinstating the Select Committee and highlighted the activists' requests that the committee draft a Green New Deal calling for 100 percent renewable energy and a commitment from the committee's appointed members that they won't accept funding from the fossil fuel industry.

810	The Guardian	left_center_bias	2017-08-07	US federal department is censoring use of term 'climate change', emails reveal Staff at the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) have been told to avoid using the term climate change in their work, with the officials instructed to reference "weather extremes" instead.A series of emails obtained by the Guardian between staff at the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), a USDA unit that oversees farmers' land conservation, show that the incoming Trump administration has had a stark impact on the language used by some federal employees around climate change.A missive from Bianca Moebius-Clune, director of soil health, lists terms that should be avoided by staff and those that should replace them. "Climate change" is in the "avoid" category, to be replaced by "weather extremes". Instead of "climate change adaption", staff are asked to use "resilience to weather extremes". The primary cause of human-driven climate change is also targeted, with the term "reduce greenhouse gases" blacklisted in favor of "build soil organic matter, increase nutrient use efficiency". Meanwhile, "sequester carbon" is ruled out and replaced by "build soil organic matter". In her email to staff, dated 16 February this year, Moebius-Clune said the new language was given to her staff and suggests it be passed on. She writes that "we won't change the modeling, just how we talk about it – there are a lot of benefits to putting carbon back in the sail [sic], climate mitigation is just one of them", and that a colleague from USDA's public affairs team gave advice to "tamp down on discretionary messaging right now". In contrast to these newly contentious climate terms, Moebius-Clune wrote that references to economic growth, emerging business opportunities in the rural US, agro-tourism and "improved aesthetics" should be "tolerated if not appreciated by all". In a separate email to senior employees on 24 January, just days after Trump's inauguration, Jimmy Bramblett, deputy chief for programs at the NRCS, said: "It has become clear one of the previous administration's priority is not consistent with that of the incoming administration. Namely, that priority is climate change. Please visit with your staff and make them aware of this shift in perspective within the executive branch." Bramblett added that "prudence" should be used when discussing greenhouse gases and said the agency's work on air quality regarding these gases could be discontinued. Other emails show the often agonized discussions between staff unsure of what is forbidden. On 16 February, a staffer named Tim Hafner write to Bramblett: "I would like to know correct terms I should use instead of climate changes and anything to do with carbon ... I want to ensure to incorporate correct terminology that the agency has approved to use." On 5 April, Suzanne Baker, a New York-based NRCS employee, emailed a query as to whether staff are "allowed to publish work from outside the USDA that use 'climate change'". A colleague advises that the issue be determined in a phone call. Some staff weren't enamored with the new regime, with one employee stating on an email on 5 July that "we would prefer to keep the language as is" and stressing the need to maintain the "scientific integrity of the work". In a statement, USDA said that on 23 January it had issued "interim operating procedures outlining procedures to ensure the new policy team has an opportunity to review policy-related statements, legislation, budgets and regulations prior to issuance". The statement added: "This guidance, similar to procedures issued by previous administrations, was misinterpreted by some to cover data and scientific publications. This was never the case and USDA interim procedures will allow complete, objective information for the new policy staff reviewing policy decisions." Kaveh Sadeghzadeh of the Natural Resources Conservation Service added that his organisation "has not received direction from USDA or the administration to modify its communications on climate change or any other topic". Trump has repeatedly questioned the veracity of climate change research, infamously suggesting that it is part of an elaborate Chinese hoax. The president has started the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris climate agreement, has instructed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to scrap or amend various regulations aimed at cutting greenhouse gases, and has moved to open up more public land and waters to fossil fuel activity. The nomenclature of the federal government has also shifted as these new priorities have taken hold. Mentions of the dangers of climate change have been removed from the websites of the White House and the Department of the Interior, while the EPA scrapped its entire online climate section in April pending a review that will be "updating language to reflect the approach of new leadership"." hese records reveal Trump's active censorship of science in the name of his political agenda," said Meg Townsend, open government attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity." o think that federal agency staff who report about the air, water and soil that sustains the health of our nation must conform their reporting with the Trump administration's anti-science rhetoric is appalling and dangerous for America and the greater global community." The Center for Biological Diversity is currently suing several government agencies, including the EPA and state department, to force them to release information on the "censoring" of climate change verbiage. While some of the changes to government websites may have occurred anyway, the emails from within the USDA are the clearest indication yet that staff have been instructed to steer clear of acknowledging climate change or its myriad consequences. US agriculture is a major source of heat-trapping gases, with 15% of the country's emissions deriving from farming practices. A USDA plan to address the "far reaching" impacts of climate change is still online. However, Sam Clovis, Trump's nomination to be the USDA's chief scientist, has labeled climate research "junk science". Last week it was revealed that Clovis, who is not a scientist, once ran a blog where he called progressives "race traders and race 'traitors'" and likened Barack Obama to a "communist".

770	BBC	left_center_bias	2017-05-12	Arctic summit: Trump to make 'right decision for the US' on climate The US will consider its interests first as it reviews its climate change policy, the secretary of state says. Rex Tillerson told a meeting of the eight Arctic nations in Alaska that the US would not rush to make a decision and would consider their views. President Donald Trump has expressed doubts over the human role in climate change and has said he may pull the US out of the Paris Accord to fight it. Meanwhile, other Arctic countries have called for a cut on greenhouse gases. They signed an agreement which stated there was a need for urgent global action. Climate change was the biggest issue at the biennial meeting of the Arctic Council in Fairbanks, which was overshadowed by the uncertainties over Mr Trump's policy. Mr Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, told the meeting that the administration was reviewing how it would approach climate change." We are appreciative that each of you has an important point of view, and you should know that we are taking the time to understand your concerns," he said." We're not going to rush to make a decision. We're going to work to make the right decision for the United States." Mr Trump is to decide whether the US will leave or reduce its commitments to the Paris agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which was negotiated by around 200 nations and signed in 2015. An announcement is expected after a trip to Europe later this month. The joint agreement by the Arctic Council mentioned the Paris accord only in a passing reference, which noted the deal's entry into force and implementation. But the text did not recommit its members to meet the pledges made. Some climate scientists here in Alaska say they are pleasantly surprised by the relatively tough language on climate change adopted by all eight Arctic Council nations including the United States. The thrust of the text, argues Prof John Walsh, chief scientist at the University of Alaska's International Arctic Research Center, actually echoes the approach of the Obama administration. The acceptance of the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gases (such as methane and carbon dioxide) and pollutants (like black carbon and aerosols) appears significant. But a couple of things are missing. Although the logic of the statement insists that human activity is causing climate change, the word "human" is not actually present. Nor is there a commitment to implement the landmark Paris accord, an omission which is causing alarm among environmentalists. Not only that, but many of the Trump administration's early policy decisions prioritised economic growth over environmental protection, and Mr Tillerson continues to insist that American climate policy remains under review. So, in short, it is far too early to conclude that the White House has suddenly been persuaded by mainstream scientific opinion on global warming - and with US politics in astonishing flux, the Fairbanks Declaration may be no more than a holding statement.

9	foxnews	right_bias	2019-04-03	GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz unveils 'Green Real Deal,' as conservative answer to AOC pet project Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz unveiled the "Green Real Deal" on Wednesday as a free-market counterproposal to the Green New Deal being pushed by Democrats to combat climate change." he question for America is pretty simple: either we want a bunch of bureaucrats in Washington telling us what we can't do, or we empower American innovators to unlock things that we can do," the Florida congressman said at a press conference in front of the Capitol building. AOC MOCKS CRITICS OF GREEN NEW DEAL'S ESTIMATED $93 TRILLION PRICE TAG: 'THEY SOUND LIKE DR. EVIL'His plan, which he is putting forward in a House resolution, involves a number of planks including revisiting global trade and intellectual property policies to create "an international marketplace fair to American innovators." Gaetz's plan also aims to modernize the electric grid, which he says currently "functions as a wet blanket over American innovation." Gaetz claims that upgrading the grid will create an "entire class of energy entrepreneurs across the country." He also wants to "unlock federal lands" from current regulations, saying they can be "an open canvas" for renewable energy research, testing and evaluation. The plan comes in response to the Green New Deal, a once-fringe policy that seeks to overhaul the nation's economy and energy use to combat climate change and combat income inequality. But this year it has emerged in the Democratic mainstream, with a resolution introduced in the House and support from most major 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. However, a test vote on the proposal recently failed in the Senate with no senator voting to begin debate on the legislation. The proposal includes a host of costly and controversial big-government programs -- including a push for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, universal health care and job guarantee programs. In the press conference, Gaetz made references to FAQs released by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's, D-N.Y., office that said the deal aims to "upgrade or replace every building" for energy efficiency and render air travel unnecessary, while joking about getting rid of "farting cows." Do we really believe that if we outlaw cars, cows, planes and buildings that the rest of the world will follow?" he said. "Of course not, they will laugh at us." While Gaetz's proposal consists of free-market and small-government ideas of the kind Republicans have long embraced, the plan is a notable shift for the party toward tackling climate change in some fashion. Traditionally, Republicans have been more skeptical about man's influence on the climate. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler was asked in January at his confirmation hearing if he believed warnings from scientists about the threats of climate change."  would not call it the greatest crisis, no" he said. In an indication of likely conservative opposition to Gaetz's plan, advocacy group FreedomWorks issued a statement calling it a "sad example of Republicans thinking they're conservatives by being slightly to the right of far left." What's more, it is presented as a collection of bold, new ideas yet most of them are policies and programs that exist and aren't working. This is perhaps the only thing 'real' about the 'Green Real Deal,'" the statement said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPGaetz said at the press conference that he doesn't think the EPA has done a good job of combating climate change and said he wants to shift the debate among Republicans -- from focusing on the existence of climate change, to how to combat it."I didn't come to Congress to argue with a thermometer and I think that more of my colleagues need to realize that the science of global warming is irrefutable," he said.

332	thedailycaller	right_bias	2018-07-31	Federal Judge Puts The Final Nail In The Coffin Of California's Climate Crusade A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit Friday targeting ExxonMobil on the basis that two California cities waging a legal battle could not prove the energy company was responsible for climate change in the state. District Judge William Alsup wrote that San Francisco and Oakland failed to prove that global warming would be substantially curtailed if the oil company did not operate inside California. His decision follows a ruling the judge made in June dismissing both cases on the grounds that Congress, not the court system, is responsible for addressing the emission of greenhouse gasses." t is manifest that global warming would have continued in the absence of all California-related activities of defendants," Alsup wrote in his July 27 decision. "Plaintiffs have therefore failed to adequately link each defendants' alleged California activities to plaintiffs' harm." Cities in Colorado, Rhode Island, and New York have also filed similar lawsuits against energy producers over the past year. They argue that Exxon and others should pony-up money for mitigation efforts designed to forestall the effects from climate change. Many of the lawsuits have already been nixed. Alsup also suggested that climate change would be no better or worse even if Exxon were not operating in California." rom all that appears in the amended complaints, however, this worldwide chain of events (Exxon's oil production) does not depend on a particular defendant's contacts with California," he said. "Whatever sales or events occurred in California were causally insignificant in the context of the worldwide conduct leading to the international problem of global warming." Trial lawyers with Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP handled climate lawsuits on behalf of the two California cities and New York City in exchange for a percentage of any winnings, called a contingency fee. (RELATED: Trial Lawyers Handling Cities' Global Warming Lawsuits Stand To Make Billions)Hagens Berman stood to earn billions of dollars in contingency fees depending on the total winnings, from a favorable judgement against oil companies. The three cities claimed billions of dollars-worth of damage from global warming induced by fossil fuels.	True	False	True	False	True
371	thedailycaller	right_bias	2018-11-27	'Not Based On Facts': Sarah Sanders Pushes Back Against New Climate Report White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders dismissed a major White House climate change report that some have used to criticize President Donald Trump's position on global warming. The report is "not based on facts," Sanders told reporters during a press conference Tuesday. She also argued that climate modeling of the kind researchers used in the National Climate Assessment report "is never exact." We think that this is the most extreme version and it's not based on facts," she said. "It's not data driven. We'd like to see something that is more data driven. It's based on modeling, which is extremely hard to do when you're talking about the climate." The NCA report came from a team of 13 federal agencies and was cobbled together with the help of 300 scientists. They used a Representative Concentration Pathway adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) fifth Assessment Report (AR5) to make their conclusions. Continued use of coal and other fossil fuels will eliminate 10 percent of the GDP by 2100, according to the report. The country will also be 3 to 12 degrees hotter depending on the level of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere, the report warns. It also suggests wildfires and hurricanes will increase as a result if the risk is left unchecked. The report is not without its controversies. One climate expert argues researchers used an unreliable climate model. University of Colorado Prof. Roger Pielke Jr., for instance, criticized the researchers in a series of tweets Saturday for basing their modeling on a data that are likely to change dramatically over the course of the next 80 years. He says the NCA's second volume relies on the RCP8.5, one of the four possible pathways in the trajectory. (RELATED: A Top-Line Claim In The Newest US Climate Report Relies On Research Tied To Major Democratic Donors)This particular pathway is slowly being phased out of the IPCC's modeling because scientists believe the model likely overestimates future supply of fossil fuels. Researchers used the most extreme example possible to sell the narrative that wildfires will get worse, Pielke noted. He has criticized the media's handling of similar reports. NCA's dire prediction of a 10 percent hit to U.S. GDP comes from a 2017 study supported by the charitable foundations founded by major Democratic donors. The study was also funded by other organizations, including the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Department of Energy and the Skoll Global Threats Fund.

227	thenewyorktimes	left_center_bias	2019-03-01	Jay Inslee on the Issues His environmental policy record in his home state is long. In 2015, he ordered Washington's Department of Ecology to impose a cap on carbon emissions. He created a fund for clean energy, and the state now has extensive solar energy infrastructure and electric buses. While economic damage is a concern for opponents of limiting fossil fuels, Washington had the highest G.D.P. growth in the nation in 2018, according to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. Mr. Inslee also tried unsuccessfully last year to get the Washington Legislature to vote on a carbon tax, which would have been the first in the nation; voters rejected the proposal in November. He then proposed a different series of actions, including running the state's electric utilities fully on renewable power by 2045, requiring buildings to be more energy efficient, promoting electric vehicles and cutting down on hydrofluorocarbons, which are used in air-conditioners. Hydrofluorocarbon emissions have been growing faster than any other form of greenhouse gas emissions. In an op-ed in The Washington Post, Mr. Inslee called for net-zero carbon emissions nationwide by 2050 — a longer timeline than the Green New Deal's 10 years, which experts say is unrealistic. ("Net-zero" could mean either eliminating carbon emissions altogether, or reducing them and using offsetting technologies to cancel out the rest.) He also called for a "100 percent clean-energy grid" and "massive investments" to transition buildings, industries and transportation to renewable sources. While Mr. Inslee has made clear that he intends to focus overwhelmingly on climate change, he is on the record supporting liberal policies in many other areas.• He has been outspoken in favor of gun control, and after the shooting in Parkland, Fla., last year, he confronted President Trump on live television, denouncing Mr. Trump's suggestion to arm schoolteachers. Among other measures, he wants to expand background checks and restrict some semiautomatic weapons. His advocacy on the issue goes back many years; he lost his seat in Congress after voting for the 1994 assault weapons ban.	False	False	False	False	False
76	drudgereport	right_bias	2019-09-19	Solar panels, vegan diets, no flights: 'Warming' revolutionaries... The last time Californian climate scientist Peter Kalmus was on an airplane was in 2012: He says it made him feel physically sick and like he was "stealing" from his children's future, and vowed never to fly again. US President Donald Trump's administration has made no secret of its disdain for climate science, but that hasn't stopped some ordinary Americans from finding ways to drastically reduce their own carbon footprints, hoping to persuade others through their examples. Kalmus was pursuing his post-doctoral studies in 2009 when he became increasingly concerned about the prospect of climate breakdown, tipping points such as the thawing of the Earth's permafrost triggering runaway global warming that wreaks havoc on weather systems. "I was shaking people by the lapels, posting screeds on Facebook, not really getting anywhere," he told AFP in an interview from his home in a Los Angeles suburb. "Eventually, it dawned on me that I should maybe bring my actions into alignment with my beliefs." Drawing upon his expertise as a scientist, he calculated the emissions associated with various aspects of his life and was surprised to learn that electricity consumption made up a tiny portion compared to air travel. "So I started focusing on flying less. I tried being a vegetarian for a month, and I liked it better," he said, quickly realizing that, rather than feeling like sacrifices, the changes he made were improving his sense of wellbeing. Some people, like Tarek Maassarani, take their philosophy to what others may see as extremes. The bespectacled 40-year-old with long blond hair does paid consulting for the United States Institute of Peace and is an adjunct professor at two Washington universities, but performs the bulk of his work in the volunteer sector. Two years ago, he moved out of a co-housing community in a Washington suburb when his two sons shifted to Utah to live with their mother, and has been living between friends' houses ever since. Apart from relying almost exclusively on his bicycle for transport, including deep into winter, Maassarani is focused on avoiding buying new products because of the energy-intensive nature of their production. He instead depends on hand-me-downs, "and I sort of extend the life of things well past what most people would do," finding ways to keep tatty decade-old cell phones and laptops going. He gets much of his food from dumpster diving or from the leftovers at buffets from conferences he attends, describing himself as a "supply-and-demand vegan." What this means is "I don't buy any animal products, I try not to create any demand signal for animal products," he said. At the same time, if meat is all that is left when he rummages through garbage or approaches buffets (he makes it a point to go last), he will consume it. Maassarani is quick to admit that his case falls well outside what most people could envisage and is made possible only by living in what he calls a "consumption excessive society." "I'm aware of course that if the excesses weren't there, it wouldn't work, but then again the problem wouldn't be there." Others, like Elizabeth Hogan, lead more conventional lives but are still re-orienting themselves toward more carbon neutrality. Hogan, who works as a consultant on mitigating the impact of ocean plastics on marine life, just outfitted solar panels on the roof of her home in Washington. She and her husband estimate these will account for 80 percent of their energy needs, with the balance coming from wind power bought at a premium from their electric provider. "Both of our careers are very planet-oriented, so it's kind of our whole lives, but I am certainly not claiming to be perfect," she says, conceding that they both fly extensively for work. Her love of cheese means she's a vegetarian, rather than a vegan, but sources her dairy from a nearby local farm that cleans and re-uses glass bottles returned to them. But how impactful can individual action be, in the absence of systemic changes from the top? After all, the United States' current climate commitments are rated by Climate Action Tracker as "critically insufficient" in meeting the goal of limiting long-term warming to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Kalmus, who has written a book on his experiences, said meeting critical goals to avert disaster will require a "rapid cultural transformation," and acts of individual defiance help achieve that. "The reason everyone's waking up is because there's been this massive grassroots shift over the last year or two," he said, citing the global youth movement for climate action. One of the many ways people can contribute to that movement is by telling others about steps they have personally taken, "then when you say 'this is really urgent,' your words are backed by the truth of your actions."

866	RT	questionable_source	2017-08-30	Texas air pollution sensors switched off as refineries seep toxic chemicals into air & water US crude oil and petrochemical refining capacity in Texas has been severely damaged by Hurricane Harvey, releasing hazardous pollutants into the air and flood waters left in the wake of the storm. Arkema, a global chemical major, warned Wednesday that flooding has severely damaged their Houston plant's refrigeration systems, increasing the likelihood of an explosion in the coming week and a heightened risk of yet more pollutants leaking into the ecosystem." t this time, while we do not believe there is any imminent danger, the potential for a chemical reaction leading to a fire and/or explosion within the site confines is real," Arkema said in a statement. Oil giant Exxon Mobil is among the companies to report incidents of emissions released at its refineries as a result of the hurricane which ransacked coastal parts of Texas and caused widespread flooding in the country's fourth biggest city, Houston. However, the true extent of the air pollution will prove hard to determine for some time after the storm subsides as The Texas Council on Environmental Quality shut down all of its air quality monitors in the Houston area, according to the Houston Press. This effectively means the affected companies can report whatever they wish without any oversight from the state regulators. Texas is also home to several so-called superfund sites, designated areas of extreme pollution "which warrant further investigation" according to the Environmental Protection Agency. As shown in the before and after maps below, the vast majority of these toxic sites are now flooded in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. On Wednesday, Saudi-owned Motiva shuttered its refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, the largest facility in the US, which normally produces 600,000 barrels a day. At least 13 other refineries in the area closed as a result of Harvey, the US Department of Energy reported, while others are operating at limited capacity. Exxon admitted there were issues at its plants in a regulatory filing to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Its Baytown refinery near Houston, the second-largest in the country, was shutdown on Sunday as Harvey moved inland. The refinery reported two controlled emission release events, which included carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and benzene being released into the atmosphere. The chemicals and pollutants released from refineries and plants in Texas' petrochemical hub are known to have a damaging effect on the environment and could pose a risk of contaminating floodwaters left in the hurricane's wake. The petrochemical Benzene, a carcinogen and major component in fossil fuels, reduces red and white blood cell production and decreases auto-immune cell function following prolonged exposure. While other emissions, including, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are particle-forming air pollutants that contribute to cardiopulmonary health issues, like lung cancer, bronchitis and emphysema. In a third reported incident since Harvey made landfall in Texas, Exxon said a floating roof over a tank in its Baytown refinery sank as a result of the rain, causing unusually high levels of emissions to be released. Floating roofs are common in oil tanks and are a way to control how much oil is lost to evaporation by allowing the roof to move based on the amount of liquid in the tank. Exxon said it would "conduct an assessment to determine the impact of the storm once it's safe to do so," the Washington Post reports. The company said it needed to make repairs on the tank, which would involve first emptying it, though Exxon could not confirm in what time frame. One of the company's other facilities, in Beaumont, east of Houston, also released 1,300lbs of sulphur dioxide in one hour on Sunday, exceeding its allocated emissions limit by a factor of ten to one." xcess emissions occurred during an upset on the Sulfur Plant Thermal Oxidizer," Exxon said in the report." he unit was stabilized. No impact to the community has been reported," the company said. "Actions were taken to minimize emissions and to restore the refinery to normal operations." Petrochemical giant Chevron Phillips reported an estimated 776,000 pounds of combined chemicals released from its Cedar Bayou plant in Baytown as part of its plant shutdown. Kinder Morgan, the largest energy infrastructure company in North America, stores petroleum products for companies such as Chevron and Shell at its terminal in Pasadena, Harris. It reported 394,000 pounds of combined hazardous chemicals on Sunday and Monday, also as a result of a malfunctioning floating roof. In this case, it caused product to spill to the ground. Kinder Morgan said it will "attempt to safely land roof of Tank 150-39 and remove product when conditions are safe." It added it was "taking all necessary steps to prevent or minimize any increased risk to human health and safety and to the environment." Almost one third of US oil refining capacity is located on the Gulf Coast. The US produces about 17.5 million barrels of oil per day. According to oil market analysts cited by CNBC, about 20 percent of the country's oil refining operations are out of service. Ships carrying crude oil from the Mexican Gulf are not able to port in the area due to swelling waters caused by Harvey, resulting in a backlog of ships waiting to dock and unload their cargo. The Gulf of Mexico accounts for close to 20 percent of total US crude oil production. CNBC estimates the port closures cost roughly $350 million a day. The port hold-up also affects the amount of crude oil refineries have access to once they return to full operation. Gas prices across the US have already risen to a two-year high, with the increase likely to hit consumers at the pump in a week. It is unknown how long the refineries will remain out of production, as the extent of flood damage is not yet known. Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, refineries in the area didn't return to normal production capacity for two months.	False	False	False	False	True

Activists in the U.S. are making similar demands that are found in Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal: a swift transition to 100 percent renewable energy, a complete abolition of fossil fuels and other environmental mandates. The group strongly references the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 2018 report, which claims the world only has a few year to dramatically reduce carbon emissions or else face dire environmental consequences.

450	thehuffingtonpost	left_bias	2018-05-24	White House Officials Reportedly Considered Just 'Ignoring' New Climate Research The Trump administration spent time last year mulling over what its public position on climate science should be — and, according to a report published Wednesday by The Washington Post, outrightly "ignoring" new research was one option that officials considered. Citing an internal memo drafted in September by President Donald Trump's then-top energy and environmental aide, Michael Catanzaro, the Post reported that White House officials had discussed whether to "consider having a firm position on and a coherent, fact-based message about climate science ― specifically, whether, and to what extent, anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are affecting the climate system, and what level of concern that warrants." Three options were reportedly presented in the memo: The first was to conduct  "red team/blue team" debates to "highlight uncertainties" in climate data; the second was to review scientific studies under the Administrative Procedure Act; and the final option was to simply "ignore, and not seek to characterize or question, the science being conducted by Federal agencies and outside entities." No formal policy ever did materialize from the memo or subsequent discussions on the issue. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt was reportedly an advocate of holding "red team/blue team" debates to publicly critique climate science, but that idea was ultimately blocked by the White House, reported The New York Times in March. As the Post noted, the Catanzaro memo offers a glimpse into the challenges faced by the Trump administration on the issue of climate change. While White House officials continue to publicly downplay climate data and adopt policies to expand fossil fuel production in the U.S., federal agencies have continued to publish research showing that climate change is real, man-made and a growing threat to the U.S. On Friday, for instance, the National Park Service published a report that said the effects of climate change, like rising sea levels and intensifying storms, could damage park sites across the country. The report's lead researcher had earlier accused the Trump administration of attempting to censor the study by removing all mentions of human-caused climate change." gnoring the overwhelming evidence only sets us back further in addressing this serious threat," said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.)." Ignore," distort, or censor. Those are the options the Trump White House is considering to deal with the overwhelming consensus on climate change. Unacceptable and immoral.

516	bbc	left_center_bias	2018-07-20	The cost of Trump's Endangered Species Act proposal The Trump administration has proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), a law credited with keeping hundreds of species from going extinct. The change would eliminate automatic protections for threatened plant and animal species, and make it easier for species to be removed from the list. Wildlife conservation groups say the proposed change could have disastrous lasting effects on at-risk species. Trump officials say the change will streamline the regulatory process. The proposed change is the latest in a series of White House efforts to remove environmental regulations designed to protect vulnerable species and their habitats, as well as leave untouched some of America's most wild places. Environmentalist groups have reacted with outrage, and the Center for Biological Diversity said "these proposals would slam a wrecking ball into the most crucial protections for our most endangered wildlife"." If these regulations had been in place in the 1970s, the bald eagle and the grey whale would be extinct today." The Endangered Species Act was signed into law in 1973 by Republican President Richard Nixon and now protects more than 1,200 plant and animal species. The list of species is maintained by US Fish and Wildlife and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees marine species. It has been credited with reviving bald eagle populations and bringing the Yellowstone grizzly bear back from the edge of extinction. Here are several species that could be affected by the change, or may not currently exist if it was not for the landmark law. Experts agree that arctic sea ice - which polar bears require for fishing and hunting - is shrinking, which is leading to enormous stresses on the world's largest bear species. The proposed change to the ESA includes a narrowing of the definition of "foreseeable future". The US government says they want the language clarified to "make it clear that it extends only as far as [wildlife officials] can reasonably determine that both the future threats and the species' response to those threats are probable". Environmentalists fear the new language will make it possible for government biologists to disregard the long-term effects of climate change on the environment. The polar bear could be emblematic of many species being affected by climate change, says Bob Dreher of the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife. Whether government biologists will recognise "this slow-acting but inevitable change in ecosystem because of climate change" or wait until more evidence is available is unclear, he tells the BBC. The ESA provides blanket protections to species which are categorised as either "threatened" - such as the California gnatcatcher - or "endangered". Endangered species are those likely to go extinct, while threatened species are those likely to become endangered. Under current law, both are granted "critical habitat" protections, but the Trump administration wants automatic protections for threatened species to be eliminated and, in the future, to be considered on a case by case basis. Protections for the California gnatcatcher have barred development across nearly 100,000 acres of land in the Greater Los Angeles area, according to the Los Angeles Times. If not for their current protections, their native habitat would likely become part of more urban sprawl. The sage grouse has been a candidate for protection as a threatened species for nearly a decade, but it is unclear if it will ever be added. They, as well as the dunes sagebrush lizard, have seen their territory encroached upon by human development and have seen decreasing populations in recent years. The distinctive sage grouse return to their breeding grounds, known as Leks, every year. Biologists believe some Leks can be hundreds of years old. If the sage grouse does achieve threatened status, environmentalists fear under the new Trump proposal it would be too late for them to gain the broad protections they need. Although the proposed change would only affect future creatures joining the list, Mr Dreher says that if the proposed rules had been in effect in the 1970s, animals such as wolves and bald eagles may have been extinct by now. In a significant reversal, the proposed change would eliminate language that precludes wildlife experts from considering economic impacts when determining when an organism should be listed. Wolves, which were re-introduced in the lower 48 states, have faced criticism from ranchers and farmers who argue that they have impacted their livelihood by killing their livestock. Re-introducing them to the continental US came at great cost and effort, says Mr Dreher, a former US Fish and Wildlife official. Mr Dreher says that the ESA was designed by Congress to say that "the value of life on earth is priceless" and that politicians should not have to decide whether it is "too expensive" to prevent extinction." If we made those decisions you can see under different administrations we would end up protecting nothing. Because who knows what a snail is worth? Who knows what a frog is worth?"

Carbon fees were once considered an obvious next step in the country's multifaceted effort to reduce CO2 emissions. Congresswoman-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a rising star on the left, believes a carbon tax can be one part of her sweeping "Green New Deal." Some conservatives have signed on to the idea, believing it to be a market-based approach to eliminating pollution. Even a number of major energy companies have come forward in support of charging businesses for the amount of carbon they release into the atmosphere. However, carbon tax proposals have proven unsuccessful time and time again. Initiative 1631, for example, was supposed to serve as a bellwether for how similar legislation could fare across the country. The bill — which called for a $15 fee on each metric ton of carbon emissions — was put to the test in Washington state during the 2018 midterm elections. Despite the state's Democratic lean and the governor's public backing, the measure was soundly rejected in November. It was the second time voters in the state had rejected a carbon fee. Such a proposal being rejected in a blue state doesn't bode well for activists who hope to see it implemented nationwide." f it can't pass in Washington state right now, I'm not sure that says that there's much of a pathway at this moment nationally," Washington Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley said of the outcome. Events across the Atlantic have only worsened prospects for carbon tax supporters. In the face of unprecedented protests, the French government has decided to suspend a planned gas tax. President Emmanuel Macros had originally proposed a slew of new carbon taxes intended to wean consumers off fossil fuels and transition to electric vehicles. The price hikes, however, triggered a wave of intense riots. The protests, which have lasted for weeks, have even become deadly. One man was caught on video over the weekend losing his hand to a grenade explosion." here's been a predominant conversation in Washington, D.C., that's been led by economists and politicos that have tried to frame a carbon tax as the only way," Evan Weber, a national political director for the Sunrise Movement, said to Politico. "It's proved time and time again to be not politically popular, and we haven't even priced the policy at where economists say it needs to be. The idea that [a carbon fee is] the way out of this mess is something we need to be pushing back on." (RELATED: Keep It In The Ground Activists Stormed Trump Administration's Event At UN Meeting)Activists will instead focus on other causes near and dear to the environmental movement, such as pushing energy standards that mandate a total transition to clean and renewable energy. While many have expressed dissolution over the prospect of a carbon tax future, other green activists plan to keep charging forward with their own proposals.

711	The Huffington Post	left_bias	2017-06-26	Don't Be Fooled By The Gentler Tone Of Charles Koch's Climate-Change Denial "Obviously, if the temperature continues to go up, at some point it can be harmful or even very harmful," the billionaire Republican megadonor said during an interview last week on Freakonomics Radio. "But the question is, 'What do we do about it, about whatever risk there is?' And to me, the answer is innovation." On the face of it, that admission may seem like a shift coming from a man who, with his brother David, bankrolled a conservative movement bent on hacking away environmental regulations and helped transform the GOP into the only major political party in the developed world to deny the overwhelming evidence of manmade global warming. But, to scientists, Koch remains a climate pariah who has learned how to temper his message for audiences who don't buy into the view that industry players are somehow more credible than impartial researchers." t's just no longer credible to deny out of hand that climate change is happening or even that it's human-caused," Michael Mann, a climatologist at Penn State University and co-author of a new book on climate change denialism, told HuffPost on Monday. "So the forces of denial ― the special interests, the polluting interests ― have instead turned to a new talking point that they think they might be able to get away with." When you look at all the climate denial arguments, they're basically the flip of all that: It's not real, it's not us, it's not bad, the experts disagree or the experts are unreliable, and there's no hope, we can't fix it," Cook told HuffPost. "You expect them to be moving along that spectrum." But that reasoning ― which sounds measured compared to outright denial of observable phenomena ― has been employed for years to undermine climate science, and does not represent an evolution on the issue. The spectrum of climate science denialism, that argument included, has not changed much over the past two decades, according to a 2015 U.K. study analyzing 16,000 documents from conservative think tanks. The philosophical belief that, left alone, the free market will produce industries and technologies to curb climate change before it becomes catastrophic is flawed. Economist Milton Friedman, the so-called patron saint of laissez faire capitalism who popularized the belief that corporations should pursue profit and shareholder value above all, argued there is little incentive to preserve the environment without some form of government intervention." ou need a price on the emission of carbon if you're going to level the playing field," Mann said. "Even Milton Friedman understood the existence of market externalities, the fact that damage to our environment is not accounted for in the free market without placing some sort of price signal." The most popular solution among economists is putting a tax on carbon emissions. In February, a group of Republican elder statesmen introduced a plan for a $40 carbon tax that would be returned to taxpayers in the form of a carbon dividend. A cadre of oil and gas giants, including Exxon Mobil Corp., endorsed the proposal earlier this month. But the proposition faces dim prospects of becoming law under the Trump administration, which has vowed to pump up the oil, gas and coal industries. Booming U.S. oil production ― bolstered by advancements in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, technology ― has helped keep oil prices low since they plummeted in mid-2014. The price per barrel now hovers just above $40. Without some incentive from policymakers to invest in zero-emissions energy such as wind, solar or hydropower, the world is likely to warm well past 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, by the end of the century. That temperature rise would drastically alter the climate, submerge coastal communities and could create up to 2 billion refugees." oth government policy and low-carbon technological innovations are going to be critical to keeping warming within 2C," James Leaton, research director at the U.K.-based financial think tank Carbon Tracker, told HuffPost by email. "Obviously policy and technology interact and cannot be seen in isolation ― with policy stimulating technological deployment, and rapid roll-out reducing the future level of policy required. Both can impact the relative financial attractiveness of future energy options." These policies that the U.S. government has, others have proposed or promulgated, have been just symbolic," Koch said in the interview. "We oppose all of these because they end up being cronyism. They end up helping certain wealthy people to the disadvantage of the less fortunate." Sometimes, the pot calls the kettle black. But in this case, the kettle is filled with a solution to clean up the greasy mess left behind by the pot. And the pot is a fossil fuel tycoon with a net worth roughly the size of Bulgaria's gross domestic product." t's one thing to be an ignorant fool, but it's quite something else to allow one's malicious ignorance to potentially threaten the entire planet," Mann said. "That is what is so pernicious about [Koch's] continued denial of the threat of climate change, and the extent to which they have been able to pollute our entire political discourse by using their political wealth to confuse the public and policymakers about the reality of this existential threat."

For example, the IPCC's report noted that "there is only low confidence regarding changes in global tropical cyclone numbers under global warming over the last four decades." Pielke pointed out this inconvenient data. Much like the IPCC's 2013 climate assessment, the new special report confirmed what Pielke and others have said for years about the relationship between global warming and extreme weather. But don't expect to hear that from many other media outlets, especially those that often cite individual weather events as evidence of man-made warming. For example, The Washington Post's write-up of the IPCC's report focused on the mainline findings — namely, that "the world is woefully off target" to keep future global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The New York Times highlighted the IPCC's warning of "a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires, and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040." Neither WaPo nor NYT mentioned the report's findings on extreme weather. The IPCC's new report is meant to sound the alarm on global warming ahead of the UN climate summit, which is to be held in Poland this December. Delegates are expected to make further commitments to implement the Paris climate accord that calls for limiting future warming below 2 degrees Celsius by 2100. Aside from dire predictions, however, the IPCC's new report also noted that many types of extreme weather events are not getting worse. (RELATED: It's The Final Chance We Have To Stop Global Warming … Until The Next Chance)When it comes to droughts, for example, the IPCC admits there is "low confidence in the sign of drought trends since 1950 at global scale. The report says there are "likely to be trends in some regions of the world," including increasing droughts in the Mediterranean and decreasing droughts in parts of North America. The IPCC also noted there is "low confidence due to limited evidence, however, that anthropogenic climate change has affected the frequency and the magnitude of floods." The report added that "streamflow trends since 1950 are non-statistically significant in most of the world's largest rivers." However, the report's authors warned that future warming could exacerbate extreme weather and hurt the global economy. The report's authors also claimed extreme weather had already increased, contrary to much of their own evidence." ne of the key messages that comes out very strongly from this report is that we are already seeing the consequences of 1 [degree Celsius] of global warming through more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice, among other changes," Panmao Zhai, an IPCC co-chair, said in a statement issued Sunday.

The one Catholic priest and three Protestant clergy criticized Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.) in an op-ed published by the Missoulian Thursday for failing to understand climate change's role in a widespread fish kill in Yellowstone National Park last summer." e cannot remain silent while a U.S. senator from Montana chooses willful ignorance of the greatest threat this state has ever faced and which is already causing extreme damage to our cherished Montana environment," said the church leaders ― the Reverends Amy Carter and Laura Folkwein of the United Church of Christ in Missoula; the Reverend Susan Barnes of the St. Andrew Presbyterian Church in Billings; and Father Robert Grosch of the nearby St. Patrick Co-Cathedral." he simple moral truth is that United States is by far the world's largest historic contributor to the climate crisis and therefore bears the greatest responsibility for addressing it," they added. The church leaders slammed Daines for having the "audacity" to challenge the overwhelming scientific consensus that emissions from farms and burning fossil fuels are trapping heat in the atmosphere and causing the planet to warm. Not unlike the years of public skepticism over smoking's role in lung cancer, many people still doubt the science behind global warming thanks to a decades-long campaign to seed doubt funded by companies with money at stake. Daines, who earned a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering before entering politics, received a paltry 3 percent lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters, which ranks lawmakers by how they vote on environmental legislation. He did, however, earn a 16 percent score for last year. In 2012, he told Montana Public Radio he believes the climate is changing, but doubts how much humans are effecting it. We view science as a way to deepen our appreciation and wonder at the majesty of God's creation, including the complex, beautiful and life-sustaining planet earth.	False	True	True	True	False
46	foxnews	right_bias	2019-03-18	Bill de Blasio, pitching $10B climate change plan, blames global warming for Hurricane Sandy In a video posted to social media on Monday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio again directly blamed climate change for 2012's deady Superstorm Sandy -- a contention that lacks scientific support - and touted his plan to spend $10 billion to fortify and "protect Lower Manhattan" against future storms. Even as local leaders warned that de Blasio's plan to construct new barriers would actually destroy the waterfront neighborhoods he says he wants to protect, de Blasio insisted his views were now mainstream among New Yorkers." After Sandy, there weren't a lot of climate change deniers left in New York City," de Blasio said directly into the camera, after reminding viewers that the storm left dozens dead and cost the city billions in economic losses. "We need to protect this city and this country, and this world, from global warming. There's no national policy to do it right now. ... We have to do it ourselves." Mayor de Blasio added in the video, which appeared on Facebook and Twitter, that the federal government also must act quickly: "We have to fight for the bigger changes, like the Green New Deal," de Blasio said. The mayor claimed that studies undertaken by his office and others has determined that if the city does not prepare for climate change, rising seas will expose 20 percent of lower Manhattan to daily flooding by 2100. However, past expert predictions on the effects of global warming have proven inaccurate at best. For example, United Nations scientists predicted that the world had only 10 years to immediately address climate change all the way back in 1989, in order to protect entire cities from destruction and a resulting flood of eco-refugees. A NASA scientist falsely predicted the same thing in 2006. Contrary to de Blasio's assertions, no study has defintively linked the existence or power of Superstorm Sandy to man-made climate change, or made the claim that such a link can be definitively established at all. Some contested studies have, however, suggested the storm may have become more intense to some degree as a result of warming sea temperatures." We suggest that it is more useful to regard the extreme circulation regime or weather event as being largely unaffected by climate change, and question whether known changes in the climate system's thermodynamic state affected the impact of the particular event," stated one paper produced by researchers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The researchers added: "Some examples briefly illustrated include 'snowmaggedon' in February 2010, Superstorm Sandy in October 2012 and supertyphoon Haiyan in November 2013, and, in more detail, the Boulder floods of September 2013, all of which were influenced by high sea surface temperatures that had a discernible human component." The Green New Deal backed by de Blasio has not attracted universal support even among Democrats, after the resolution's botched rollout in Congress earlier this year included the release of an official document by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's office that promised economic security even for those "unwilling to work," as well as the elimination of "farting cows" and air travel. The Democratic mayor on Thursday first announced his plan to meet the "existential threat" of climate change, specifically by extending a section of the lower Manhattan coastline as much as 500 feet into the East River. He said the $10 billion effort to protect lower Manhattan from flooding by extending the shoreline between the Brooklyn Bridge and the Battery will be funded partly by private development if federal funds are not available. WHAT DOES TRUMP ADMIN'S OWN CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT SAY IS COMING?"If there's federal money in play, it probably looks one way," de Blasio said last week. "If there's not federal money in play, we have to get some private money into it and there has to be some development." Officials have been developing schemes to fortify New York City's waterfront since Superstorm Sandy destroyed thousands of homes and businesses in 2012. De Blasio said it will cost about $500 million to fortify most of lower Manhattan from future effects of climate change, including rising sea levels and intense precipitation, with grassy berms and removable barriers. But planners determined that protecting the lowest-lying area, including South Street Seaport and the financial district, will require adding more land over several years. De Blasio, who is contemplating joining the crowded field of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates, said the $10 billion landfill project should be supported by federal funds, but that's unlikely to happen during the administration of Republican President Donald Trump." Lower Manhattan is one of the core centers of the American economy," he said. "It's where the financial capital of the United States is. The security of lower Manhattan should be a national priority. The fact is it is not. And it's incomprehensible to me that there's no sense of urgency from the federal government." He added, "We can't afford to bury our head in the sand and that's right now what our federal government is doing." The plan to extend the coastline will go through the city's environmental review process, de Blasio said, but he hopes to avoid "the endless dragging on that usually accompanies something of this scale." CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPBut the prospect of private development on the newly built land is sure to meet resistance from downtown Manhattan community members. City Council member Margaret Chin, who represents the area, said a more resilient future "cannot be paid for by private real estate development that would destroy the waterfront neighborhoods that we are trying to protect." De Blasio announced the climate resilience plan at a news conference after previewing it in New York magazine ." This is the existential threat," de Blasio said. "This is the core issue we all must face as aggressively as humanly possible." The Associated Press contributed to this report.	False	False	True	False	True
611	TheBlaze	right_bias	2017-06-03	Watch: It takes Tucker Carlson just 90 seconds to completely destroy liberal hypocrisy on climate change When it comes to unraveling liberal hypocrisy, Fox News host Tucker Carlson is arguably the best man for the job. And on his show Friday, it took Carlson just 90 seconds to completely dismantle liberal outrage over President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change. Progressives across the country and around the world expressed outrage this week over Trump's decision to withdraw from the agreement. But many of those expressing outrage, including world famous Hollywood actors and businessmen, typically fly around the world in private jets that expel mind-boggling amounts of carbon dioxide — the exact substance climate alarmists say is the cause of climate change. Carlson explained on his show Friday that despite the fact that those upset about Trump's decision have not "bothered to explain what's actually in" the Paris agreement, "they assure us that that deal is the solution to the single most gravest threat this planet has ever faced: rising levels of atmospheric CO2." They're dead serious about that. You can tell by the outraged looks on their faces and the purple rhetoric," Carlson said. "But hold on for a minute. Can we really be sure that these people take carbon emissions seriously?"To answer that question, Carlson said his team compared what the progressives say to how they live. They examined the lives of billionaire businessmen Richard Branson, Elon Musk and Bill Gates, in addition to Hollywood superstar Leonardo DiCaprio and Hillary Clinton." ranson says fossil fuels are 'dangerous' and he calls Trump's decision 'America first, Earth last.' Now on the other hand, Branson owes a Desault Falcon 50EX private jet and it burns more fuel on a single flight to Maui than you're gonna go through in a lifetime of trips to the shore," Carlson explained." lon Musk, meanwhile, is mad about global warming too. Yet he flies around in a Gulfstream G6500ER. Bill Gates says he's 'deeply concerned' yet he still commutes in a $62 million bombardier BD700 global express. Can you imagine the gas milage that gets?" Carlson continued." eonardo DiCaprio says Trump's move threatens the 'livability of our planet' and yet DiCaprio flew a private jet 4,000 miles from Cannes, France, to New York to accept a climate award — and then flew back privately," Carlson went on to explain." illary Clinton tweeted that Trump's pullout was a 'historic mistake that leaves American workers and families behind.' And yet, speaking of workers and their families, there probably weren't a lot of those onboard last year when Hillary used a private jet to fly 20 miles from Martha's Vineyard to Nantucket for a fundraiser," Carlson added. Trump announced his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the climate deal, which was agreed to under former President Barack Obama, on Thursday.	False	True	True	True	False

Now ― with the White House poised to gut the federal government's only two major rules to reduce planet-warming emissions, and Trump threatening to cut aid to drought- and violence-afflicted Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador ― critics say the administration's strategy to deal with climate change is taking shape, frustrating national security experts who say hunkering down and militarizing borders will do little to mitigate global warming's threats."  quasi-fascist policy of fear-mongering about immigration and corresponding militarization of the border is clearly the major thrust of Trump's response to the mounting impacts of climate chaos," said Ashley Dawson, author of Extreme Cities: The Peril and Promise of Urban Life in the Age of Climate Change. Despite the repeated dismissals of climate science by the president and many of his top advisers, the Trump administration officially forecasts that the planet is expected to warm by 7 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century ― a projection buried in a 500-page environmental impact statement in August. That's roughly double the temperature scientists say will cause cataclysmic drought, storms and sea level rise, and roughly four times the warming the planet has already experienced since the pre-industrial era. Under those conditions, more than 1 billion people globally could be forced to flee their homes by 2050, and 2 billion by 2100. Tropical regions ― where many of the roughly 20,000 to 40,000 migrants who crossed the U.S. southern border each month in the past year came from ― are expected to be hit the hardest. It's difficult to draw a direct line between climate change and a migrant's decision to leave home, and neither the United Nations nor nearly any other major countries currently offer legal avenues for asylum seekers fleeing the effects of global warming. New Zealand became the first country late last year to create a special status for climate refugees with 100 annual visas as low-lying island nations in its corner of the Pacific face existential threat of sea-level rise. On the opposite side of the ocean, a hotter climate is expected to parch once fertile lands. In an email, Jennifer Francis, a Rutgers University climate researcher, said "it's likely that increasing drought in Central America is making it more difficult for farmers there to make a living." The President had willing partners in Congress and could have worked on immigration, border security, DREAMers and all that," Joseph Majkut, director of climate policy at the Niskanen Center, a libertarian think tank, said in an email. "But he didn't take advantage of that opportunity. Having missed the chance to seek actual reforms, we now get a militaristic and hasty response to a predictable stress." Climate change [is] contributing to make nations unstable, both nations in our neighborhood and others abroad," said Femia, whose Washington-based policy institute includes former top national security advisers. "The best way, from a security perspective, is to bolster the resilience of those countries so you reduce the likelihood of instability, reduce the likelihood of conflict and reduce the likelihood of displacement that might force outward migration." That doesn't seem likely in the near term. The president attempted to cut funding for United States Agency for International Development by 33 percent this year, though bipartisan support for the federal government's dedicated aid agency staved off the proposal. By deporting hundreds of thousands of Central Americans from the United States, the administration, like the Obama administration before it, is bolstering gang recruitment in countries like El Salvador, according to a December report from the International Crisis Group. That worsens the violence that many cite as a main reason for fleeing northward.	False	False	False	False	False

Climate change is already affecting millions of people," another young woman claimed. "This could lead to mass extinction." We are not here to guilt individuals that forgot to recycle a cup last week," another young woman said. "We are here to hold cowardice [sic] politicians accountable who have caused this damage by turning their heads in fear." Those 12 years left (to stop carbon emissions)," a young woman yelled. "Is now down to 10 years and five months." One young woman said she wanted to acknowledge Hurricane Dorian, a storm that is still in the Atlantic Ocean and is not expected to make landfall somewhere in Florida until early next week." t is ravaging the coast of Florida," the girl said. "It is not a coincidence. It is a direct impact of the climate crisis." The youths held signs that read "Greed Kills," "Help My Home is on Fire," and "527 Years of Indigenous Resistance" and chanted in between speeches phrases such as:"What do we want?" "Climate Justice." "When do we want it? Now." No more coal, no more oil, keep your carbon in the soil," and "Waters are rising, people are dying."A speaker said that the protest was not the goal of the movement by a "catalyst" for action, including a planned "global climate strike" on September 20, just three days ahead of a U.N. climate summit that is expected to draw leaders from around the world and where Thunberg will be a special guest and speaker. The speaker listed the group's demands, which will be presented at the U.N. summit: "A just and livable world" where "fossil fuels are left out of every decision" around the world; 100 percent renewable energy around the globe; and "holding polluters accountable" for causing the "climate crisis." The publicist for the New York City protest refused to speak with Breitbart News when an inquiry was made about Thunberg's appearance and about Alexandria Villaseñor, a 14-year-old who claims she has been protesting every Friday at the United Nations for 38 weeks. Reporters on the scene were kept from interviewing Thunberg during the protest. Thunberg gained international attention when she cut school a year ago to appear before the Swedish parliament where she called on young people around the world to cut school every Friday to protest climate change. It is not clear how many students in New York are still on summer break or skipped classes, but Thunberg's publicity team announced that the 16-year-old is taking a "sabbatical" from her high school studies to "concentrate on her activism." After attending the U.N. summit, Thunberg and her father will travel in the United States, Canada, and Mexico before attending a second U.N. climate change summit in Chile in December. Thunberg has said she is not sure how she will get back to Sweden, and no details have been released on how she will travel around the North and South American continents without the help of fossil-fuel-powered transportation.

595	Drudge Report	right_bias	2017-09-26	California Considers Following China With Combustion-Engine Car Ban... The internal combustion engine's days may be numbered in California, where officials are mulling whether a ban on sales of polluting autos is needed to achieve long-term targets for cleaner air. Governor Jerry Brown has expressed an interest in barring the sale of vehicles powered by internal-combustion engines, Mary Nichols, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, said in an interview Friday at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. The earliest such a ban is at least a decade away, she said. Brown, one of the most outspoken elected official in the U.S. about the need for policies to combat climate change, would be replicating similar moves by China, France and the U.K." 've gotten messages from the governor asking, 'Why haven't we done something already?'" Nichols said, referring to China's planned phase-out of fossil-fuel vehicle sales. "The governor has certainly indicated an interest in why China can do this and not California." Embracing such a policy would send shockwaves through the global car industry due to the heft of California's auto market. More than 2 million new passenger vehicles were registered in the state last year, topping France, Italy or Spain. If a ban were implemented, automakers from General Motors Co. to Toyota Motor Corp. would be under new pressure to make electric vehicles the standard for personal transportation in the most populous U.S. state, casting fresh doubts on the future of gasoline- and diesel-powered autos elsewhere. The Association of Global Automakers said consumers must be able to afford the cleaner cars that California says are needed to meet its climate goals. The trade association represents Toyota, Honda Motor Co. and other overseas carmakers in the U.S." We have been working with California on intelligent, market-based approaches to emissions reductions beyond 2025, and we hope that this doesn't signal an abandonment of that position," Global Automakers Chief Executive Officer John Bozzella said in a statement. California has set a goal to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050. Rising emissions from on-road transportation has undercut the state's efforts to reduce pollution, according to Next 10, San Francisco-based non-profit." o reach the ambitious levels of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, we have to pretty much replace all combustion with some form of renewable energy by 2040 or 2050," Nichols said. "We're looking at that as a method of moving this discussion forward." California has the authority to write its own pollution rules, which dates back to the 1970 Clean Air Act. Those rules are underpinned by waivers granted by the Environmental Protection Agency. Nichols said the state would likely take a different legal route to enable a possible ban rather than use an EPA waiver, since the Trump administration would be unlikely to approve one. For example, California could use vehicle registration rules or control the vehicles that can access state highways, she said." e certainly wouldn't expect to get a waiver for that from EPA," Nichols said. "I think we would be looking at using some of our other authorities to get to that result." Read more: California Sets Demands for Auto-Emission Talks With TrumpChina will likely order an end to sales of all polluting vehicles by 2030, the chairman of electric-carmaker BYD Co. said Thursday. France and the U.K. have announced 2040 as their end date for sales of fossil fuel-powered cars.A ban for California could also still be decades away from implementation, and just how far out remains to be seen, Nichols said." here are people who believe, including who work for me, that you could stop all sales of new internal-combustion cars by 2030. Some people say 2035, some people say 2040," she said. "It's awfully hard to predict any of that with precision, but it doesn't appear to be out of the question."	True	False	False	False	False
558	rt	questionable_source	2018-10-12	Media storm targets Gov. Rick Scott's climate change denial after Hurricane Michael pummels Florida As Hurricane Michael pummeled the Gulf coast, a less deadly but equally ferocious media storm formed around Florida Governor Rick Scott, whose alleged climate change denial has been blamed for putting Floridians in harm's way. Viral videos, New York Times op-eds, and Guardian contributors all highlighted Rick Scott's "backward stance" on climate change after Michael, a powerful typhoon, made landfall along the Florida Panhandle. According to these media reports and commentaries, Scott's "science denial" has endangered Florida residents. In other words, if Scott were more vocal about man-made climate change, Florida would have been better prepared for – or perhaps could have even prevented – the devastating hurricane." Florida is the state most endangered by climate change," declares a video published by Now This. "But Gov. Scott's strategy for dealing with it is denial." The New York Times' Nicholas Kristof also took Scott to task for his stance on climate change, writing that "alas, denying climate change doesn't actually prevent it." He added: "Some folks will say this isn't the moment for politics. But don't we have a responsibility to mitigate the next disaster?"It's true that Scott, who is currently running for the Senate, has shown little interest in highlighting or combating the alleged dangers of climate change. In 2015, after the governor took office, the Florida Department of Environment was reportedly banned from using the terms "climate change" and "global warming." Two years later, Scott signed a bill that critics dubbed the "anti-science law," which allows residents to file complaints about instructional materials used in public schools. Scott has a section on his website dedicated to environmental issues – but it is curiously absent of any direct mentions of climate change. However, his website does note that Scott "fought to protect Florida's coastline by getting Florida removed from consideration for offshore oil drilling and securing millions of dollars in state funding to help local governments with coastal resilience projects and sea level rise planning." On the campaign trail, Scott has dodged questions about climate change, resorting to responses such as "I'm not a scientist" to avoid weighing in on the subject. The motive behind Scott's alleged "science denial" has also received media attention. Last year, the Tampa Bay Times alleged that Scott's personal business ties to the energy industry may be the reason for the state's legislative inaction on climate change. The paper claimed that Scott had hefty investments in petroleum companies that oppose restrictions on greenhouse gases and other environmental regulations. READ MORE: Hurricane Michael shuts in 40% off Gulf of Mexico oil productionThe Florida governor hasn't been the only one singled out by the media for his "backward" views, however. According to The Guardian, anyone who isn't a fervent believer in man-made climate change is to blame for Hurricane Michael – even the hurricane's victims." Victims of Hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers,"reads the headline an op-ed published in The Guardian on Thursday. "Elections have consequences. Denying science has consequences. And we are reaping what we sow," the subhead states matter-of-factly. The headline was later amended to "Victims of Hurricane Michael are represented by climate deniers." Climate deniers are making these storms worse by stopping action on climate change. What the hell do we expect to happen when the deniers are writing the laws?" the commentary, penned by John Abraham, a professor of thermal sciences, asks rhetorically. Social media users appeared to largely line up behind the allegations hurled at Scott – although some seemed unconvinced that the governor was at fault." Rick Scott can ban the term all he wants in FLORIDA. Climate change is real," one Twitter user wrote." He's bought and paid for," claimed another. Others were less accusatory." It's not our words that are negatively affecting the atmosphere. It's the damage we are doing to the planet," one Twitter user noted in response to the Now This video." Lol. Like the weather would give a crap if he went mute," a netizen observed. At least six people have been killed as a result of Hurricane Michael, the third most powerful storm ever to hit the US mainland, according to officials. The hurricane made landfall as a Category-4 storm, but later weakened to a Category 1 on Wednesday night. As Hurricane Michael gradually loses strength, however, it appears that the media storm over the consequences of climate change denial is only growing.

Thirteen cities and one county in California have put in place zoning codes encouraging or requiring all-electric new construction, virtually banning builders from running natural gas lines into homes and apartments to fuel appliances, including stoves and ovens. USA Today reported that people believe the move is necessary to fight climate change "with an eye toward creating fewer legacy gas hookups as the nation shifts to carbon-neutral energy sources." For natural gas companies, it's a threat to their existence. And for some cooks who love to prepare food with flame, it's an unthinkable loss. Natural gas is a fossil fuel, mostly methane, and produces 33% of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas causing climate change." here's no pathway to stabilizing the climate without phasing gas out of our homes and buildings," Rachel Golden of the Sierra Club's building electrification campaign, said. "This is a must-do for the climate and a livable planet." But the page linked to on the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) website is referring, ironically, to CO2 emissions from the U.S. electric power sector by source for 2018. The new codes call for replacing gas with electricity. The federal website reports on the benefits of using natural gas as an energy source:Burning natural gas for energy results in fewer emissions of nearly all types of air pollutants and carbon dioxide (CO2) than burning coal or petroleum products to produce an equal amount of energy. About 117 pounds of carbon dioxide are produced per million British thermal units (MMBtu) equivalent of natural gas compared with more than 200 pounds of CO2 per MMBtu of coal and more than 160 pounds per MMBtu of distillate fuel oil. The clean burning properties of natural gas have contributed to increased natural gas use for electricity generation and as a transportation fuel for fleet vehicles in the United States." robably the biggest stumbling block for most pondering an all-electric home is the prospect of not having a gas stove," USA Today reported." t's the only thing that people ever ask about," Bruce Nilles, who directs the building electrification program of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a Colorado-based think tank that focuses on energy and resource efficiency, said in the USA Today report. According to a 2017 kitchen study by the NPD Group, 35 percent of U.S. households have a gas stove, while 55 percent have electric." ut the number of natural gas customers is also rising," USA Today reported. "The American Gas Association, which represents more than 200 local energy companies, says an average of one new customer is added every minute." That's exactly the wrong direction," Nilles said." he idea that denying access to natural gas in new homes is necessary to meet emissions reduction goals is false," American Gas Association President and CEO Karen Harbert. "In fact, denying access to natural gas could make meeting emissions goals harder and more expensive." They also say it's more expensive to run an all-electric home," USA Today reported. "A study by AGA released last year suggested that all-electric homes would pay $750 to $910 a year more for energy-related costs, as well as amortized appliance and upgrade costs." USA Today also pointed out that California is not the only place where people want more government regulation. New York, Hawaii, Colorado, and Maine have carbon-neutrality goals, and as many as 140 U.S. cities have similar plans.	False	False	True	False	True
704	The Huffington Post	left_bias	2017-10-31	Scott Pruitt Just Cleared The Way For Industry Control Of EPA's Science Advisory Boards At a Tuesday afternoon event rolling out the new policy, Administrator Scott Pruitt invoked a biblical tale from the book of Joshua, in which the pagans are instructed to "choose this day whom you will serve," either God or the "gods of your fathers." As it relates to grants from this agency, you're going to have to choose," said Pruitt, who described the new rule as a way of ensuring "there's integrity in the process and that the scientists that are advising us are doing so without any kind of appearance of conflict." Pruitt described scientists who received as much as $77 million in grants from the agency while also serving on advisory boards as damaging the perception of independent rule-making. Pruitt signed an order cementing the new rules into policy during the 28-minute event, with Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) and Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas), two of the most ardent climate change deniers in Congress, at his side." dministrator Pruitt is purging expert scientists from his science boards ― and replacing them with mouthpieces for big polluters," Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) said in a statement. "Now, instead of independent science guiding the way, hired guns for industry will be steering EPA policy on central issues affecting clean air, clean water, and public health." Pruitt said nothing of industry-funded science, which has long been used to kneecap regulations. For many scientists working in a time of limited research budgets, funding from the EPA or other government agencies is one of the few sources available, other than industry money." holly unaddressed by the directive is any counterpart prohibition on scientists funded by industries with conflicts of interest from serving as EPA advisors," Richard Denison, a lead senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, wrote in a blog post. "When it comes to advice the agency receives, the core concern over the need to avoid conflicts of interest is this: Is advice tainted because the entity employing and paying the advisor stands to gain or lose financially from the agency decision that is under advisement?"The advisory boards, which Congress created as a check on EPA policies and regulations, include the EPA Science Advisory Board, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) and the Board of Scientific Counselors. Pruitt said he plans to announce new members of the boards next week, after scientists began quitting the councils in protest earlier this year. While Pruitt's new order rejects anyone who receives funding from the agency, he has named industry allies to those same boards. As part of the announcement, he tapped Michael Honeycutt, the head of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's toxicology division, to serve as the head of the Science Advisory Board. Honeycutt once suggested the health risks linked to smog were overstated, described ozone standards as "alarmism" that made "no biological sense" because "most people are indoors for 90 percent of the time," and blasted the EPA for relying on epidemiological studies that he considered "not scientifically rigorous." In 2010, the Texas Observer called him a "crony" of then-Gov. Rick Perry (R) and accused him of "abusing science." Honeycutt relied heavily on research produced by Michael Dourson, whose consultancy, Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment, was described in 2014 by InsideClimate News as the "one-stop science shop" favored by the chemical and tobacco industries. (Pruitt picked Dourson to lead the agency's chemical safety division last month.)Pruitt also tapped Tony Cox, who runs the private consultancy Cox Associates and produces research for major industry groups, to lead the CASAC. He has done research on lung disease issues for the American Chemistry Council, a trade group for the chemical industry, and research on health effects associated with fine particulate matter and ozone for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry's main lobbying group, according to The Intercept. In 2015, he railed against the EPA's plans to tighten rules on ozone emissions. Pruitt appointed Paul Gilman as the head of the Board of Scientific Counselors. Gilman currently serves as the chief sustainability officer at the waste management and incinerator company Covanta. He has been a leading advocate for incinerating trash as a source of fuel for electricity. The trash incinerator industry provides only a tiny fraction of U.S. power, but wields outsize influence in some cities and has attempted to sabotage the U.S. Conference of Mayors' effort to push for 100 percent renewable energy." cott Pruitt doesn't want to listen to a word from anyone who isn't in the pocket of corporate polluters," Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said in a statement. "For Pruitt, anything that helps corporate polluters make money is good and science and facts are just roadblocks he wants to tear down."	False	False	True	True	False
537	npr	left_center_bias	2018-10-08	Climate Report Warns Of Extreme Weather, Displacement Of Millions Without Action Climate Report Warns Of Extreme Weather, Displacement Of Millions Without ActionSome of the world's top climate scientists have concluded that global warming is likely to reach dangerous levels unless new technologies are developed to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says pledges from the world's governments to reduce greenhouse gases, made in Paris in 2015, aren't enough to keep global warming from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees F) above pre-industrial temperatures. That was the Paris agreement's most ambitious target (a 2-degree C rise was established as a more practical goal). But even with a 1.5-degree C increase, the world can expect serious changes to weather, sea levels, agriculture and natural eco-systems, according to a report issued Monday following an IPCC meeting in South Korea." Limiting warming to 1.5 C is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics," says Jim Skea of Imperial College London, one of the authors of the report, "but doing so would require unprecedented changes." Scientists and climate researchers have long doubted that the 1.5-degree C goal was practical or economically feasible. Their new report lays out the difficulty in stark detail: it would require a 40-50 percent reduction in emissions by 2030 (global emissions are currently rising). It would mean a carbon-neutral world — one with no net additional greenhouse gases in the atmosphere — by 2050. They now say that scenario is very unlikely without new measures and technologies to remove greenhouse gases from the air, some of which have yet to be invented." We have a monumental task in front of us," says co-author Natalie Mahowald, from Cornell University, "but it is not impossible." In 50 years, she says, "it's going to be very different. This is our chance to decide what that road will look like." The IPCC report holds out hope that if the global climate warms more than the 1.5-degree, or even the 2-degree target, this "overshoot" could be reversed with carbon removal techniques. It suggests numerous ways to take carbon dioxide (CO2), the leading greenhouse gas, out of the atmosphere. Growing more forests, which absorb CO2, is one tactic. But research shows that the amount of land needed for that would be formidable. Another possibility involves burning biomass to make electricity instead of using fossil fuels. Currently, about 1 percent of electricity in the U.S. is made that way, using things like waste wood and agricultural material. It's expensive, however. Crops like corn are now turned into ethanol, but that raises food prices. To be economical, the biomass would have to be agricultural waste or special crops like switchgrass that don't compete with food crops. There are experimental methods now that can take CO2 directly out of the air, after which it could be buried. But billions of tons of CO2 would have to come out, and these techniques now cost as much as $1,000 to extract a single ton of CO2, according to Howard Herzog, an engineer at MIT who specializes in these "carbon capture" technologies. CO2 is a tiny percentage of the air; Herzog likens the technique to removing 400 "CO2 marbles" from a pile of one million marbles." The best way to remove CO2 from the air," he says in his book Carbon Capture, is "to not release it into the air in the first place." Herzog calls most of these extraction ideas "more of a hope than a reality." He says it comes down to cost, and "it's a lot cheaper to take it out now (by reducing emissions) than in the future." But most governments now fear the cost of a global overhaul of the world's energy economy in the short time needed to meet the Paris climate goals. As the report concludes: "There is no simple answer to the questions of whether it is feasible to limit warming to 1.5 C and to adapt to the consequences...." However, it does make clear the consequences of warming above that level: more heat waves, more severe rain and snow events, higher sea levels, damage to agriculture and displacement of millions of people.

681	Vox	left_bias	2017-06-01	Climate change will make people sicker. Trump is pulling out of Paris anyway. President Donald Trump is making good on his campaign promise to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement — a move that's been called a moral disgrace and that's expected to hinder much needed progress in the fight against global warming.A failure to tackle climate change will mean more extreme weather, dirtier air and water, and more food shortages. It'll also mean more disease. Researchers have long been arguing that the effects of climate change could undermine the last 50 years of gains in global health, increasing the spread of infections like yellow fever and chronic diseases like asthma and heart disease. Now is not the time to be scaling back efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The December 2015 agreement, which has been signed by nearly 200 countries, aimed to cut greenhouse gas emissions and keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. (The US had committed to cutting its emissions by up to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025.) These goals were widely viewed as a win for public health. America's retreat now could be a major setback. There are a number of ways climate change puts us at a greater risk for disease. Chief among them: a warmer planet is one that's more hospitable to disease. Disease-carrying vectors like mosquitoes thrive in warm and moist environments. Zika, dengue, and chikungunya are all spread by the Aedes type mosquito. And one of the reasons researchers think Aedes may be reaching new places — and more people — lately is climate change. It's not just mosquitoes, though: Bird flu, cholera, Lyme disease, salmonella — researchers believe all are being made worse by climate change. At a February meeting on climate change and health, former Vice President Al Gore focused his talk on this problem. "Climate change is tilting the balance, disrupting natural ecosystems and giving more of an advantage to microbes," he said. "Changing climate conditions change the areas in which these diseases can take root and become endemic." (Read Maryn McKenna's New York Times story for more on this.)In addition, deforestation and urbanization are moving humans into areas where they haven't lived before, and putting them into closer contact with animals that carry disease-causing microbes — like bats during West Africa's 2014 Ebola outbreak. Brian Deese, a senior adviser to President Barack Obama overseeing climate change and energy policy, and former Ebola czar Ron Klain explained why in a piece at the Washington Post:Climate change destroys habitats and stresses animal populations such as the bats of West Africa, forcing them to hunt for food nearer to humans. Humans, likewise pressed by climate impacts, encroach more closely on animal habitats. While we cannot know that climate change was the cause of the specific interaction between bats and humans that is believed to have launched the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, we will see more of these interactions in the future, and more epidemics as a result. Ebola demonstrates that even localized dislocation of people and animals can create global risk. Climate change is a threat multiplier for much broader dislocation — accelerating the complex factors that drive people from their homes. Greenhouse gases are not only harmful to the environment — they also increase the risk of everything from asthma to heart disease. According to the Global Burden of Disease project, more than 5 million people die worldwide each year because of air pollution, and emissions from coal-fired plants are a major risk factor here. It's one reason why health experts have been pushing policymakers to rapidly phase out of coal. For miners, the immediate health risks include black lung disease and scarring of the lung tissue. But the pollutants emitted when coal is processed — including sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and mercury — have much more far-reaching effects on many more people. In one large study involving 450,000 Americans followed between 1982 and 2004, researchers found that increased exposure to the particles in fossil fuel emissions increased the risk of death from heart disease — and particles from coal burning were five times more damaging than other similar particles. Reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants makes it easier to breathe. Over the past 30 years, the percentage of Americans with asthma has more than doubled, and climate change has been a significant driver of that trend. Air pollution triggers asthma attacks, contributing to lung abnormalities, particularly in the developing pulmonary systems of children. The Paris agreement was no panacea — but it nudged the world in the right direction. Now, the US moves backward. It's not just the future of the environment that's at stake here. Our health hangs in the balance, too.	True	False	True	False	False
522	bbc	left_center_bias	2018-03-23	Half of African species 'face extinction' The actions of mankind could lead to the extinction of half of African birds and mammals by the end of 2100, a UN-backed study has said. The report conducted by 550 experts from around the world said reduced biodiversity could affect people's quality of life. It also found 42% of land-based animal and plant species in Europe and Central Asia have declined in the last decade. The findings come after the death of the last male northern white rhino. Despite the bleak findings, the study also pointed to some successes in reversing declines in wildlife. The study by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) showed forest cover in China and other parts of north-east Asia had risen by more than 20% between 1990 and 2015. It also found that animals, such as the amur leopard, which were once on the verge of the extinction had grown in population. Speaking at the 2018 Biodiversity Summit in Colombia, leading British scientist Sir Robert Watson said: "We must act to halt and reverse the unsustainable use of nature or risk the future we want and have." Fortunately, the evidence also shows that we know how to protect and partially restore our vital natural assets." Academic volunteers looked through some 10,000 scientific publications for what is said to be the most extensive biodiversity survey since 2005. Among the list of the biggest threats to food and water security were pollution, climate change, and deforestation. Scientists say governments, businesses, and individuals must consider the impact on biodiversity when taking decisions on farming, fishing, forestry, mining, or infrastructure development.

In a New York Times op-ed video published Tuesday, Nick Mullins, a ninth-generation Appalachian from Virginia, said that if Trump wants to help the Appalachian mining communities that support him, "lowering emission standards is not the way to do it." At this year's State of the Union address, Trump talked about ending "the war on beautiful, clean coal." Mullins says "coal cannot be clean," and that miners know firsthand." We have to realize that the environmental impacts of the industry aren't a partisan issue," he said. "They're a matter of life or death." On Tuesday, the newly proposed Affordable Clean Energy Rule was announced , which would allow states to set their own emission standards for coal-fueled power plants. Throughout his campaign and presidency, Trump has lauded his plan to replace the Obama administration's climate change policies with rules and regulations that would be more friendly toward the coal industry. The Obama administration's Clean Power Plan made greenhouse gas emissions federally regulated for the first time.	True	True	True	False	False
279	dailymail	questionable_source	2019-09-24	Greta Thunberg doesn't know how she will return to Sweden Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has already caused a sensation on her trip to North America, tearing into world leaders yesterday in an emotional speech at the United Nations and giving a death stare to Donald Trump. What is not yet clear is how the 16-year-old will get back to Sweden, because she refuses to travel on fuel-guzzling planes and the 60ft racing boat she travelled on is already back in Europe. Two crew members have flown to the U.S. to sail the Malizia II back across the Atlantic and it is not yet clear exactly when Thunberg will be going home. When she set off from Britain last month she admitted: 'I don't know yet how I will get home'. Non-stop flights from London to New York City take between eight to ten hours for a 3,470-mile journey. It equates to about 183,910 pounds of emissions per flight between the two cities and Thunberg refuses to add to the environmental cost. She has also persuaded her parents to stop flying, hampering her mother's career as an international opera singer.'My generation won't be able to fly other than for emergencies, in a foreseeable future if we are to be the least bit serious' about limiting global warming, she has previously said. Thunberg also refuses to travel aboard a cruise ship, as they are also notoriously big polluters. The Malizia II is now back in France after sailing back from New York without Thunberg. Unless the Malizia II returns to North America she will have to find a different mode of transport back across the Atlantic when she eventually leaves. In the meantime, she plans to promote her climate agenda across North America. This week she will travel from New York to Montreal to join a school climate strike in Canada on what is expected to be a day of global protests. She also hopes to visit Mexico, and is due in Chile for a climate summit in December, travelling across the Americas by bus and train. The 16-year-old is taking a year out of school to lobby for climate action after starting the school strike movement in Sweden last August. She skipped school for the first three weeks after term began and then took Fridays off to spend the day outside Sweden's parliament with a sign labelled 'School strike for climate'. Her protests have inspired wealthy donors to contribute to a Climate Emergency Fund to support the protests and the simultaneous Extinction Rebellion movement. Its donors include heiress Aileen Getty, American philanthropist Trevor Neilson, and filmmaker Rory Kennedy, a member of the political Kennedy clan. The Swedish teenager named this week's UN Climate Action Summit and the Chile conference in December as her main reasons for crossing the Atlantic. She said last year she had been invited to speak around the world but refused to make the necessary flights. But in June she said 'it looks like a large part of our future will probably be decided in New York and Santiago' and agreed to travel to North America on the yacht. Pierre Casiraghi, the grandson of Monaco's late Prince Rainier III and American actress Grace Kelly, and fellow yachtsman Boris Herrmann offered her passage on the Malizia II. She arrived last month after a two-week journey aboard the racing yacht. Thunberg documented parts of her journey on Twitter, where she included videos of choppy weather conditions, photos of herself and the crew, and commentaries about climate change. Last week she joined a school strike in New York City where school officials allowed pupils the day off to attend the protest. In her impassioned address yesterday she said: 'This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean.'Yet you have come to us young people for hope. How dare you? 'You have stolen my dreams, my childhood with your empty words.'Yet I'm one of the lucky ones. People are suffering, people are dying, entire ecosystems are collapsing, and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?''The eyes of future generations are on you and if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this.'Trump sent a mocking tweet, saying: 'She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!'Fewer than half the 136 heads of government or state in New York this week to attend the UN General Assembly attended on Monday. Ahead of the conference, the United Nations issued a release saying 66 countries vowed to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, along with 10 regions, 102 cities, and scores of businesses.

383	thedailycaller	right_bias	2018-11-05	These Six States Have Energy And Global Warming On The Ballot This Election There is a wave of energy-related ballot initiatives for voters to weigh in on this election year. Voters from Washington to Florida will be able to partake in important energy policy decisions for their states. Will Washington become the first state to tax carbon dioxide emissions? Will California undo a gas tax increase passed just seven months ago?The Daily Caller News Foundation lays out everything one needs to know about the six most important energy battles this election. (RELATED: Severe Storms Brewing For Election Day, Threaten To Swing Tight Races)Washington voters will decide whether or not to tax carbon dioxide emissions, a policy championed by Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee and many Democrats and environmentalists who want to fight man-made global warming. The ballot measure, called Initiative 1631, would tax carbon dioxide emissions from industrial sources at $15 per ton in 2020, which would increase every year to reduce emissions. Supporters say the measure could raise more than $1 billion in revenue. Opponents, however, point out a carbon tax would raise the price of virtually every good while having no impact on future global warming. The tax would cost households and extra $175 per year in 2020, according to some estimates. The battle of Initiative 1631 has become the most expensive in state history, so far drawing $45 million from both sides of the policy. Carbon tax opponents, led by the oil and gas industry, pumped $30 million into opposing the ballot measure, and proponents have spent $15 million. An October poll found 50 percent of Washington voters favored the carbon tax, while 36 percent opposed it. Colorado voters could end up banning hydraulic fracturing in most of the state. Polls show strong support for Proposition 112. The ballot measure, if enacted, would prohibit oil and gas drilling within 2,500 feet of any building or "vulnerable" area, including waterways and playgrounds. That's more than double the current state buffer for oil and gas operations.A September poll put support for Proposition 112 at 60 percent, but many prominent Democrats have come out against the measure. Democratic opponents include former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and former Gov. Bill Ritter. Supporters say the ballot measure would protect public health, but opponents say it's a red herring meant as a de facto ban on fracking. The measure would ban oil and gas drilling on more than 80 percent of non-federal lands in the state, experts said. California voters seem poised to repeal a gas tax hike signed into law only seven months ago that added an extra 12 cents per gallon and up to a $175 license fee for vehicle registration.A University of California-Berkeley poll from October found nearly 58 percent of voters opposed the gas tax increase. The political battle heated up that month when gas tax opponents threatened to recall Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, for allegedly trying to mislead voters about the proposal. Gas tax repeal proponents are also backing an initiative to halt spending on California's high-speed rail project and use any unspent funds to improve roads. Tom Steyer Is Behind Ballot Measures In Arizona and NevadaLiberal billionaire Tom Steyer's campaign group, NextGen Climate Action is backing ballot measures in Arizona and Nevada that would require both states to get 50 percent of their electricity from renewables, like wind and solar. Steyer pumped more than $20 million into the campaign, but opponents accused Steyer's group of using "forged" and "fake" signatures to get the green energy mandate on Arizona's ballot. Steyer's group has spent more than $10 million in support of Nevada's green ballot measure. Pinnacle West, the parent company of Arizona's largest utility, spent more than $30 million opposing the green energy mandate, according to Ballotpedia. Under current laws, Arizona is required to get 15 percent of its electricity from renewables, and Nevada utilities are required to get 25 percent of their power from green sources. Florida To Decide On Offshore Drilling … And Vaping?Florida's Amendment 9 ballot measure, if enacted, would ban offshore oil and gas drilling in state waters and ban e-cigarettes from being used in enclosed workplaces. The measure is backed by Democratic and environmental groups opposed to offshore drilling, and apparently vaping indoors. It's opposed by Republicans, the oil and gas industry and the Consumer Advocates for Smoke-Free Alternatives Association, a group that advocates for e-cigarettes. Opponents have attacked the ballot measure for its odd pairing of issues — smoking and offshore drilling. Many opponents of offshore drilling ended up opposing the measure because of its prohibition on vaping indoors." hile our editorial board opposes offshore drilling in state waters, we also are philosophically opposed to the Constitution Revision Commission's 'bundling' of these unrelated issues into a single amendment," the editorial board of Treasure Coast Newspapers wrote in October.

601	The Daily Caller	right_bias	2017-04-23	Bill Nye Freaks Out After Scientist Schools Him On Climate Change Comedian Bill Nye accused CNN of doing a "disservice" to its viewers for inviting a well-respected physicist on Earth Day to argue about the legitimacy of man-made global warming. Nye, who is well known for hosting a children's TV show in the 1990s, scolded CNN's "New Day Saturday" panel Saturday for pitting his environmentalist pedigree against the climate skepticism of physicist William Happer. He also suggested the 24-news channel should instead drown out people like Happer with 98 scientists who believe in man-made global warming." nd I will say, much as I love the CNN, you're doing a disservice by having one climate change skeptic and not 97 or 98 scientists or engineers concerned about climate change," Nye said after the Princeton University academic suggested that it is a "myth" to believe that carbon dioxide is a pollutant causing widespread ecological destruction." arbon dioxide is a perfectly natural gas, it's just like water vapor, it's something that plants love. They grow better with more carbon dioxide, and you can see the greening of the earth already from the additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere," he added. He went on to say that Nye's views on science are backward. Science is based on observation, Happer said, "[a]nd if you observe what's happening to, for example, the temperature, the temperature is not rising nearly as fast as the alarmist computer models predicted. It's much, much less — factors of two or three less." Happer, a science adviser to President Donald Trump, made public his skeptical views on climate change in January. He told reporters that climate change is "tremendously exaggerated," adding that climate research is important, "but I think it's become sort of a cult movement in the last five years." Nye, who has a degree in engineering but no professional science background, called Happer's position "completely wrong," and suggested the physicist was "cherry picking a certain model." Some scientists maintain people like Nye are the ones cherry-picking data. Climate models predicted Antarctic sea ice would shrink, and that climate change would boost snowfall in the southern hemisphere, yet neither of those predictions have panned out. In fact, scientists now say "natural variability" is overwhelming their models. Scientists with Columbia University's Earth Institute, for instance, found there's been almost no change in Antarctica's snowfall. They blamed strong "natural variability" for the models' failures. Scientists have also warned that Antarctica has been losing 147 gigatons of ice per year for years, mostly from melting on the northern Antarctic Peninsula. A NASA conducted in 2015, meanwhile, found Antarctica's ice sheet increased in mass from 1992 to 2008, which essentially offset ice melting in the western part of the Antarctic. Nye, for his part, has been one of the most belligerent apostle for the environmental movement. He's even suggested that throwing global warming skeptics in jail could be a potential solution, during an interview with the conservative Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow.

151	politicususa	left_bias	2019-08-29	Trump responds to G7 by proposing easing Obama-era methane limits at oil and gas operations WASHINGTON (Reuters) – The Trump administration on Thursday proposed easing Obama-era limits on oil and gas industry emissions of methane, one of the main pollutants scientists link to climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said easing the 2016 regulation that targeted methane would save energy companies up to $123 million through 2025. The plan will undergo a period of public comment before being finalized, and environmental groups pledged court action to try to block repeal of the limits. The proposal "removes unnecessary and duplicative regulatory burdens from the oil and gas industry," EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a release. The EPA said it will keep rules issued in 2012 that limit emissions known as volatile organic compounds that cause smog and also control some methane emissions. Some large energy companies including BP favor federal regulation of methane, saying the regulatory certainty is preferable to a patchwork of varying rules by states and legal challenges by environmentalists. BP has said it is already taking steps to limit methane emissions. The move is the Trump administration's latest easing of rules designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including many put forth by his predecessor, President Barack Obama. President Donald Trump, who insists he is an environmentalist, has also relaxed rules on carbon emissions from vehicles and intends to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change. Concern about climate has heightened in recent weeks amid fires in the Arctic and the Amazon rainforest and melting of ice in Greenland. Democrats seeking their party's nomination in the 2020 U.S. presidential election will participate in a series of town halls on climate next week. In 2016, Obama's EPA issued the first rule limiting methane emissions from new oil and gas fracking operations including transport equipment. Thursday's proposal would repeal those regulations. The oil and gas business is the largest single source of methane emissions, a major factor in global warming. The gas has more than 80 times the heat-trapping potential of carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after it escapes into the atmosphere, scientists say. Susan Dio, chairman and president of BP America, supported federal regulation of methane in an opinion piece in the Houston Chronicle earlier this year calling it the "the best way to help further reduce and ultimately eliminate methane emissions industrywide." Environmentalists vowed to sue the administration over the proposal. "We simply cannot protect our children and grandchildren from climate catastrophe if EPA lets this industry off scot-free," said David Doniger, a climate and clean energy specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "If EPA moves forward with this reckless and sinister proposal, we will see them in court."	True	False	True	False	True

The loss for the administration means it now faces a high-profile examination of U.S. climate change policy during the trial that was due to begin on Oct. 29 in Eugene, Oregon but has since been postponed by the judge. Chief Justice John Roberts on Oct. 19 had temporarily put the case on hold while the court as a whole decided how to proceed. The Supreme Court's three-page order noted that the administration may still have grounds to take its arguments to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch indicated they would have granted the administration's request. There was no indication how Trump's new Supreme Court appointee, conservative Brett Kavanaugh, voted on the issue. In the lawsuit, 21 activists, ages 11 to 22, said federal officials violated their rights to due process under the U.S. Constitution by failing to adequately address carbon pollution such as emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The lawsuit was filed in 2015 against former President Barack Obama and government agencies in a federal court in Eugene, Oregon. Both the Obama and Trump administrations have failed in efforts to have the lawsuit thrown out. The administration has said a courtroom is not the appropriate venue for a debate on climate change policy." his suit is an attempt to redirect federal environmental and energy policies through the courts rather than through the political process, by asserting a new and unsupported fundamental due process right to certain climate conditions," Trump administration Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in court papers. Francisco noted that the plaintiffs are seeking to hold the U.S. government liable for the cumulative effects of carbon dioxide emissions "from every source in the world over decades." Lawyers for the young activists, led by Julia Olson of a Eugene-based group called Our Children's Trust that brought the lawsuit, have said their clients have suffered "irreparable harm" from the effects of a changing climate." his is a case about the fundamental rights of children and whether the actions of their government have deprived them of their inalienable rights," Olson said in court papers. On July 30, the high court rejected an earlier application by the Trump administration, calling it premature. Eugene, Oregon-based federal Judge Ann Aiken has repeatedly allowed the case to move forward to trial over the objections of the government. The trial will proceed if neither the high court nor the 9th Circuit intervene. Aiken said in an Oct. 15 ruling that although the case raised questions about the role of the judiciary delving into a matter of policy those concerns were not enough to warrant a dismissal of the entire case.

688	CNN	left_bias	2017-09-30	Trump administration swaps 'climate change' for 'resilience' The word choices by administration officials -- and the extent to which they're going to avoid referencing global warming altogether -- are notable in the aftermath of recent severe hurricanes and in the face of questions about what could have caused them. In the wake of Hurricane Irma, both Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long and acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke avoided explicitly answering whether the government needs to be more focused on climate change because of hurricanes. Instead, they both said the focus should be on resiliency." Regardless of what causes disasters, it's our job within the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA to manage the consequences," Long told CNN. "The only way we become resilient as a nation is we have to create that true culture of preparedness among our citizenry, which we do not have, and then we also have to look how we move forward when it comes to infrastructure protection." Duke echoed Long's thoughts on the need for "resilience." "We live in a changing world, and as the FEMA administrator said, we always have to look at not just the response, but the preparedness and the resilience," Duke said. "And I think it's important that as we come together as a country, we look at the changes in our world and make sure that in planning and response, that we are adapting properly." Trump dismisses climate change question by contradicting himself on hurricanes Other departments are also adopting the language replacement, in some cases making unannounced changes and replacements to their websites and names of programs. In February, shortly after President Donald Trump took office, the​ ​Department​ of​ ​Transportation and Federal​ ​Highway​ ​Administration​ ​changed language​ ​across​ its website​ ​relating​ ​to​ ​the environmental​ ​effects​ ​of transportation. The changes swapped words like "adaptation" with resilience and also renamed the "Sustainable Transport and Climate Change Team" to "The Sustainable Transportation and Resilience Team," according to a Environmental​ ​Data​ ​and​ ​Governance​ ​Initiative Website​ ​Tracking​ ​ report That same month, the Environmental Protection Agency removed all mention of climate change from its water utilities programs. The "Climate Ready Water Utilities" program was renamed to "Creating Resilient Water Utilities." Other references to climate change were also scrubbed from the website, Inside Climate News first reported. Over at the USDA, an internal memo obtained by CNN that was shared in the first days of the administration to staffers gave specific guidance to ditch the term "climate change adaptation" and instead opt for "resilience to weather extremes." The terms resilience and resiliency rose to popularity in the US government during former President Barack Obama's administration, used specifically to denote preparing something to ward off the future effects of climate change. For example, following Superstorm Sandy, the Department of Housing and Urban Development established a first-of-its-kind competition called the National Disaster Resilience Competition. The aim of the competition was to award grants to communities hit by natural disasters to fund rebuilding them to better weather future events worsened by climate change. "The idea is when dollars are spent to rebuild, you don't just want to rebuild the same old way, you want to rebuild in a way that is smarter and makes it less likely that they will be effected the same way in the future storms -- that's resiliency," former HUD Secretary Julian Castro, who awarded the grant at the time, told CNN. "There's no question that climate change is at least a contributing factor to some of the intensity of these natural disasters. ... The administration ought to take that into consideration and not try to decouple those two," Castro said. "The verbal judo they are trying to do doesn't serve local communities at all." But administration officials counter that resiliency can have a dual meaning -- even one that means essentially the same thing, but without the overt climate change undertones. "Resilience came into our nomenclature in our last administration but that doesn't mean that it's a verboten word any longer," said Brian Sullivan, a HUD spokesman. "The last administration made that very direct connection between the use of that word and words like sustainability with climate change and, while there may be a reluctance to do that now, I don't think that means folks are any less committed to making sure the next storm is less costly," Sullivan said. While Sullivan acknowledged that there's been an intentional shift of language at the department, especially as the topic of climate change continues to be discussed -- or avoided -- hand-in-hand with storm preparedness, he argues that at the end of the day, the administration has the same goals for rebuilding communities. "I don't know if there's an operating definition of what resilience means," he said. "Regardless of why you're doing it, what you're doing would be the same whatever motivates you. Whether you believe in climate change or you don't, you are embarking on some future activity. We could tie this to climate change, or we could tie it to saving taxpayer money."

642	RedState	right_bias	2017-10-09	Scott Pruitt Gets Ready to Pull the Plug on Obama's Job-Killing Clean Power Plan Back in October 2015, Barack Obama's EPA finalized a 460-page rule titled "Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units," aka the Clean Power Plan. This was a part of Obama's "pen and phone" way of ruling the country. (As an aside, did you ever see anyone on the left bitch about Obama using the power of the presidency to make policy and weigh in on political and cultural issues the way some on the right bitch about Trump doing it? Did you ever stop to wonder what they know that the current belly-achers don't?)The purpose of this rule was breathtaking. Using the anthropogenic global warming scaremongering and specious public health predictions, the Clean Power Plan essentially put the US coal industry out of business. Since that time the rule has been mired in court challenges and it produced the first instance in history where the Supreme Court presumed a rule was unreasonable before a lower court ruled on the issue:"The Supreme Court dealt a blow to President Obama's signature climate change initiative Tuesday by halting the administration's effort to reduce pollution from coal-fired power plants while a legal battle rages on. The move by the court's five conservative members was a shock to environmentalists, who had hoped the justices would deny — as a federal appeals court did last month — a petition filed by 29 mostly Republican-led states and industry leaders. Now the Environmental Protection Agency must halt enforcement of the so-called "Clean Power Plan" until the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit decides on the merits of the GOP-industry lawsuit against it. Oral arguments are set for early June. Even if the plan is upheld at the lower court, it could not be implemented until the Supreme Court has had the final word. That likely would push the battle into 2017 or beyond. In September 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump gave an economic policy speech in which he specifically targeted the Clean Power Plan:Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he would repeal four key Environmental Protection Agency regulations as president, leading one environmental group to call his plans a "dumpster fire." During an economic policy speech in New York, Trump said he would eliminate the Clean Power Plan and the Waters of the United States rule. In a fact sheet released accompanying the speech, Trump's campaign said he would scale back the latest regulations on ozone pollution and eliminate the EPA's Renewable Identification Number program, which is part of the Renewable Fuel Standard program. Trump said the regulations harm U.S. businesses and getting rid of them would help kick-start the economy. "This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plans in America," Trump said of the Clean Power Plan. " They're shutting down all over the country. Remember what Hillary Clinton said? She wants to shut down the miners, just like she wants to shut down the steel mills and steel workers." In late March, President Trump signed an executive order directing the EPA to review the Clean Power Plan:Now it is reported that tomorrow the EPA will being the process of withdrawing the Clean Power Plan. What the EPA is doing is proposing a rule to rescind the existing rule and then it will undertake another administrative rule making process to ask for public input on what a new rule should contain, and finally a new rule will be drafted. I'm sure Scott Pruitt would prefer to scrap this whole thing, unfortunately, the US Supreme Court 2007 decision, Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, says that EPA regulation of carbon dioxide is actually required by the Clean Air Act and so non-regulation is legally off the table unless Congress acts (that was a joke). The sum total of this is to take this issue out of the courts and then give the environmental nazis a new chew toy to play with for several years. In the meantime, hopefully Congress will act (again that was a joke) to limit the reach of the Clean Air Act and the ability of activists to use that law to wreak havoc on our economy and communities.

527	bbc	left_center_bias	2018-10-10	'Flexitarian' diets key to feeding people in a warming world If the world wants to limit climate change, water scarcity and pollution, then we all need to embrace "flexitarian" diets, say scientists. This means eating mainly plant-based foods, and is one of three key steps towards a sustainable future for all in 2050, they say. Food waste will need to be halved and farming practices will also have to improve, according to the study. Without action, the impacts of the food system could increase by up to 90%. Fast on the heels of the landmark report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) comes this new study on how food production and consumption impact major threats to the planet. The authors say that the food system has a number of significant environmental impacts including being a major driver of climate change, depleting freshwater and pollution through excessive use of nitrogen and phosphorous. The study says that thanks to the population and income growth expected between 2010 and 2050, these impacts could grow between 50-90%. This could push our world beyond its planetary boundaries, which the authors say represent a "safe operating space for humanity on a stable Earth system". However the study finds that no single solution will avert the dangers, so a combined approach is needed. So when it comes to climate change, the authors looked at what they called a "flexitarian diet"." We can eat a range of healthy diets but what they all have in common, according to the latest scientific evidence, is that they are all relatively plant based," said lead author Dr Marco Springmann from the University of Oxford." You can go from a diet that has small amounts of animal products, some might call it a Mediterranean based diet, we call it a flexitarian diet, over to a pescatarian, vegetarian or vegan diet - we tried to stay with the most conservative one of these which in our view is the flexitarian one, but even this has only one serving of red meat per week." If the world moved to this type of diet, the study found that greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture would be reduced by more than half. But as well as altering diets, the research says that farming practices need to change significantly. This involves boosting yields from existing cropland, improving water management and restricting and recycling fertiliser use." We looked at improving agricultural yields in particular of more health sensitive crops like fruit, vegetables and legumes," said Dr Springmann." In the past there has been lots of invest in the stable grains like maize and corn, but now we really need to move it to the crops we need more of. We also looked at increasing the efficiency of water use, and we looked at better monitoring and recycling of fertiliser - lots of it is lost and it runs off into rivers and causes dead zones in the oceans." In addition, the study found that halving the amount of food lost to waste would reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture by 16%." Tackling food loss and waste will require measures across the entire food chain, from storage, and transport, over food packaging and labelling to changes in legislation and business behaviour that promote zero-waste supply chains," said Fabrice de Clerck, director of science at EAT who funded the study. The key element is that these three solutions must be implemented together." Feeding a world population of 10 billion people is possible - yet only if we change the way we eat, and the way we produce food," said Johan Rockström, director designate of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who is one of the authors of the study." All measures combined can result in keeping healthy both planet and people." The study has been published in the journal Nature.	True	False	False	False	False

From the Hill:Greta Thunberg's plan for carbon-free travel was contradicted when her sailboat captain flew across the Atlantic Ocean to pick her up. Thunberg, 16, has been on a tour of North America to raise awareness for climate change. As part of her pledge to cut back carbon dioxide emissions to save the planet, Thunberg vowed not to travel by air to limit her carbon footprint while she tours. The plan for "zero emissions" travel was subverted when Thunberg's yacht captain, Nikki Henderson, 26, flew to the United States from England, burning roughly two or three tons of carbon CO2 in the process. Thunberg and her father, who has traveled North America throughout his daughter's activist tour, could have flown aboard the same flight and burned just as much CO2. Ironically, she failed because of left-wing communist protesters in Chile:Henderson was forced to make the flight last second because protests in Chile caused the U.N.'s Cop25 climate summit to be moved to Madrid, Spain. Thunberg was set to speak at the conference but needed to leave the U.S. sooner than expected.I mean, you really think the entire world is going to come to a screeching halt for carbon emissions when you can't even organize a publicity stunt with your own standards? No wonder celebs opt to be complete and utter hypocrites instead of actually trying to get carbon neutral. And we all kinda see what is happening here – if they can't do it now, then why would we believe that they would be carbon free after they force all of us to live in backwards slums?

748	The Guardian	left_center_bias	2017-10-14	Geoengineering is not a quick fix for climate change, experts warn Trump Leading climate scientists have warned that geoengineering research could be hijacked by climate change deniers as an excuse not to reduce CO2 emissions, citing the US administration under Donald Trump as a major threat to their work. David Keith, a solar geoengineering (GE) expert at Harvard University has said there is a real danger that his work could be exploited by those who oppose action on emissions, at the same time as he defended himself and colleagues from the claims GE strengthens the argument for abandoning the targets set by the Paris climate agreement." ne of the main concerns I and everyone involved in this have, is that Trump might tweet 'geoengineering solves everything – we don't have to bother about emissions.' That would break the slow-moving agreement among many environmental groups that sound research in this field makes sense," Keith said on the sidelines of the Climate Engineering Conference (CEC) in Berlin. Indeed, utterances from people in or close to the Trump administration – most notably GE proponent secretary of state Rex Tillerson, who has referred to climate change as "just an engineering problem" – make it clear they either tacitly or directly support the idea of climate engineering. Earlier this year, Keith, a professor of applied physics at Harvard announced plans to conduct an outdoor trial into stratospheric aerosol injection, involving launching a high-altitude balloon that will spray a small quantity of reflective particles into the stratosphere. Keith believes the experiment may help to measure the feasibility and risks involved in GE, an umbrella term for a range of techniques to deliberately adjust the climate in an effort to mitigate global warming. They include reflecting sunlight from space, adding huge quantities of lime or iron to the oceans, pumping deep cold nutrient-rich waters to the surface of oceans and irrigating vast swaths of desert to grow trees. Supporters of research into geoengineering argue that its techniques – roughly-speaking divided into carbon dioxide removal (CDR, or negative emission technologies) which removes greenhouse gases, and solar-radiation management (SRM or solar geoengineering) which reduces the amount of solar energy warming the planet – could help to lessen some of the consequences of climate change. However, the common consensus is that the techniques should be used in addition to reductions in CO2 emissions. This week's conference drew attention to the huge risks involved." ll the techniques being proposed have potentially severe environmental impacts," said Silvia Ribeiro of the ETC Group, leading campaign monitors of new technologies and their possible impact on the world's poorest." hey also ignore the question as to why there's not enough political will to have done more to tackle climate change until now and they in turn serve to justify the inaction," she added. Concerns focus on techniques such as stratospheric aerosol injection, which some experts say has the potential to reduce the amount of rain from Asian and African monsoons and could have a devastating impact on the food supply of billions of people. Aerosol injection also has the potential to reduce the ozone layer and heighten the risk of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Other possible side effects of GE may be an increase in ocean acidification, a change in weather patterns, a rapid rise in temperatures, and a huge uptake in the use of agricultural land, all of which could prompt mass migration of millions of climate change refugees. But scientists such as Keith, and Mark Lawrence, scientific director of the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (IASS) in Potsdam, argue that with the Paris agreement goals to limit temperature rise to two degrees or less, almost impossible to achieve, the world has little choice than to thoroughly explore technical intervention and the potential it has to avoid global disaster." t will be very difficult to achieve the Paris agreement calls without some form of climate engineering," Lawrence said. "It's not impossible, but it's hard to imagine we would make the major changes in our infrastructure and lifestyles in the time necessary." Keith also dismissed the view that climate engineers like himself were on a mission to prove that climate engineering worked at all costs, or else see the importance of decades of their life's work evaporate." t the best climate engineering is a supplement, and it could be that we shouldn't do it," he insisted. "Our work is to inform better choices and it would actually be very useful to know for sure it didn't work. Right now there are heads of state and others in leadership who are explicitly assuming it could work, that it's there if we need it. But let's say we found something deep in the climate models which suggested we were overoptimistic about solar geoengineering, then I would say 'abandon it'. That would be great. I'd love to publish that."	False	False	False	False	False
655	The Daily Caller	right_bias	2017-06-03	Trudeau Team 'Disappointed' Over U.S. Exit From Paris Climate Accord Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his "climate change" minister Catherine McKenna are both "disappointed" over President Donald Trump's decision to break with the Paris climate accord. Trudeau and Trump exchanged words over the phone on Thursday night when the prime minister "expressed his disappointment with the president's decision," according to a news release from the Prime Minister's Office. Through crestfallen, Trudeau reiterated to the president "Canada's continued commitment to working internationally to address climate change. This is about an ambitious and unshakable desire to leave a cleaner, healthier and more sustainable planet for our kids and for generations to come." Despite the lofty objectives, when Trudeau signed the Paris accord he was widely criticized in Canada by environmentalists for selling out to an agreement that they said was far too lenient on greenhouse gas producers. Nonetheless, Liberal Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna also found Trump's resolve to extricate the U.S. from the accord "deeply disappointing" and even suggested that the president will be missing out from the "inevitable" increase in green energy jobs that climate change proponents believe will soon be mushrooming around the world." he clean-growth economy is where the world is going and Canada is going to be part of it," McKenna said Thursday on Parliament Hill." anada wants to create good jobs, and wants to grow our economy and create opportunities for business. We want to be there, we want to be providing solutions for the world. We know where we're going." However, the U.S. move might well affect Trudeau's plans to implement a national carbon tax and his overall environmental agenda that many critics say will make the Canadian economy less competitive than its American counterpart. With the North American Free Trade Agreement on the cusp of renegotiation, environmental policy could well become integral to reaching a new agreement.	True	False	True	False	False
245	breitbart	questionable_source	2019-12-13	Young Conservatives Balk at Republicans' Climate Change Stance, Launch Campaign for Carbon Tax The generation that has grown up with the constant drumbeat of manmade climate change is now shaping public policy, including some young conservatives who have launched a nationwide campaign in support of a carbon tax. The Thomson Reuters Foundation reported on the campaign, which runs counter to the stance of the Republican Party and President Donald Trump that the issue is more about globalization than saving the planet:Drawn from Republican groups on more than two dozen university campuses, the Young Conservatives for Carbon Dividends called for laws to tax oil, natural gas and coal producers of planet-warming greenhouse gases. The taxation plan would make fossil fuels more costly while the resulting revenues would go to taxpayers. "We claim to be the party that cares about the future that our children will inherit, and we need climate policy that reflects that," said Kiera O'Brien, 21, a senior at Harvard University who co-founded the group." e are offering up what we see as the common sense solution and the way forward for the party," O'Brien said in the Reuters article. The article pointed out that Trump has rejected the climate doomsday scenario and has instead acted to help the U.S. energy sector by slashing regulations and withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord, both policies aimed at helping American workers and the economy. The college Republicans behind the carbon tax campaign said the Party should have, ahead of the 2020 election, a climate change plan in place. Their plan includes an initial $40-a-ton tax on carbon dioxide – a greenhouse gas – at mines, wells, and ports where products are produced. That tax rate would increase over time, according to Reuters.O'Brien said the plan includes a family of four receiving $2,000 a year from the carbon tax revenues to help with higher energy costs. The plan "harnesses the power of the free market to solve climate change through innovation," O'Brien said. "Our plan would provide incentives for companies and individuals to lower emissions in ways they think are best." The campaign will connect young conservatives with Republican lawmakers around the country to talk about climate policy. At least one older Republican backs the idea." he key here is the dividend – back to the people," former Sen. Trent Lott (R-MS), who supports the young group, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation." t's not sustainable for Republicans, through the leadership, to say 'We just don't want to talk about this,'" Lott said.

435	thehuffingtonpost	left_bias	2018-12-04	Ryan Zinke To Oil Reps: 'We've Gotten A Lot Better As Industry' It was clear Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke felt at home Tuesday addressing representatives of the industry that was a top donor to his congressional campaigns. It's the same industry that the Trump administration has worked so hard to prop up over the last two years, and that Zinke now regulates as chief steward of America's natural resources."  see a lot of familiar faces," he told the National Petroleum Council during its meeting in Washington, D.C., before launching into a series of go-to talking points about the importance of producing domestic energy, namely fossil fuels, and downplaying the dire conclusions of a recent federal climate report." e want to embrace better stewardship. We want to embrace reliability. In order to get there, we have to understand the technology. And in order to understand it, quite frankly, we have to work with you," he said. "I've been criticized [for] saying we want to work with you. I'll take the criticism." Zinke was referring to controversial comments he made in September during a keynote speech at the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association's meeting in Lafayette, Louisiana. "Our government should work for you," he told the oil and gas trade group, according to a post by the association. As head of the Interior Department, Zinke oversees some 500 million acres of land, or one-fifth of the United States, and 1.7 billion acres on the Outer Continental Shelf. It's a job that comes with the sometimes conflicting tasks of preserving and protecting public lands and waters for future generations while also setting the policies that govern extracting natural resources from them. Zinke has said that he's succeeded in "striking the right balance," but conservation efforts have taken a clear backseat as the administration has pushed forward with its "energy dominance" agenda. There were moments during Tuesday's speech where Zinke sounded like a seasoned oil man. He said he is "bullish" on energy and expects that within two years the U.S. will be "marching real close to" producing 14 million barrels of oil per day. And he agrees with Russian President Vladimir Putin that $60 per barrel is "a good spot to keep the economic engine" in good shape, he said." e've gotten a lot better as industry," Zinke said, quickly correcting himself. "You've gotten a lot better." He pointed to energy producers' success with domestic shale production, noting that companies have been able to turn a profit on oil from the Bakken fields in Montana and North Dakota when prices have been at around $30 per barrel. That, he said, "shows you how good we are and efficient we are." Zinke also saw the friendly atmosphere as an opportunity to, once again, cast doubt on the latest federal climate assessment. The 1,600-page report was issued by 13 federal agencies, including Interior, and released on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving ― a move that many saw as an administrative attempt to bury the findings. Like so many other climate reports before it, the assessment warns that greenhouse gas emissions have put the planet on a path toward catastrophic climate change. But instead of blasting the report's authors ― there are more than 300 ― for basing their findings on the most extreme scenarios, a false claim that he and the White House pushed last week, Zinke on Tuesday blamed the media among other targets." he media focused on worst-case scenarios, which statistically we may not even be able to reach," he said. "The facts of the matter is observable data, climate change is more toward the peace time," he added, comparing the document to international relations. "It's kind of like the military," he said. "There's peace time and there's global nuclear combat. The media focused on global nuclear combat." A lot of the millennials look at that report and they don't look at the models," instead focusing on "rising sea levels that statistically and data-wise we don't know," he said. Zinke boasted to the room full of oil executives who have been primary beneficiaries of the Trump administration's denial of climate science and energy-dominance agenda, that the U.S. has "led the charge" in reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. His "concern" as the leader of the federal agency, he said, is that "we need to be better at emphasizing the case for American energy."	False	False	False	False	True
277	rt	questionable_source	2019-07-14	Community showdown with bottled water plant gets surprise twist when company reveals its own emails Bottled water firm Crystal Geyser's heavily-protested plans for a plant in Washington state are all but dashed, after company execs accidentally sent an internal email calling the operation "dead" to the local press. Crystal Geyser bottles natural spring water and sells it to thirsty Americans, with nearly one in five consumers drinking its beverages every month. However, few are happy to live near the firm's bottling plants, where they say heavy traffic disturbs their sleep and the company's water collection activities threaten endangered species and destroy the "rural character" of their areas. Earlier this year, Crystal Geyser bought land in Lewis County, Washington. The company planned on building a 100,000 square foot plant that would extract 400 gallons of water per minute from nearby springs. At present, Crystal Geyser needs a county permit to begin operations. However, in an email accidentally sent to The Chronicle but intended for a higher-up, Chief Operating Officer Page Beykpour said that the plan is likely "dead because the opposition has successfully convinced officials and the media against us." Locals did come out in force against the plant, with concerned citizens flooding council meetings since the plans were announced last month. Facebook groups have sprung up to oppose the plant, and the local tribal council voted unanimously against it. Beykpour offered his boss two "long shot" options to push back against the public outcry. Option one involved hiring a PR firm to manufacture fake "grassroots" support for the facility and "change the conversation." With pro-corporate protesters likely to raise some eyebrows, he outlined a more radical approach: sue locals in the area for past damages to the local water system to bring "them to the table." If both options were to fail, Beykpour suggested "we dump this site" and move on. Once the paper got a hold of the email, Crystal Geyser went into panic mode. The newspaper claims Beykpour called the Chronicle and "pleaded for the email not to be published," and admitted that the company is still mulling suing its neighbors. In his email, Beykpour had claimed the Chronicle was "in bed with the opposition."A lawyer representing Crystal Geyser called the newspaper and threatened legal action for running the story. The Chronicle rubbished the threat, quoting a media law expert who stated that the company's email screw-up was its own fault and not the newspaper's. RT has reached out to Crystal Geyser for comment, and is awaiting a response. Crystal Geyser is no stranger to local anger. Residents in Mount Shasta, California were furious when the company announced plans to bottle water from a local aquefier in 2014, at a time when the state was threatened by drought and Californians faced mandatory water-use restrictions. In 2018, the company was accused of illegally disposing of arsenic-tainted wastewater from another of its California plants. According to a 16-count indictment, Crystal Geyser discharged the toxic waste into a pond that staff dubbed the "arsenic pond," and then worked with two waste disposal firms to illegally transport the arsenic to a plant without a license to treat it.

According to the poll, which has a 3.4% margin of error, 67% of Democrats, 54% of independents, and 33% of Republicans believe that Democrat Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom and Republican businessman John Cox's views on environmental issues will impact how they vote. So far, Newsom holds a 24-point lead over Cox, who beat former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigos in the June primary to proceed to the November general election. Meanwhile, the PPIC poll also found that "likely voters see drought and water supply as the top environmental issue facing the state, followed by air pollution; a majority (58%) support a water bond on the November ballot"; and noted that "[a] strong majority of likely voters (69%) say that the effects of global warming have already begun." In an interview with the Flash Report this week, Cox said water, housing affordability, and the gas tax are the three main issues he wants to tackle. He reportedly blamed "out-of-touch-elites" for the Golden State's water issues, and called Newsom the "poster boy" for these problems. Environmental issues have been a strong point for Newsom, who last year said he would use specific environmental laws in California to stop President Donald Trump's border wall from being built. For all the talk about the importance of environmental issues to voters in the deep blue state of California, the topic does not seem to do well for media outlets — even left-wing ones. Chris Hayes of MSNBC recently said networks mostly try to avoid discussing environmental issues related to the topic of climate change because "almost without exception. every single time we've covered it's been a palpable ratings killer. so the incentives are not great."

304	breitbart	questionable_source	2019-09-09	Pope Francis: Loss of Biodiversity Jeopardizes Earth's Future "Your lovely island of Madagascar is rich in plant and animal biodiversity, yet this treasure is especially threatened by excessive deforestation, from which some profit," Pope Francis told authorities and diplomats on Saturday." he deterioration of that biodiversity compromises the future of the country and of the earth, our common home," he warned. The pope went on to enumerate his vision of the problem, while also recognizing that many poor people derive their livelihood from activities that threaten the environment." s you know, the last forests are menaced by forest fires, poaching, the unrestricted cutting down of valuable woodlands," he said. "Plant and animal biodiversity is endangered by contraband and illegal exportation." It is also true, however, that, for the peoples concerned, a number of activities harmful to the environment at present ensure their survival. So it is important to create jobs and activities that generate income, while protecting the environment and helping people to emerge from poverty," he declared. The pontiff tied together social and ecological problems, insisting that the two are intimately intertwined." e are faced not with two separate crises, one environmental and the other social, but rather with one complex crisis which is both social and environmental," he said." n a word, there can be no true ecological approach or effective efforts to safeguard the environment without the attainment of a social justice capable of respecting the right to the common destination of earth's goods, not only of present generations, but also of those yet to come," he said. Pope Francis has made the care of the environment a central theme of his six-year pontificate, returning again and again to issues of ecological responsibility, the dangers of carbon emissions, and the scourge of climate change. In 2015, he became the first pope in history to devote an entire encyclical letter to the topic of the environment with the publication of Laudato Si ("Praised Be"), urging Christians to become more ecologically aware. In that text, the pontiff said that the earth "is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth" as "once beautiful landscapes are now covered with rubbish." He also denounced a failure to recycle paper and other resources, while calling climate change "a global problem with grave implications" and "one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day." Citing "scientific studies," the pontiff said that "most global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen oxides and others) released mainly as a result of human activity."

878	RT	questionable_source	2017-07-14	US approves Alaska offshore oil & gas drilling, enraging environmental groups The US arm of a European multinational oil and gas company has been approved to begin exploratory drilling in Alaska's Beaufort Sea. Environmentalists argue the Trump administration doesn't have the authority for such a move and it would endanger land and marine life. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) gave conditional approval late Wednesday to Eni US, the US subsidiary of the Italian company Eni S.p.A., to drill four exploration wells from Spy Island, an artificial island created in the Beaufort Sea in Alaska. Drilling can only be conducted in the winter months, and is scheduled to begin in December 2017 and end in May 2019, BOEM said. The permit is for preparatory work, and does not authorize Eni to produce oil." ver the past 30 days BOEM has been carefully evaluating the EP (exploration plan) in accordance with federal law and regulations…[including] site-specific Environmental Assessment…[and] conclude with a Finding of No Significant Impact," BEOM said in a statement. The Obama administration banned oil and gas exploration in most of the US's Arctic Ocean and Atlantic Ocean waters last year, but President Donald Trump ordered Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in April to review the ban with the goal of opening up offshore areas for oil and gas drilling. Eni's lease was due to expire at the end of 2017, according to Kristen Monsell, an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity. The Trump administration provided the public only 21 days to review and comment on the exploration plan and only 10 days to comment on scoping for environmental assessment, according to Monsell." pproving this Arctic drilling plan at the 11th hour makes a dangerous project even riskier," Monsell told the Guardian. "An oil spill here would do incredible damage, and it'd be impossible to clean up." The Center for Biological Diversity, Greenpeace and REDOIL, a coalition of Alaska native groups, sued the Trump administration on May 3, citing the risk of offshore oil and gas exploration development to local communities and wildlife. The lawsuit also argued that Trump's reversal of the ban exceeded his constitutional authority and was thus unlawful. In the lawsuit, the groups argued the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas are still undeveloped and are home to a rich array of unique wildlife species including polar bears, walruses, whales, seals, other mammals, birds and fish, some of which are classified as threatened or endangered." ome of these animals also support thriving indigenous Alaska Native cultural and subsistence activities," stated the complaint. "Several Arctic mammals, including polar bears and bearded seals, have been listed under the ESA (Endangered Species Act)." The region serves as important nurseries, feeding grounds and transit routes for marine animals. Seismic surveys and drilling activities could cause disruption and threaten wildlife directly. The area is "remote and foreboding," the complaint said. In winter, the seas are covered in ice and shrouded in darkness, it is prone to storms and fog, and there is little infrastructure to support industrial activity, with just small communities, and few jet runways. The region is hundreds of miles from the nearest Coast Guard station. Mentioned in the complaint is Shell Oil's exploratory adventures in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas in 2012, which led to a series of problems, mistakes and violations of environmental laws. During testing in the placid waters of Puget Sound, Shell destroyed its oil spill containment drone. On the way north, its drillship, the Noble Discoverer, dragged its anchor and nearly ran aground while moored near an Alaskan island. Once at the drill site in the Chukchi Sea, Shell had to undertake an emergency maneuver to relocate the drillship to avoid a large ice floe. On its way back from the Beaufort Sea, it lost control of its drilling vessel, the Kulluk, which ran aground in the Gulf of Alaska in severe weather and had to be towed to Seattle, Washington and then scrapped. The US Coast Guard cited the Noble Discoverer for numerous deficiencies after the drilling season, and the EPA determined Shell had violated the Clean Air Act during its drilling efforts and fined the company $1.1 million. Its drilling contractor pleaded guilty to eight felony offenses relating to environmental pollution and safety and agreed to pay $12.2 million in fines.	False	False	True	False	True
216	bbc	left_center_bias	2019-07-20	Some unexpected consequences of extreme heat This weekend, close to 200 million Americans will face temperatures of 90F (32C) and higher. Add in humidity, and many cities across the East Coast and Midwest will be feeling more like 110F (43C). Heat waves have killed more people on average than any other extreme weather event in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Officials define extreme heat as a period of two to three days of high heat and humidity with temperatures above 90F (32C). On the heels of earth's hottest June on record, the US National Weather Service (NWS) estimates over 100 record-high minimum temperatures could be set as the heat lingers even past sunset. Here's what that sort of heat can do. Air-conditioning is used in 87% of US homes, according to a 2018 report by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). During heat waves, air conditioning use stresses power grids and can lead to city-wide outages. In cities, that means millions of units - including those on cars and buses and trains - constantly pushing out heat into the atmosphere. Studies have found the extra heat from air-conditioning can raise temperatures by as much as 2C. And when it gets hotter, our thermostats turn lower and the cycle continues. But it goes further than just an ever-hotter summer season - the emissions from air conditioners and their refrigerants is contributing to climate change. The man-made greenhouse gases used in air conditoners, called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), are thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In cities, the cycle is also exacerbated by all the concrete, asphalt, steel and glass, creating an urban heat island. When temperatures get too high, planes get grounded. Extreme heat reduces air density and the amount of lift a plane can get to take-off. Temperatures of 120F (49C) saw dozens of flights cancelled in Phoenix during a 2017 heatwave. Smaller planes are affected first, but larger Boeing or Airbus jets have maximum operating temperatures around 126F (52C), AZ Central reported. In a heat wave, concrete and asphalt don't fare well. Asphalt warps and melts. Concrete, if water is involved, can sometimes explode or break open. This week, local media in Kansas has reported several instances of cracked and buckled roads as temperatures rise. In Iowa, one city mayor said old concrete roads soaked with floodwaters from this spring are now exploding and damaging sewer lines. The NWS outpost in Omaha, Nebraska, demonstrated just how hot vehicles can get in heat waves by cooking American biscuits on a dash. The temperatures reached a high of 185F (85C) - not quite enough for a proper bake, but certainly too hot for humans or animals to survive in. According to the National Weather Service, 21 young children have died in hot cars this year. Unsurprisingly, as everything warms up in a heat wave, anything metal gets even hotter. When it comes to power lines, this can cause dangerously low sagging. If lines droop low enough to touch the ground or trees, they can short out. Kinks can form on train rails when the metal expands. In 2012, a "heat kink" caused a 32-car-long freight train to derail and fly off an overpass; a similar derailment happened in 2017. Experts told Fox 26 News more than 2,100 trains have been derailed in the last 40 years because of these heat warps. Metal components in draw-bridges can expand and become inoperable - last year, Chicago firefighters had to hose down a downtown draw-bridge so it could be used. Crops can also feel the heat. Farmers across the Midwest are warning that vegetables can wilt in the heat and farms will lose productivity - worsening the situation after a historic flooding season this spring. Soybean farmers also say the dry conditions could cause an increase in spider mites and other plant diseases. Extreme heat makes pollution worse, which can be dangerous for the very young, the elderly and anyone with respiratory diseases. In the nation's capital, where the mayor has declared a heat emergency, officials warned that air quality would reach unhealthy levels for these sensitive groups over the weekend.

718	MotherJones	left_bias	2017-05-15	Here's a Crazy Story About Donald Trump Falling for an Internet Hoax President Donald Trump has been a climate change denier for years, alleging that global warming is a Chinese invention and declaring that cold winter days prove that it's a hoax. Perhaps not surprisingly, his staff seems to share these views. According to Politico, Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland recently tried to get Trump riled up about climate change with a bit of fake news. McFarland reportedly slipped Trump two Time magazine cover stories. One was supposedly from the 1970s and warned about a coming ice age. The other, from 2007, discussed how to survive global warming. But there was one glaring problem: The 1970s cover was a hoax. In 2007, Time published a cover story titled, "The Global Warming Survival Guide." Sometime after that, internet hoaxers doctored the cover to instead say "How to Survive the Coming Ice Age" and alleged that it was a 1977 cover. The hoax spread quickly, and climate deniers used it to argue that in the 1970s, scientists were actually worried about global cooling—and since it didn't happen then, the public shouldn't believe warnings about global warming now. The hoax seems to have had its intended effect on Trump, who, according to Politico, "quickly got lathered up about the media's hypocrisy." A White House official defended McFarland in an interview with Politico, calling the Time hoax "fake but accurate." The White House didn't respond to a request for comment from Mother Jones. While the Time global cooling cover story never existed, it's certainly true that some media outlets, including Time, ran stories in the 70s warning about global cooling. One, published by Newsweek, is a favorite of climate deniers. Scientific American explained Newsweek's global cooling story in 2014:But global cooling was never a popular theory among scientists. Even as some news outlets were writing about it, notes Scientific American, a counter theory about a warming planet was already on the rise. In fact, a survey of peer-reviewed scientific papers from 1969 to 1975 shows that the majority of scientists predicted that carbon dioxide levels would rise, causing temperatures to rise as well. Scientists have since reached an overwhelming consensus: The planet is getting warmer, and humans are to blame. But this hasn't stopped climate deniers from citing the old stories as evidence that contemporary news reports about climate change shouldn't be believed.

769	Yahoo News	left_center_bias	2017-05-31	European Commission head says Trump doesn't understand how Paris Agreement works European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said President Trump doesn't seem to understand that he can't immediately yank the United States out of the Paris Agreement on climate change." hat's not how it works. The Americans can't just leave the climate protection agreement," Juncker said Wednesday, according to a translation from NBC News. "Mr. Trump believes that because he doesn't get close enough to the dossiers to fully understand them." Reports circulated Wednesday that Trump had decided to withdraw from the international pact — which has been signed by every country in the world except Nicaragua and Syria — but as of late afternoon there was no formal announcement. Juncker, the former prime minister of Luxembourg, has been leading the European Commission, the civil service of the European Union's executive branch in Brussels, since November 2014. During a student conference on Europe's future, he explained that the United States would have to wait three to four years after the agreement took effect in November 2016 before leaving. Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk represented the European Union at last week's Group of Seven (G7) summit in Taormina, a small town in Sicily. They met with leaders from the seven democracies with the world's most developed economies: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Amid talk of combating terrorism and the global economy, they also discussed international efforts to fight climate change. These conversations come at a particularly fraught time because Trump, who does not share his predecessor Barack Obama's commitment to clean energy, has been reviewing the United States' environmental policies. According to a translation from NBC News, Juncker said that they attempted to explain to Trump that he could not simply pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement because the treaty contains safeguards to prevent exactly that." o this notion, 'I am Trump, I am American, America first and I'm going to get out of it' — that won't happen," he continued. "We tried to explain that to Mr. Trump in Taormina in clear German sentences. It seems our attempt failed." He said that "the law is the law" and it must be obeyed regardless of what Trump thinks, adding somewhat sardonically that not everything in international agreements is fake news. On Wednesday morning, Axios published a report citing two sources with "direct knowledge of the decision" that Trump was planning to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. Shortly after the news spread, Trump tweeted that he would be announcing his decision regarding the international agreement within the next few days. Later Wednesday, during a meeting with Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc of Vietnam at the White House, Trump dodged a question about whether he still thinks that climate change is a hoax. When asked if he was "leaning in a direction" concerning Paris, Trump simply said, "I'm hearing from a lot of people both ways." Many scientific organizations have released statements or reports affirming that anthropogenic climate change is real and that it could have devastating effects if actions are not taken to limit carbon dioxide emissions. The American Meteorological Society released a statement that read in part: "It is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half century is human-induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO ), chlorofluorocarbons, methane and nitrous oxide." Dan Bodansky, a law professor at Arizona State University and a leading climate change expert, explained that Trump could get the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement two different ways: withdrawing from the Paris Agreement itself or leaving the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The text of Paris Agreement allows for countries to provide a year's notice of its intent to withdraw. But this notice cannot be submitted until three years after the agreement entered into force for that country, which happened in November 2016. "Whether the U.S. decides to pull out or not, under international law and the Paris Agreement, the withdrawal would not be effective until 2020," Bodansky told Yahoo News. Another option, which would get the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement in just one year, would be to leave UNFCCC, which was an agreement brokered under former President George H.W. Bush in the early '90s. Although this would be faster, it would carry even more serious consequences. Bodansky said that leaving the UNFCCC would automatically get the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement as well. "If we pulled out of both then we wouldn't be a party at all. We wouldn't participate in meetings and we'd just be there as an observer," he said. "Both of them would be viewed very negatively by other countries — by allies in Europe and elsewhere — but pulling out of the Framework Convention would be an even more drastic step."

708	CNN	left_bias	2017-10-10	EPA Administrator Pruitt announces withdrawal of Clean Power Plan While speaking in Kentucky at an event with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Pruitt said he will sign the proposed rule repealing Obama's plan Tuesday." When you think about what that rule meant, it was about picking winners and losers. Regulatory power should not be used by any regulatory body to pick winners and losers," he said at the event. "The past administration was using every bit of power and authority to use the EPA to pick winners and losers and how we generate electricity in this country. That's wrong." Under the interpretation proposed in this notice, the CPP exceeds the EPA's statutory authority and would be repealed," the proposal reads. "The EPA welcomes comment on the legal interpretation addressed in this proposed rulemaking." The proposal also says the EPA has yet to determine whether it will create an additional rule on the regulation of greenhouse gases. first reported on the repeal proposal. first reported on the repeal proposal. Bloomberg News first reported on the repeal proposal. The Clean Power Plan requires states to meet specific carbon emission reduction standards based on their individual energy consumption. The plan also includes an incentive program for states to get a head start on meeting standards on early deployment of renewable energy and low-income energy efficiency. Under President Barack Obama, the EPA estimated the Clean Power Plan could prevent 2,700 to 6,600 premature deaths and 140,000 to 150,000 asthma attacks in children. When asked earlier this year on Fox News about the health consequences of doing away with the Clean Power Plan, Pruitt ducked the question and focused on how the plan would cost jobs. He argued the plan was bureaucratic overreach. "As much as we want to see progress made with clean air and clean water, with an understanding that we can also grow jobs, we have to do so within the framework of what Congress has passed," Pruitt said. Former EPA employees have reacted harshly to the planned repeal of the rule. Obama's EPA administrator, Gina McCarthy, called the proposal "just plain backwards." "A proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan without any time line or even a commitment to propose a rule to reduce carbon pollution, isn't a step forward, it's a wholesale retreat from EPA's legal, scientific and moral obligation to address the threats of climate change," McCarthy said in a statement Friday. Environmental advocacy groups quickly blasted Pruitt's decision, with many vowing to fight the measure in court. "Now the public has an opportunity to weigh in, as EPA is required to accept public comment on the proposed repeal and a discussion paper on a replacement," Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement Monday. "In addition, NRDC expects to take EPA to court when the Clean Power Plan repeal is made final." When reports of the EPA's planned move began to be reported over the weekend, Environmental Defense Fund President Fred Krupp said repealing the plan without replacing it with any protections from "climate-destabilizing pollution" would fail to protect Americans from harmful pollution designated under the Clean Air Act. And Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, said Trump and Pruitt are launching "one of the most egregious attacks" on public health and climate safety. "No matter who is in the White House, the EPA is legally required to limit dangerous carbon pollution, and the Clean Power Plan is an achievable, affordable way to do that," Brune said in a Monday news release. "It is a key element in continuing the progress moving toward clean energy and retiring coal." Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, whose philanthropy said it would donate $15 million toward supporting operations of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change after the Trump administration announced intentions to withdraw from the Paris climate accord, tweeted his criticism of the repeal proposal Monday. "The EPA can repeal the Clean Power Plan but not the laws of economics," Bloomberg tweeted. "This won't revive coal or stop the US from reaching our Paris goal."	False	False	True	False	False

843	Daily Mail	questionable_source	2017-09-12	WH won't say if climate change responsible for hurricanes Trump administration officials are keeping their lips sealed on whether they believe there are connections between the two Category 4 hurricanes that came barreling at the United States in recent weeks – Harvey and Irma – and climate change. When Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked about a link Monday she touted the country's environmental record and moved on. When Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert was asked, as he preceded Huckabee Sanders in the briefing, he wouldn't talk about climate change's cause.'I will tell you that we continue to take seriously the climate change,' he said. 'Not the cause of it, but the things that we observe.''Causality is something outside my ability to analyze right now,' Bossert also added. When President Trump was asked about it Sunday, returning home to the White House from Camp David, he simply ignored the reporter's query and walked inside. Climate scientists largely agree that the oceans are heating up, leading to larger, scarier hurricanes. At Monday's briefing, Huckabee Sanders dismissed a climate change question, noting that Trump had addressed the issue previously of whether he thought it was man-made. In the past Trump has suggested climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese to choke American industry. In June he pulled the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Huckabee Sanders was also asked if Trump was re-thinking that decision now.'I'm not sure, specifically, on the Paris climate deal, but as he said at the time the goal is to always do the very best when taking care of the environment and taking proper steps,' Huckabee Sanders replied.'The United States is one of the best in the world at doing this, we want to continue to do that, but right now the administration is focused on the recovery and the relief efforts and as Tom [Bossert] said a few minutes ago we'll look at that analysis once we get through the coming days and focus on the recovery and relief and saving-life effort,' Huckabee Sanders added. Bossert had suggested that the hurricanes be studied, though also pointed out the cyclical nature of the seasons.'And I think the scientists for the forecast on this particular one, they were dead on that this would be a stronger, more powerful hurricane season with slightly more than average large storms making landfall in the United States,' he said.'So we'll have to do a larger trend analysis at a later date,' Bossert added. The Environmental Protection Agency's Scott Pruitt went one step further when asked about climate change Friday, suggesting that it wasn't appropriate.'To have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm versus helping people, or actually facing the effect of the storm, is misplaced,' Pruitt said. Of course the scientific community, as the New York Times put it, believes that 'drawing links between warming global temperatures and the ferocity of hurricanes is about as controversial as talking about geology after an earthquake.'But in politics it's become a heated issue that speaks to the current red-versus-blue divide. And while it's primarily Republicans who won't touch the global warming third rail, that doesn't always hold true. On Sunday, Sen. John McCain, R-Fla., who has preached bipartisanship in recent months on the heels of his cancer diagnosis, told CNN's Jake Tapper that he didn't know why his Republican colleagues were denying climate change, adding that it was 'time to sit down.''We have to understand that the climate may be changing and we can take common sense measures which will not harm the American people,' McCain argued.

53	foxnews	right_bias	2019-02-05	'Green New Deal' details emerge, as Ocasio-Cortez preps big reveal of WW2-level mobilization New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Monday unveiled new details on the so-called "Green New Deal" she plans to introduce in a matter of days, as she worked behind-the-scenes to rally congressional support for the proposal that could cost as much as $7 trillion. Ocasio-Cortez, who is set to unveil the plan with Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey, told her fellow representatives in a letter that the Green New Deal calls for a "national, social, industrial and economic mobilization at a scale not seen since World War II." Next week, we plan to release a resolution that outlines the scope and scale of the Green New Deal," Ocasio-Cortez said in the letter, adding that the country's near-total economic transformation should take approximately ten years. To raise awareness for the measure, Markey announced Monday he had invited Varshini Prakash, the co-founder of the Sunrise Movement environmentalist group, to be his guest at President Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday night. (Several other Democrats announced guests apparently intended to highlight their opposition to various Trump administration policies, while Trump himself extended invites to the family of a couple allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrant and a child bullied at school for having the last name "Trump.")The Green New Deal proposal would lead to national net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, according to Ocasio-Cortez's letter, "through a fair and just transition for all communities and workers," while also generating millions of "good, high-wage jobs." Details of the letter were first published by Bloomberg. ANALYSIS: GREEN NEW DEAL IS MOST RADICAL LEGISLATION IN DECADESThrough it all, the Green New Deal would additionally "promote justice and equity by preventing current and repairing historic oppression to frontline and vulnerable communities," according to Ocasio-Cortez. On Twitter Monday, Ocasio-Cortez reposted a claim from one of her advisers, Robert Hockett, arguing that "in this case, size matters" and that "the problems the Green New Deal addresses require solutions where bigger is better, imperative, and paraodixcally, more affordable." Hockett is a lawyer and law professor, and is not an expert in environmental policy. Several analysts, meanwhile, have cautioned that the liberal firebrand is in over her head, even though the as-yet vague and uncertain details about the Green New Deal render a precise calculation impossible at the moment. Physicist Christopher Clack told The Hill that the cost would easily be into the trillions." t's a daunting task, and I'm not sure that the authors of the Green New Deal fully comprehend how much they'll need," Clack said. Institute for Energy Research president Tom Pyle was more blunt: "One hundred percent renewable energy defies the laws of physics. It would be impossible to achieve." And Paul Bledsoe, a strategic adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute, said progressives were overcompensating. "I understand the value of aspirational goals," Bledsoe said. "My personal view is, that undermines the credibility of the effort." Nevertheless, approximately 70 Democratic lawmakers have so far tentatively endorsed a Green New Deal plan, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris. House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has vowed to address climate change, has not publicly signed onto the plan, even though scores of progressive activists -- joined by Ocasio-Cortez -- staged a sit-in at her House office late last year, demanding action on the climate. While there is no legislative text yet available for the Markey/Ocasio-Cortez proposal, a draft circulated by Ocasio-Cortez last week called for a committee to be formed to create a plan, and lays out a framework that includes eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture, while "dramatically" expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources. To cover what would presumably be a gargantuan cost, it envisions financing by "the federal government, using a combination of the Federal Reserve, a new public bank or system of regional and specialized public banks, public venture funds and such other vehicles or structures that the select committee deems appropriate, in order to ensure that interest and other investment returns generated from public investments made in connection with the plan will be returned to the treasury, reduce taxpayer burden and allow for more investment." As it stands, any such proposal would be almost certainly dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled Senate, and also possibly the House -- where it is not clear if a majority of Democrats would back a plan. Even if Congress managed to pass a version of the Green New Deal, the White House could veto the legislation, and a two-thirds majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate would be needed to override the veto. The Trump administration has made clear it would not accept Ocasio-Cortez's proposals. In January, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders derided Ocasio-Cortez's recent claim that the world will end in 12 years due to climate change, and suggested the Trump administration has little need for the progressive firebrand's thoughts in general. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"I don't think we're going to listen to [Ocasio-Cortez] on much of anything -- particularly not on matters we're gonna leave in the hands of a much, much higher authority -- and certainly, not listen to the freshman congresswoman on when the world may end," Sanders told Fox News' "Hannity." Speaking at an event commemorating Martin Luther King Day that month, Ocasio-Cortez asserted that climate change constituted "our World War II" and added: "Millennials and people, you know, Gen Z and all these folks that will come after us are looking up and we're like: 'The world is gonna end in 12 years if we don't address climate change and your biggest issue is, how are we gonna pay for it?'"

661	CNN	left_bias	2017-04-20	EPA head visits community famous for lead contamination The people who live there are at risk of lead contamination at every turn. It's in their drinking water and it's in their soil. More than one thousand people were forced to evacuate, according to Debbie Chizewer at Northwestern Law School, who has worked very closely with the affected residents. A local school was shut down and a public housing complex was also evacuated after soil tests showed lead and arsenic contamination levels 228 times the amount the Environmental Protection Agency considers potentially hazardous to children. It was the first superfund site EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has visited -- making a trip there Wednesday -- and the agency said he was the first administrator to visit this particular site. Pruitt visited "to discuss cleanup and hear directly from East Chicago residents affected by contamination in their community," the agency said in a press release. At a press conference, local officials praised Pruitt for visiting the site. The community is what's a called a legacy contamination site. It was listed on the "National Priorities List" of the worst contaminated hazardous waste sites in the country in 2009. The site includes part of the former USS Lead facility along with nearby commercial, municipal and residential areas, including the West Calumet public housing complex. Barbara Bolling-Williams, state president of the Indiana branch of the NAACP, said she is cautiously optimistic following Pruitt's visit, but added that his visit comes with the threat of "a skinnier EPA budget, fewer regulations -- and rumors Chicago's regional EPA office could be shut down looms in the background." The Trump administration's proposed budget calls for a 31% cut to the budget, including cuts to the agency's environmental justice program. The program is intended to support poor, often minority communities with severe environmental challenges. One week ago, the local chapter of the NAACP said it invited Pruitt to a roundtable discussion on environmental justice, which happened Wednesday morning. In attendance were residents, NAACP national President Cornell Williams Brooks and community members. Pruitt skipped that event, and instead invited a group to a meeting of his own at a local school that was shut down as a result of the lead contamination in the community. Bolling-Williams, who was invited to Pruitt's meeting, said: "Pruitt listened to all of our concerns but he did not offer any solutions." She said her organization wants to see the EPA do more to protect the East Chicago community. The NAACP presented Pruitt with a list of demands, including a call for an executive order that would include a greater commitment to communities like East Chicago. "We need them to commit to adjusting cleanup plan for the site. Instead of digging up two feet of contaminated soil for disposal, digging up eight feet. We want that soil to be disposed of properly so as not to cause further contamination, we want continued testing of the soil and ground water in this area and a commitment to ensure the residents exposed to the lead get the physical and mental health care they need for the rest of their life. That includes financial help to make sure that happens. " EPA spokesman J.P. Freire told CNN in an email: "Forget about the politics. Administrator Pruitt was working for environmental justice by meeting with the real residents affected by lead contamination and by committing to get results." In its press release, the agency laid out the accomplishments of its cleanup effort under Pruitt: East Chicago is receiving $16.5 million in EPA State Revolving Fund (SRF) funding for drinking-water infrastructure upgrades. EPA, the state and the city are working together to coordinate lead service-line replacement with cleanup work to expedite completion of the work and minimize disruptions. EPA provided 54 homes with filters and bottled water while Superfund work was underway at those properties in Zones 2 and 3. This year, Indiana will distribute filters to all residents in Zones 2 and 3. The Natural Resources Defense Council told CNN that Pruitt has yet to respond to its request for more EPA assistance and oversight in the lead problem in East Chicago's drinking water. Those demands include: Oversight of East Chicago's ongoing attempts to improve its corrosion control treatment; expanded blood-lead level testing of children under age 7; bottled water and home water filtration systems to residents throughout the city and testing the city's drinking water to determine the extent of the contamination. During his visit, Pruitt provided brief comments at a press conference in East Chicago but quickly exited without answering questions from reporters. The Agency's press release quoted Pruitt saying: "I'm focused on getting EPA back to the basics of protecting human health and the environment, and one of my top priorities is delivering real results for the people of East Chicago.' Pruitt went on: "Since I was sworn in as administrator, funding has been secured for drinking water infrastructure upgrades in East Chicago, filters and bottled water have been provided to residents and cleanup of contaminated soil has resumed."

423	thehuffingtonpost	left_bias	2018-10-08	'Sobering' New UN Report Challenges Republican Climate Hawks' Free-Market Dogma Kirsti McCluer / Reuters Golfers play in North Bonneville, Washington, last fall as the Eagle Creek wildfire burns. The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the world must drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions to avoid climate disaster." he only force that I know of on the planet that can deliver innovation as quickly as we need it is the free enterprise system," said former Rep. Bob Inglis (R-S.C.), now the executive director of RepublicEn, a group urging Republicans to support a carbon tax. The report, based on more than 6,000 scientific references, found that world governments have just 12 years to cut planet-warming gases 45 percent at a time when humanity's CO2 footprint is rapidly rising and fossil fuel emissions are hitting an all-time high. By 2050, emissions need to hit net zero. Failing to do so would be cataclysmic. The IPCC pegged the price of damage caused by 1.5 degrees of warming at $54 trillion ― a figure that soars to $69 trillion at 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, of temperature rise. There is near-universal agreement that putting a price on carbon dioxide, likely through a tax, is key to scaling back emissions, in much the same way levies on tobacco and alcohol are meant to offset those products' societal costs. Last year Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Reps. Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.) and David Cicilline (D-R.I.) introduced companion carbon-tax bills in Congress. In July, Reps. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) and Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.) proposed a lower carbon tax, earning plaudits for breaking with the Republican orthodoxy calling the very basics of climate change science into question." t's totally unrealistic," said Jennifer Francis, a research professor at Rutgers University. "We're going to need to make a wide range of course corrections to have a hope of achieving 1.5 and also prepare for larger impacts than we're already experiencing." Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University, cast doubt on the possibility of halting human-caused temperature at the 1 degree Celsius average global increase the planet has already experienced. Though he said a "carbon tax high enough" could "reduce emissions arbitrarily fast," the result would be soaring energy prices "rather than what we want, which is a switch to renewables." Asked during an IPCC press conference on Sunday night if carbon pricing could radically overhaul the global economy in the next decade, two IPCC authors started to laugh. James Skea, a co-chair of an IPCC working group, said it was "one among that portfolio of instruments that can be used" but could not serve as a panacea.A number of insurgent left-wing Democrats running in the 2018 midterms, including star New York City congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are coalescing around a so-called Green New Deal, a loose set of proposals to spend trillions in federal dollars on renewable energy projects, coastal fortifications and home weatherization retrofits. Polling released last month shows swelling support for a federal policy guaranteeing a high-wage job in a green industry to anyone who wants one. Last month California became the biggest state to pass a law requiring 100 percent clean electricity by 2045. In a surprise move, Gov. Jerry Brown (D) also signed an executive order mandating the changes' sweep extend beyond utilities to the entire economy, including vehicles, the nation's largest source of carbon pollution. Curbelo and Fitzpatrick did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Nor did the oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp., which spent decades financing a network of climate change misinformation before announcing its support for a carbon tax, or the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, a corporate consortium that advocates for what it calls "practical solutions" to climate change. But for some conservative climate hawks, the reality of the IPCC report hit home. Jerry Taylor, a former climate denier who in recent years became the poster boy for Republican climate realism, said he sticks by a carbon tax as the best solution but believes keeping warming within 1.5 degrees is unrealistic at this point, regardless of policy."  steep enough global-economy-wide price on carbon could do it, but that's not likely to happen," said Taylor, the president of the libertarian Niskanen Center. "Hence the 1.5 C target is aspirational, not functional." Over lunch at a conference last week, Flint staked out his opposition to the Obama administration's use of executive authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. A former Trump transition team official, he described himself as a "sherpa" for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's confirmation process. Now he says he's "trying to get politicians to catch up with the science." Asked where the line is between what critics said was the previous administration's federal overreach and attempting to stave off the worst of what the IPCC predicted, Flint went quiet for a while.

417	vox	left_bias	2018-10-26	The Supreme Court is about to decide if the children's climate lawsuit can proceed One of the biggest legal battles over climate change is now in limbo pending a decision from the Supreme Court's chief justice, who last week took the odd step of halting the lawsuit to consider a stay. The court is expected to rule Friday on whether the case, which was expected to go to trial Monday, can proceed. The suit, Juliana v. US, also known as the children's climate lawsuit, was first filed in 2015 and now includes 21 plaintiffs between the ages of 11 and 22, including Sophie Kivlehan, 20, the granddaughter of the famed climate scientist James Hansen. The case argues that the US government undertook policies that contributed to climate change, thereby causing irreparable harm to young people and denying them a safe climate. As relief, they want the government to pursue policies to keep warming in check. The trial was supposed to begin at the United States District Court in Oregon on October 29. But last week, the defendant, the US government, asked for a stay of the case, arguing the costs of litigation would put an undue burden on it. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts granted a temporary stay and halted discovery until Wednesday to allow the plaintiffs to respond. The district court then vacated the case pending a decision from the high court. Working over the weekend, the children and their lawyers filed a 103-page brief on Monday, "in hopes of receiving a decision from the Chief Justice before the week's end." Now the case is back at the Supreme Court, and what happens next is unclear, including whether the other justices on the bench will weigh in. Several legal analysts told Vox it is extremely unusual for the Supreme Court to step in to block a legal proceeding in a lower court. Appeals from the District Court in Oregon are almost always handled by the 9th Circuit, which has already declined to block the lawsuit. And one of the only other times Supreme Court has done something like this was also related to climate change. In 2016, the court stayed the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan to limit greenhouse gases from power plants, pending ongoing lawsuits from states suing to block the rule from going into effect. But then the children's lawsuit is an unusual case. The plaintiffs essentially are arguing that a safe climate is a civil right, so the implications for climate change policy are huge. Though the case is in uncharted legal territory, it has survived several legal challenges and motions to dismiss, and lower federal courts have allowed it to proceed. Ann Carlson, a professor of environmental law at the University of California Los Angeles, said that the Supreme Court stepping in on a case like this strongly suggests there's something there that piques the court's interest." t's certainly a signal that the court is uncomfortable with the underlying legal theory of the Juliana case," Carlson said. The federal government, under Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump, has argued the case has no merit and repeatedly sought to have it dismissed. Asked for comment, the Department of Justice pointed to comments made by Jeffrey Wood, a political appointee at the DOJ handling environmental cases, who spoke about the Juliana case at a law conference last week. He said that "the purported constitutional right that they assert simply does not exist" and that the Juliana lawsuit "has no legal basis." In our view, the Oregon lawsuit is an unconstitutional attempt to use a single court to control the entire nation's energy and climate policy," Wood said, adding "the plaintiffs in Oregon are ignoring the fact that clean and responsible production and use of fossil fuels remains vital to the health and well-being of the American people." For climate activists old and young, the courts have become a last resort for pushing governments and businesses to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially with an executive branch that's still denying climate change exists and a gridlocked Congress. There are also several ongoing climate change lawsuits filed by cities, counties, and a state against oil companies, though the pivot points are different. The local governments are citing nuisance statutes and seeking money from oil companies to pay for damages caused by climate change, whereas the children's case is trying to force the government to enact policies to curb greenhouse gas emissions. But the prospects for the children's climate lawsuit to succeed appear dim, first because the courts tend to give wide latitude to the executive branch in these cases, and second because the Supreme Court's newest Justice Brett Kavanaugh is much more skeptical of environmental regulations than his predecessor." his is just the beginning of what we're likely to see from a Court that doesn't have Justice Kennedy on it anymore," Carlson said.

438	vox	left_bias	2018-09-21	Ryan Zinke to the oil and gas industry: "Our government should work for you" Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke let the mask slip this week, turning the subtext of his term in office backing fossil fuels into the headline as he spoke to a friendly audience. On Tuesday, Zinke gave the keynote address at the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association's fall meeting in Lafayette, Louisiana. He told the conference over lunch "our government should work for you," according to organizers:You can debate what Zinke meant by "work for you," but many heard it as a pledge of allegiance to the industry. And according to the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, the industry members in the room were thrilled with the pledge, giving Zinke a standing ovation. (An organizer told me none of the speeches at the event were recorded.)However, environmental activists and some lawmakers were appalled by the statement. And then that evening, Zinke's official Twitter account went into damage control mode, implying the message was meant for a broader audience rather than just the industries he's supposed to regulate. But Zinke has said pretty much the same thing before. In March, he told an energy industry conference: "Interior should not be in the business of being an adversary. We should be in the business of being a partner." For the record, the Interior Department's job is to manage about 75 percent of federal public land, which amounts to about one-fifth of the total area of the United States. This means conservation, preserving culture, and facilitating recreation. It also entails leasing rights to mining, drilling, grazing, and logging. However, it does not mean that the agency needs to advance the fossil fuel industry's interests, certainly not at the expense of the environment. But the Interior Department under Zinke has been pushing much harder to open up public lands to private companies while drastically rolling back its environmental responsibilities." ur mandate is multiple-use of public lands, and multiple-use also includes the development of natural resources as we seek to leverage American energy for American strength," Zinke wrote in the department's 2018-'22 strategic plan. One place we've seen Zinke pick sides is in his response to California's record wildfires. Rather than acknowledging the role of climate change in increasing fire risks, he blamed "environmental terrorist groups" while calling for more private logging on public lands. Zinke's words have been loud, but his actions have been even louder. Under Zinke, we've seen the largest rollback of federal land protections in US history. He also opened nearly all US coastal waters to offshore oil and gas drilling, preparing for the largest lease sale in US history. The National Park Service, which is part of the Interior Department, proposed more than doubling national park entrance fees before settling on increases of $5 to $10. The Bureau of Land Management, also part of the Interior Department, announced this week it was revising its rules on methane emissions from gas drilling on public lands. Interior is also pushing for more roads in wilderness areas, dialing back conservation plans for wildlife, and selling leases for Arctic oil and gas drilling. The agency canceled a study looking into the health impacts of coal mining and dismissed violations committed by coal companies. Taken together, it's pretty clear who Zinke is working for. However, the Trump administration has the odd habit of stumbling over itself. President Donald Trump's trade war is already threatening to undo gains for the fossil fuel industry as China readies tariffs on US energy. Zinke himself tendencies exhibited by former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt that have invited scrutiny from lawmakers. He's opaque with his schedule, obscuring his dealings with the energy industry. He took a $12,000 flight on an oil executive's charter plane. He was involved in a land deal with the chair of Halliburton, which may have violated conflict of interest rules. The Government Accountability Office had to end a probe in June into whether Zinke threatened Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) over her vote on Obamacare because the Interior Department didn't cooperate. He also has his office fly a secretarial flag when he's in the building and minted his own challenge coin. With Pruitt no longer sucking the oxygen out of the room, congressional Democrats are now eyeing Zinke and have promised more investigations of his conduct should they take control of the House in the fall." inke is one the most ethically challenged members of the Cabinet and maybe one of the most ethically challenged secretaries of the Interior we've had in living memory," Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA), who could chair the House Oversight Government Operations Subcommittee if Democrats win in November, told Politico this week. "[There's] rich material here to look into his behavior and his fitness for continued service in the office."	False	True	True	False	False
49	foxnews	right_bias	2019-11-04	United States begins process of withdrawing from Paris climate deal The United States submitted a formal notification that it will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Monday, a move that has been widely expected since President Trump announced his intention to do so in 2017. The climate agreement, which went into force Nov. 4, 2016, committed countries that signed the measure to take certain voluntary steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement was not legally enforceable and countries set their own emissions targets. The accord banned countries from announcing their intent to withdraw in its first three years, meaning Monday was the first day the U.S. was allowed to submit its intent to leave the agreement since it went into force in 2016." President Trump made the decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement because of the unfair economic burden imposed on American workers, businesses, and taxpayers by U.S. pledges made under the Agreement," Pompeo said in a statement. "The United States has reduced all types of emissions, even as we grow our economy and ensure our citizens' access to affordable energy." LEONARDO DICAPRIO PRAISES GRETA THUNBERG AS 'A LEADER OF OUR TIME'Trump has previously said that the Paris climate agreement harms the U.S. economy and would hurt American jobs if left to stand." Compliance with the terms of the Paris accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates," Trump said in the Rose Garden in 2017 when he announced plans to remove the U.S. from the accord. "This includes 440,000 fewer manufacturing jobs — not what we need — believe me, this is not what we need — including automobile jobs, and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely. They rely for so much, and we would be giving them so little." Some opponents of the agreement have noted that countries such as Russia and China were not affected as significantly by the accord as the United States and pointed out the unencouraging results of the Kyoto Protocol, raising questions about whether the Paris agreement would reduce global greenhouse gas emissions at all. GRETA THUNBERG TURNS DOWN ENVIRONMENTAL PRIZE, SAYS 'CLIMATE MOVEMENT DOES NOT NEED ANY MORE AWARDS'"Half of the countries that were legally bound to the Kyoto Protocol treaty failed to adhere to their pledges, and the host country of Japan even increased their carbon emissions," Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., said as the Paris climate agreement was being debated in 2016. "Now we find ourselves celebrating an agreement where the world's largest carbon emitter, China, is permitted to increase their emissions until 2025 and to continue bringing a coal-fired power plant online every 10 days. We even turn a blind eye to the fact that China lied about its carbon emissions when it first came to the table with its pledge last year." Others, however, see America backing out of the international pact to limit greenhouse gas emissions as an abdication of global leadership and denial of basic climate science." By withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement to double-down on a coal & fossil fuel energy agenda, Trump has engaged in a unilateral disarmament in the economic arms race that is the transition to clean energy," said Michael Mann, a climate scientist and professor at Penn State University. "The challenge of averting dangerous and irreversible climate change and massive coastal inundation, devastating floods and droughts, is that much more an uphill climb with Trump's pullout from the Paris agreement." CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPIn his statement Monday, however, Pompeo maintained that the United States was on the right track both economically and environmentally." Our results speak for themselves," he wrote. "U.S. emissions of criteria air pollutants that impact human health and the environment declined by 74 percent between 1970 and 2018. U.S. net greenhouse gas emissions dropped 13 percent from 2005-2017, even as our economy grew over 19 percent."	False	False	True	False	False
675	CNN	left_bias	2017-08-02	Al Gore presses on with climate change action in the Trump era "I actually did feel there was a real chance that he might come to his senses and stay in the Paris Agreement," said Gore, who has spent years in pursuit of action on climate change and on Tuesday joined CNN for a town hall, moderated by Anderson Cooper. Gore met with Trump after the 2016 election at the invitation of Ivanka Trump, and he spoke again with the President by phone in early May. But Gore's -- and Ivanka's -- influence clearly was not enough. After some delay, Trump announced in the Rose Garden in June that he intended to pull the United States out of the climate agreement. Gore declined to get into the details of his private conversations with Trump, but said those conversations had left him with "reason to believe" Trump would keep the United States in the agreement, but added that thankfully his worst fears about the withdrawal were not realized."I was worried that other countries might use it as an excuse to pull out themselves," Gore said. "But I was gratified when the next day the entire rest of the world doubled down on the commitment to meet the terms of the Paris Agreement, and then in this country, so many governors and mayors and business leaders said, 'We're still in.'"Gore said that even with Trump's decision, the United States could still manage to meet its own commitments under the Paris Agreement. The town hall featured people across the country who challenged Gore on the issue or asked his thoughts. Mayor James Eskridge of Tangier Island, Virginia, said his home town needed a sea wall to fight erosion, but claimed sea-level rise was not affecting them. "I'm not a scientist, but I'm a keen observer," Eskridge said. "And if sea level rise is occurring, why am I not seeing signs of it?" Earth to warm 2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, studies say Gore said he was aware of the town's situation, and said the town was losing ground to rising seas. Tangier Island gained national prominence after Trump called Eskridge in response to a CNN piece on the town. "Arguments about science aren't necessarily going to be of any comfort to you," Gore said. "Won't necessarily do you any good for me to tell you that the scientists do say the sea level is rising in the Chesapeake Bay, and that you've lost about two-thirds of your island already." Eskridge stood by his claim, saying, "If I see sea-level rise occurring, I'll shout it from the house top. ... I'm just not seeing it." Gore said it was hard to translate what scientists said into something readily observable and believable. "I try every day to figure out ways to do that," he said. Gore warned there could be visible signs of a changing climate, including stronger hurricanes due to rising ocean temperatures. "As the oceans get warmer, these ocean based storms get a lot stronger," he said. "There may not be more hurricanes, but the ones that do come are on average likely to be much stronger." However, Gore insisted that there is still time to act, despite challenges that may lie ahead "in adapting to what we can't avoid." "We still have the ability to slow it down. We have the ability to prevent even worse sea level rise and and even worse catastrophes that are also caused by the climate crisis," Gore said.	True	False	True	False	False
263	rt	questionable_source	2019-03-03	'Pompous twit will get us all killed': AOC tweet-tacked over Green New Deal by ex-Greenpeace founder Greenpeace founder turned climate change skeptic Patrick Moore has reignited his feud with Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, calling her a "pompous little twit" and "garden-variety hypocrite" in a barrage of tweets. Moore helped found the veteran eco-organization in the 1970s, before parting ways with his fellow activists over their left-wing politics and becoming an advocate for nuclear power and lobbyist for the forestry industry. Lately, he has been tussling with New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over the 'Green New Deal,' an ambitious piece of environmental legislation that seeks to dramatically overhaul America's energy sector and economy in a bid to slash carbon output. Moore began picking the Green New Deal apart in February, ridiculing its promise to remove "greenhouse gases from the atmosphere." Technically," he stated, "this would mean removing all H2O vapour and all CO2 which would mean the eradication of all life on Earth." The legislation has been ridiculed from all sides for its proposed abolition of air travel and fossil fuel powered vehicles, as well as its estimated cost of over $50 trillion, over twice the worth of the entire US economy. Ocasio-Cortez has stuck to her guns, however. In a tweet, the Bronx Democrat told skeptics "If you don't like the Green New Deal, then come up with your own ambitious, on-scale proposal... until then, we're in charge." Moore hit back, calling AOC a "pompous little twit" and claiming that "if fossil fuels were banned every tree in the world would be cut down for fuel for cooking and heating. You would bring about mass death." More recently, a New York Post hit-piece lambasted Ocasio-Cortez for using cars to get around while campaigning in New York instead of the subway system. "I also fly and use A/C," Ocasio-Cortez responded. "Living in the world as it is isn't an argument against working towards a better future." The 'world as it is' has the option of taking the subway rather than a taxi," Moore continued. "You're just a garden-variety hypocrite like the others. And you have ZERO expertise at any of the things you pretend to know," he tweeted on Sunday, before calling AOC an "immature bully." Ocasio-Cortez' more mainstream Democrat colleagues have paid lip-service to the Green New Deal, but have been cautious about declaring support for the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi brushed it aside in an interview with Rolling Stone on Thursday, saying it "goes beyond what our charge is." In addition to slashing carbon emissions, the deal calls for widespread wealth redistribution to "counteract systemic injustices," and includes provisions for universal healthcare and taxpayer-funded college tuition. An early overview of the plan, since removed from Ocasio-Cortez' website, promised "economic security for all who are unable or unwilling to work," swore to sideline the private sector in all environmental decision-making, and even vowed to eliminate "farting cows." Republicans argue that the deal is tantamount to full-blown socialism. Its more outlandish provisions have turned it into a punching bag for the GOP, who have sought to paint the Democratic party as the party of socialist totalitarianism ahead of next year's election. After referring to AOC as a raving "lunatic," President Donald Trump said on Saturday that the deal "is the new Democrat platform, and I don't want to talk them out of it...I want them to embrace this plan. I just want to be the Republican who runs against them." Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!	True	False	True	False	True
154	motherjones	left_bias	2019-04-07	Critics of the Green New Deal Rail Against Socialism. We've Seen This Before. This story was originally published by High Country News and is shared here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. The Green New Deal and its proponents aim to tackle the intertwined issues of social and environmental justice in our age of anthropogenic climate change. To accomplish this, they believe they must deploy the federal government, since it is the only institution large enough to coordinate and invest in the necessary policies. But the idea of expanding the role of government has attracted critics, who rail against socialism. To historians, this sounds familiar. This is not the first time socialism, new deals and the environment have intersected. During the catastrophe of the Great Depression of the 1930s, the federal government similarly attempted to ameliorate social and environmental harms by investing in people and places through the New Deal. Then, as now, critics dismissed it as socialism. The "socialist" sobriquet stokes ideological fires but douses historical understanding. One prominent example—Bob Marshall's argument for nationalizing forests during the 1930s—reveals how socialist solutions emerge from specific contexts and problems, not ideological bunkers. In Marshall's case, the dire state of private timberlands in the early 20th century prompted his call for reform. When massive problems develop, cross jurisdictional lines and are associated with market failures, big government responses can seem like the only possible solution. By the early 20th century, hundreds of years of unregulated cutting had ravaged the nation's forests, and Americans faced a crisis that demanded intervention. "Rocks and mountains may be ageless, but men and society are emphatically of the present, and they cannot wait for the slow process of nature to retrieve the catastrophe caused by their unthinking destructiveness," wrote Marshall, a forester for federal agencies throughout his career, a co-founder of The Wilderness Society and the person for whom Montana's Bob Marshall Wilderness Area is named.A massive evaluation of American forestry conducted by the Forest Service in 1932 both shaped and reflected Marshall's views. Appearing the next year, A National Plan for American Forestry, known as the Copeland Report, showed that private forests were failing. (The majority of the nation's timber came from privately held forests, just as it does today.) They burned more often, were not harvested to provide a "continual crop of timber," failed to protect watersheds and offered few recreational opportunities compared to public forests. They caused social problems, too, with lumber workers doing dangerous, transient jobs that resulted in mangled bodies and left hollowed-out towns behind. As Marshall saw it, "The private owner is thus responsible for almost every serious forest problem." So, Marshall argued that American timberlands should be publicly owned. In 1933, four years into the Depression and during the first year of Franklin D. Roosevelt's presidency, Marshall published The People's Forests, his own radical extension of the Copeland Report, which advocated for public ownership of practically all commercial forests in America. He was writing amid an economic catastrophe mirrored in the nation's wild and rural landscapes, where bankrupted farmers, out-of-work loggers and drought-driven refugees were common, not unlike today. Throughout The People's Forests, Marshall showed how private ownership, even when tempered by public regulation, fell short; only full public ownership could keep forests and communities healthy. He united a biological and social vision for forestry, one where human happiness and decent livelihoods might sprout from robust forests. In articulating that vision, he made his socialist case plain: "The fundamental advantage of public ownership of forests over private ownership is that in the former social welfare is substituted for private gain as the major objective of management." Much the way today's Green New Deal seeks to redress both economic and environmental impoverishment, Marshall sought to replace private profit with a broader public spiritedness that aimed for long-term stability, ending cut-and-run practices and ultimately strengthening communities. Marshall's call for reforms reflected an accelerating trend of expanding public lands in the 1930s, when the federal government acquired millions of acres for national parks, national forests and wildlife refuges. Newly passed laws, like the Migratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act (1934) and the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act (1937), helped the government fund refuges, acquire property for conservation and bail out private owners who lived on wrecked lands. Starting around the same time and lasting until the 1950s, Forest Service administrators advocated for public regulation of logging on private land, principally citing concerns about declining timber production and the threat of fire on poorly managed parcels. Though ultimately unsuccessful, those efforts illustrated a push to establish stability amid unsettling crisis, a goal Marshall shared. When capitalism stumbles badly, producing degraded lands and gaping inequalities, socialistic solutions rise in popularity, because their incentives are not tied to profits. Marshall's closing line argues for that perspective: "The time has come when we must discard the unsocial view that our woods are the lumbermen's and substitute the broader ideal that every acre of woodland in the country is rightly a part of the people's forests." Shouting "socialist" as an epithet is a tired strategy, a failure to reckon with specific contexts and problems, whether it's damaged timberlands in the 1930s or rising sea levels today. The People's Forests and the Green New Deal highlight the ways social and environmental harms are woven together, a reminder that real solutions require a mutual untangling, and that — despite American history and politics' suspicion of true socialism — government necessarily holds many of the threads.

168	usatoday	left_center_bias	2019-02-28	Andrew Wheeler, who&apos;s been leading Trump deregulatory charge, confirmed by Senate as EPA chief WASHINGTON – Andrew Wheeler is no longer the acting director of the EPA following the Senate's vote Thursday to make him the official head of the environmental regulatory agency. The Senate narrowly confirmed Wheeler 52-47, largely along party lines with Republicans in support and Democrats against him. While leading President Donald Trump's deregulatory agenda, Wheeler also has emphasized the agency's work to clean up Superfund sites and, for the first time, begin regulating a set of harmful chemicals found in drinking water systems that serve millions of Americans." Mr. Wheeler has proven his ability to advance pragmatic solutions to pressing environmental challenges," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on the Senate floor before the vote. Maine Sen. Susan Collins was the lone Republican to oppose Wheeler's confirmation. While calling Wheeler "certainly qualified for this position," Collins said some of the policies he has proposed as acting administrator "are not in the best interest of our environment and public health, particularly given the threat of climate change to our nation."A former EPA bureaucrat who also served as an influential Capitol Hill staffer and an energy lobbyist, Wheeler had been acting administrator of the agency since July when he replaced Scott Pruitt who left under an ethical cloud. When Trump nominated Wheeler for the official post in November, the president praised him for performing "a fantastic job." Though not as controversial or ethically compromised as Pruitt, Wheeler is opposed by a number of environmental groups who sharply criticize the president's aggressive efforts to undo Obama-era rules they say are designed to protect the environment and address climate change." It's a sad day for public health and the EPA, but mission accomplished for the fossil fuel and chemical industries," Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, said in a statement following the vote. "They have longed for one of their own to call the shots at the agency, and now they finally have their man in Andrew Wheeler." At his confirmation hearing in January, Senate Democrats grilled Wheeler about his agency's proposals to roll back mercury emissions standards, weaken clean water regulations and scrap Obama-era climate change rules. Related: President Trump made the right pick for EPA: Sen. BarrassoShortly after taking over in July, Wheeler's EPA moved ahead with a plan to do away with the Obama-era Clean Power Plan and replace it with a proposed rule to set state guidelines for power-plant emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to a warming planet. And his agency finalized revisions to a 2015 Obama-era rule regulating the disposal of coal ash that gives states and utilities what he called "much needed flexibility" to manage their waste. He also recommended freezing miles-per-gallon standards for cars and light trucks after the 2020 model year and preventing California and other states from setting tougher standards, saying it will improve safety and keep prices lower for consumers." We haven't slowed down and we haven't missed a step," Wheeler told senators in August. "As you can see, we're continuing the president's agenda post-haste."	False	False	True	False	False
210	thenewyorktimes	left_center_bias	2019-09-05	Beto O'Rourke Revives Cap-and-Trade Idea for Carbon Emissions We haven't heard much about a national cap-and-trade system to curb carbon emissions since plans for one died in Congress about a decade ago. But tonight at the CNN climate forum, Beto O'Rourke, the former congressman from Texas, revived the idea as his preferred method of pricing carbon. Under such a system, the government issues a limited number of "allowances" or permits to companies and other entities that emit carbon dioxide, essentially creating a "cap" on emissions. California and states across the Eastern Seaboard have used the system for the past several years to reduce emissions from the power sector. In the $5 trillion climate plan that Mr. O'Rourke released in April, he indicated he would pursue some type of carbon pricing to reach his goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, but didn't specify an approach. In response to a question from Priya Subberwal, a New York University student, Mr. O'Rourke made clear that he prefers cap-and-trade over a straight tax on carbon." e should certainly price carbon. I think the best possible path to do that is through a cap and trade system" he said. "It's the best way to send a pricing signal." The revenue from a cap-and-trade program, he said, would be reinvested in helping communities move toward clean energy. Mr. O'Rourke promised to — surprise, surprise — re-enter the Paris agreement on "Day 1." He also pledged to "lead the world in going well beyond the Paris climate agreement," prevent new oil and gas leases on federal lands and bring back Obama-era climate regulations like fuel economy standards and restrictions on coal-fired power plants. The former Texas congressman was also one of the few candidates who explicitly tied Hurricane Dorian to newly proposed policies. He called for extending temporary protected status "to anyone who wants to seek shelter here" from the Bahamas, which has been overwhelmed by the hurricane. Asylum laws, Mr. O'Rourke said, should "include those who have been impacted by climate change. It's the right thing to do." Mr. O'Rourke was less clear about whether he believes people in his home state of Texas should be prevented from living in vulnerable flood areas. He said the government should help people move but avoided answering a question from the moderator, Don Lemon, about whether some areas were simply too risky for human habitation. One area where the Texan came down strong: No limits on the meat industry, despite calls from the United Nations for people to change their diet to avoid more damage to global land use."  reject any notion that we have to radically or fundamentally change how we eat or what we eat, I think we just have to be more responsible in the way that we do it, and the best way to do that is to allow the market to respond by setting a price on carbon," he said.

Credit: Matt AmesburyAntarctica is a cold, white continent at the bottom of the world. Or so it has been for thousands of years. New evidence points to a sharp increase in biological activity in recent decades across the Antarctic Peninsula, resulting in large swaths of newfound greenery. Published in the journal Current Biology, a new study found major increases in Antarctic moss growth over the past 50 years, which the team of researchers attributes to temperature rises in the region. &#8220;It's another clear sign that the biology of the planet is changing as a result of warming temperatures,&#8221; said Professor Dan Charman of the University of Exeter, who led the research project. &#8220;What surprised us was just how rapid the changes have been and the fact that they are very unusual when compared with growth rates in the late 19th and early 20th century.&#8221;Charman said their evidence shows just how fast Antarctic land surface can change along with climactic changes. The Antarctic Peninsula is among the most rapidly warming areas in the world, with temperatures having increased by almost three degrees Celsius over the last 50 years. In March, a research base near the northern tip of the Antarctic peninsula set a heat record of 17.5 degrees Celsius (63.5° Fahrenheit). Currently, plant life only exists on about 0.3% of Antarctica. Charman said that, while as the Arctic warms a variety of plant life and soil organisms can migrate north, in Antarctica there are no nearby land areas for species to colonize from. But while no new natural plant life is anticipated, existing plant life such as Antarctic hairgrass and Antarctic pearlwort could occupy new ice-free ground as glaciers retreat. Dr. Matt Amesbury, also of the University of Exeter, said there were two main findings to take from their new study, scale and temperature sensitivity:Before now, studies have been from single sites but using a transect of sites, we've been able to show that this significant response to climate change is pervasive across the whole of the Antarctic Peninsula. The second important point is our finding which suggests that moss growth has been highly sensitive to temperature change since the 1950s—under future warming scenarios, this means we are likely to see a greening of the Antarctic Peninsula, both in terms of further increases in growth rates and also expansion of mosses and other plant life.  A Green Island moss bank with icebergs. Credit: Matt AmesburyWhile weather records only began in the 1950s in Antarctica, moss cores can provide a much older picture of how climate change has influenced biology in this frigid part of the world. Going forward, the researchers, who received funding from the Natural Environment Research Council, plan to examine core records dating back thousands of years to see how climate change affected the ecosystem before human activity was part of the picture. In March, James McClintock, a marine biologist with the University of Alabama at Birmingham and author of Lost Antarctica: Adventures In A Disappearing Land, told NPR that in Antarctica it&#8217;s possible to really see the impacts of climate change with your own eyes.&#8220;You know, we&#8217;re seeing changes in whole ecologies, whole communities down here that probably wouldn&#8217;t be unusual over millennia,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But here, they&#8217;re happening over a few decades. I really believe this is sort of the bellwether, if you will, of climate change environments on our planet. And we need to take heed of that. We&#8217;re seeing changes at home. They&#8217;re much more dramatic here, and they&#8217;re going to get more dramatic where we live as well.&#8221;	False	False	False	False	False
136	politicususa	left_bias	2019-04-13	Trump's Environmental Protection Agency chief says climate is not a top priority (Reuters) – The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will unveil a proposal to speed state-level permitting decisions for energy infrastructure projects soon, the agency's chief told Reuters on Thursday, blasting states that have blocked coal terminals and gas pipelines on environmental grounds. President Donald Trump is seeking to boost domestic fossil fuels production over the objections of Democrats and environmentalists concerned about pollution and climate change. On Wednesday he issued a pair of executive orders targeting the power of states to delay energy projects." e started working on it in advance, so we hope to have something out soon," EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in an interview. He was unable to provide a precise timeline. Based on Trump's orders, Wheeler's EPA has been tasked with clarifying a section of the U.S. Clean Water Act that has allowed states like New York and Washington to delay projects in recent years. New York has used the section to delay pipelines that would bring natural gas to New England, for example, and Washington state has stopped coal export terminals that would open the Asian market for struggling coal companies in Wyoming and other landlocked western states." hey are trying to make international environmental policy," Wheeler said of Washington state, whose governor, Democrat Jay Inslee, is running for president on a climate change-focused platform. "They're trying to dictate to the world how much coal is used." Wheeler said New York, which amid strong public pressure denied a clean water act permit for construction of a natural gas pipeline to New England, is forcing that region "to use Russian-produced natural gas." We are importing Russian natural gas which is not produced in an environmentally conscious manner. If the states that are blocking the pipelines were truly concerned about the environment, they would look to where the natural gas would be coming from… I think it's very short-sighted," he said. Wheeler said the EPA would not prevent a state from vetoing a project, but would clarify the parameters they should be able to consider, and the length of time they have to do so. He also said that California is playing politics in its fight with the EPA to preserve its more stringent vehicle emission standards as the national standard. Wheeler said he believes climate change is a problem, but that it had been overblown by former President Barack Obama's administration – at the expense of other bigger issues like water quality." es, climate is an issue and we are working to address it, but I think water is a bigger issue," he said. Wheeler dismissed the findings of a report released earlier this week by EPA scientists in the journal Nature Climate Change that detailed the scale and urgency of climate change. He said while he encouraged EPA scientists to carry out and publish research, he stressed the recent paper "did not reflect EPA policy." Environmental groups say the EPA's replacement of an Obama-era rule limiting carbon emissions from power plants would likely lead to increased emissions by allowing older, more polluting coal plants to operate longer. Asked whether the replacement – the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which gives states responsibility for regulating emissions – is stringent enough, Wheeler said it adheres to the parameters of federal law."  think what is effective regulation is one that follows the law and one that will be held up in court," he said. Several Democrats challenging Trump in the 2020 election have made climate change a top-tier issue, embracing aggressive policy platforms like the Green New Deal calling for an end of fossil fuels use. Asked whether he was concerned that the EPA may be out of synch with polls showing an overwhelming number of young people believe climate change should be a priority issue, Wheeler was dismissive."  do fear that because so many people only talked about climate change. You're right, there could very well be a new generation coming up saying that's the only environmental issue – and it's not," he said.	False	False	True	False	False
525	npr	left_center_bias	2018-02-07	If We Bring The Good Life To All, Will We Destroy The Planet? If We Bring The Good Life To All, Will We Destroy The Planet?Our blog often features stories about efforts to improve life for this planet's 7 billion inhabitants: How to make sure everyone has access to clean water and power, medical care to stay healthy, enough income to feed their kids, education for the children so they can fulfill their potential. But a new study in the Journal Nature Sustainability poses a question not often considered: If we were to succeed in providing all this, what would be the cost to the environment?In other words, can our planet actually sustain the good life for all?As we improve the human condition – building sanitation facilities and expanding farming to provide more food, for example – we necessarily damage the environment. We cut down trees, we put fertilizers in the soil that kill off aquatic life, we pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. So to figure out if we can meet everyone's basic needs without destroying the planet, we need to know: For each bit of progress on the human front, how much harm is done on the environmental side?To find out, Daniel O'Neill — an economist at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom — and several collaborators came up with 11 indicators that a country has met the needs of its citizens. They range from boosting life expectancy above age 65 to ensuring that at least 95 percent of its adult population has graduated from high school, has access to sanitation and earns more than the extreme poverty line of $1.90 a day. Then they looked at seven key ways in which humans damage the environment. For each of these, scientists have calculated what degree of damage would put the planet at risk. In the case of carbon emissions, for instance, the threshold is the total amount that humanity can emit before we will cause the planet to warm enough to trigger catastrophic weather changes. From that, "we can calculate a carbon budget for the rest of the century," notes O'Neill. And then dividing that by the number of people on the planet, "we can say, 'okay this is the carbon budget per person.' "Then they analyzed the data on 150 countries to determine how they scored on both the environmental and the social fronts. The hope was to find at least a few examples of countries that were simultaneously delivering the good life to their citizens while staying within their per capita boundaries for environmental damage — in other words, using natural resources at a rate that would be sustainable even if every person on the planet matched it. Unfortunately, "we really didn't find that," says O'Neill. Instead, says O'Neill, "generally the countries that do well on the social indicators do so by consuming resources at a level that could not be extended to all people on the planet." These include Germany, the Netherlands and Austria. "And the countries that do well on the environmental indicators — in other words, that are consuming resources at a sustainable level — don't do well on the social indicators." Examples include Malawi, Yemen and the Philippines. There are also five countries that do damage above all seven of the environmental boundaries even as they fail to achieve all 11 social indicators. This includes the United States — which misses the mark when it comes to income equality and employment. China is arguably in even worse shape. It exceeds its per capita limits on five of the seven environmental thresholds yet only delivers on three of the social measures. Only one country comes even close to delivering the good life in a sustainable way: Vietnam succeeds on six of social indicators — including a life expectancy above 65 years and providing sufficient nutrition — while staying within its limit on every environmental threshold except carbon emissions. What does this all mean for humanity?"It's a worrying finding," says O'Neill. But he cautions against concluding that there's simply no way for everyone to enjoy a decent life without destroying the planet. After all, these findings are based on how we are doing things now, he says." We certainly hope it's possible to do things better — to achieve a high level of human well-being at a much lower level of resource use." And he adds that this study actually points to one way to do that. Specifically, O'Neill and his fellow researchers ran statistical tests to determine for each environmental measure how much damage it takes to produce a corresponding improvement on each of the social well-being indicators." And what we find is that it follows a curve of diminishing returns — as you use more resources you get less social bang for your buck," says O'Neill. "So there's a turning point after which additional resource use contributes very little to social performance." Wealthy industrialized nations such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada have now reached that point, says O'Neill. "As we increase our resource use we get almost no increase in human well-being from that." And this means the strategy of growing the economy — basically trying to create new wealth — to boost the well-being of its underprivileged citizens is ineffective. A much better approach, argues O'Neill, would be to focus on redistributing the wealth we already have more equitably. And if high-income countries were to adapt such a philosophy, says O'Neill, they could reduce their use of resources. And that, he says would "free up the ecological space" for poor nations – for whom using resources still does make a big impact in improving people's lives.	True	False	False	False	False
716	CNN	left_bias	2017-09-14	Trump dismisses climate change question by contradicting himself on hurricanes Trump, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday after touring damage from Hurricane Irma on Florida's west coast, said "we've had bigger storms than this" when asked about climate change." If you go back into the 1930s and the 1940s, and you take a look, we've had storms over the years that have been bigger than this," Trump said. "If you go back into the teens, you'll see storms that were as big or bigger. So we did have two horrific storms, epic storms, but if you go back into the '30s and '40s, and you go back into the teens, you'll see storms that were very similar and even bigger, OK?"In response to this story, a White House aide pointed CNN to a recent NOAA report that found that it is "premature to conclude that human activities ... have already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane or global tropical cyclone activity." That same report, however, found that human activity "may have already caused changes" and that global warming "will likely cause tropical cyclones globally to be more intense on average" and "lead to an increase in the occurrence of very intense tropical cyclone(s)." Trump campaigned on a platform that rejected much of the scientific community's findings on climate change, arguing that the Obama administration used climate science too often to restrict business growth. Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate accords earlier this year and had previously had called climate change a "hoax" perpetrated by the Chinese. Trump's comments Thursday go against the hyperbolic language he used in the lead-up and aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma. "Hurricane Irma is of epic proportion, perhaps bigger than we have ever seen," Trump tweeted as Irma moved closer to Florida. Earlier this month he tweeted , "Hurricane looks like largest ever recorded in the Atlantic!" And on Thursday in Florida, before his comments aboard Air Force One about climate change, Trump said the people of Florida experienced something "the likes of which we can say really say nobody's ever seen before." "They've never seen a category like this come in because it came in really at a five," he said. Top Trump administration officials have repeatedly dodged questions about how climate change affected the damage done by hurricanes Harvey and Irma, saying the issue should be discussed at a later date. said last week it was "insensitive" to address global warming at this time. said last week it was "insensitive" to address global warming at this time. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said last week it was "insensitive" to address global warming at this time. Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, told CNN that climate change is a "longer discussion on another day" and a "big topic for the media." And both FEMA administrator Brock Long and acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke avoided explicitly answering when asked Tuesday whether the government needs to be more focused on climate change because of the storms. Trump's visit to tour hurricane damage on Thursday was his second trip in as many weeks. Trump toured the Houston area earlier this month after Hurricane Harvey brought massive flooding to the city.

651	National Review	right_bias	2017-09-02	Vox Ruins Funerals in a Quest for Environmental Justice What is the goal of a funeral? Is it to pay tribute to a life lost? To commit the soul of the decedent to his final reward? Or an opportunity to extol your passion for environmental justice?A recent Vox piece by Dean Peterson states with dogged solemnity that "modern burials are awful for the environment," and has an accompanying video whose combination of animation, the veneer of open-mindedness, and a vocally inflective narrator discreetly blurs the line between providing information and outright advocacy. It's yet another instance of the environmentally conscious Left virtue-signaling about the negative effects of nearly everything human beings do: Not even the way we mourn our dead is safe from their parade of moral superiority. The piece and video discuss the environmental effects of American funerals, with their caskets, embalming fluid, and grave sites. The piece claims the average burial costs up to $12,000, though the National Funeral Directors Association's most recent report indicated average costs almost $3,500 less than that. Either way, that's a lot of money, of course, but the point is not to expiate upon the market forces driving prices in the funeral industry. What is most remarkable is the piece's bizarre stance on this debate — Peterson's primary concern appears to be getting rid of Grandma with as small of a carbon footprint as possible, rather than reverence, intergenerational remembrance, or even concern for the grieving. We all hold a hierarchy of values. For most people of good conscience, the value of a human being's life supersedes that of our dog or a backyard plant. We make decisions every day accordingly. We routinely delay temporal pleasure, for example, in the hopes of attaining goals we hold in higher esteem, such as when we diet, exercise, or volunteer. Each individual has values, good and bad, and they often remain in tension with one another. It is, after all, the measure of one's moral fitness to value some things (say, forgiveness) over others (vengeance). What makes radical environmentalism, and its private-jet-flying propagators, so toxic a cultural beast is how high on its adherents' totem pole they are willing to place environmental concerns, often over some of the most elemental human needs and desires. The wish to have additional children, for example, is a cause for deep apprehension among environmentalists, who seem all at once indifferent and tone-deaf to how out of touch such a sentiment is. In this Vox piece, it appears that some environmentalists have shifted focused to the other side of life's journey: death, and more specifically, how we bury our loved ones. For most normal people, funerary concerns are primarily about memorializing the deceased within the reasonable bounds of one's budget. Peterson's video notes that, in this strange race to the environmental bottom, some advocates believe burying Aunt Lisa in a casket is an alarming degradation of the environment — some might even want her tossed straight into the ground. Maybe, he suggests, readers could consider "freezing [their bodies] with liquid nitrogen or having [their] ashes turned into a coral reef." It's an odd calculus at play in the author's mind, where the ultimate barometer of a funeral's efficacy is its environmental impact statement. It's totally legitimate to criticize modern burials; on its face, the piece seems a cogent critique of excesses in the funeral industry. But what is particularly troubling about Vox's article is its larger point — that we as humans must give perpetual deference to some vague conception of "environmentalism" at most any cost. As the oft-repeated refrain goes, is environmentalist hysteria the inevitable fate of a society that ceases to believe in God? When organized religion fades and its would-be adherents are left to search for meaning, does the god of the environment end their search for a moral authority?Pardon the extended biblical analogy, but Vox's piece sounds more than a bit like Judas Iscariot's laments about the funeral rituals performed on Christ. When Mary Magdalene anoints Christ with perfumes and oil as a pre-burial ritual on a night leading up to His execution, a livid Judas berates her gesture, protesting that the money used to buy the perfume could have been spent on "the poor." John's Gospel provides the relevant addendum: "He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief; as keeper of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put into it." That statement not only describes Judas's moral disorder but also reminds the audience that any concern, holy as it may be — poverty reduction, environmental protection, or any other earthly mission — that does not give a preferential deference to God, His creation, and acts of beauty such as that of Mary Magdalene are sure signs of misaligned priorities. This piece from Vox forces us to ask the question: At what point does genuine concern for the environment turn into a power grab so vicious that one would rather soak Grandpa in liquid nitrogen than give him a proper burial?– John Hirschauer is a senior economics student at Fairfield University, a columnist for the Fairfield Mirror, and the host of The Outlet with John Hirschauer radio program.

412	dailykos	left_bias	2018-09-05	DID JIM JORDAN REALLY SELL HIS SOUL TO THE KOCH BROTHERS? Before I address that question, I just stumbled upon an article in the August 1, Washington Post.  There, the Post updated its truth squad totals on Donald Trump: 4,229 false and misleading statements in 558 days.I then reflected upon Anderson Cooper's infamous April 17, 2018 CNN interview of Jim Jordan.  In that interview, a fumbling Jordan firmly insisted, to Cooper's amazement, that he never heard Trump lie.  This is the same Jim Jordan who less than three months later saw no evil and heard no evil in the Ohio State sex scandal that victimized some of Jordan's former wrestling students. I wondered to myself how Jordan's credibility would hold up, when cross-examined in court on this issue, now that these incredible statements are in the public domain. No wonder Trump loves Jordan!  Every word Trump speaks is the "Truth" in Jordan's world. Sure Jordan's a politician, and all politicians lie at some time or another (see Adams, ).  But it's quite another thing when you live your entire Congressional career as one big lie—a lie that causes long-term harm, not only to the folks living in your district but the country as a whole. Nowhere is that lie more obvious than in Jim Jordan's approach to global warming and general environmental issues.  And here's why Jordan will live on in villainy.   In July 2008, after being in Congress for a year and a half, Jim Jordan was the first member of Congress to sign the "No Climate Tax Pledge."  Yes, the first to sign; his initial salvo in an unrelenting fight he wages against our planet. The pledge or vow is the product of Americans for Prosperity, the conservative political advocacy group, funded by David and Charles Koch.  This is the outfit that went to war with the Obama Administration initiatives to combat global warming. The promise itself is significant for a couple of reasons: 1) it opposes any legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in government revenue; 2) it drives the final nail in the coffin of environmental bipartisanship, which had been the norm for decades. Let's take a closer look at this.   First, 71% of Americans now think that most scientists believe global warming is occurring; 68% of Americans believe global warming is caused by human activities. (March 14, 2017, Gallup poll).  Record percentages of Americans are now concerned about global warming.  I would predict the same percentages of belief would apply to Jordan's Ohio 4th Congressional District, plus or minus a few points. But Jordan wanted to be the first congressman in the USA to sell out the voters of a congressional district—never mind it had to be his own.  He couldn't wait to curry favor with the Koch boys and sign on the dotted line. What he's really saying is: "Regardless how bad it gets, how severe the droughts, how out of control the forest fires, how strong the tornadoes and hurricanes, how hot the summers, how cold the winters, how deep the floods, how devastating the blizzards, how much the ice caps melt, how high the oceans rise, I will not vote to tax, tariff, or otherwise increase revenues to cap the use of fossil fuels, unless that money is cut (or borrowed) from somewhere else in the budget."  And in Jordan's case, that would be Social Security, Medicare, education, health care and the like: Programs that benefit folks in his district. So from that July day in 2008, Jordan waged his own war on the environment: Voting to bar greenhouse gasses from Clean Air Act rules; voting against enforcing limits on carbon dioxide global warming pollution, against tax incentives for renewable electricity and energy conservation, against curtailing subsidies for oil and gas company exploration, but voting in favor of opening the Outer Continental Shelf to oil drilling. The League of Conservation Voters, National Environmental Scorecard, awarded Jordan a perfect 0% score for his 2017 record, and a lifetime score of 4% for his work. The saddest part of this story, however, is the depth we've descended into the abyss of partisanship on environmental issues.  These were matters that we have historically agreed on, if for no other reason than the sake of our children and grandchildren's future. For example, in 1969, Congress passed the landmark National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  This revolutionary piece of legislation unanimously passed the Senate; the vote in the House was 372 Years, with only 15 Nays.  Nixon signed it into law on New Year's Day, 1970. Now, thanks to guys like Jordan, NEPA would not even be brought to the floor for a vote, if it were introduced in today's Congress. In contrast, Janet Garrett, by philosophy an environmentalist, will push for and support an agenda that will guarantee clean water, clean air, and the reduction of greenhouse gasses.  Garrett knows the value of Environmental Protection; on those who knowingly violate our statutes, Janet will push for criminal enforcement.  Garrett will defend our National Park system and public lands, as she understands the need to preserve the earth for her children and grandchildren.  To Janet, this is a moral issue. Please support Janet Garrett in her efforts to replace Jordan in Congress.	True	True	True	True	False

That amounts to an 83 percent increase over the same period in 2018 and the highest number since the agency started recording fires in 2013, meaning it is likely the highest number of fires to date. The sudden spike has prompted renewed concern that the destruction of the Amazon basin is the result of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro's environmental policies that don't give much thought to the environment at all. The smoke from the fires has been so bad that when carried by the wind it caused an hourlong blackout in nearby São Paulo. The right-wing populist Bolsonaro, who has shown disdain for protecting the Amazon—home to 3 million species of plants and animals and 1 million or so people—came to power in January. The Bolsonaro regime has reversed previous governments' efforts to enforce environmental regulations and protect what is the largest rainforest in the world. "Over the past decade, previous governments had managed to reduce deforestation with action by federal agencies and a system of fines. But Mr Bolsonaro and his ministers have criticised the penalties and overseen a fall in confiscations of timber and convictions for environmental crimes," the BBC reports. "Last month, the far-right president accused Inpe's director of lying about the scale of deforestation in the Amazon and trying to undermine the government. It came after Inpe published data showing an 88 percent increase in deforestation there in June compared to the same month a year ago." Conversely, NASA has reported overall fire activity in the Amazon basin has been slightly below average." ince Thursday, INPE said satellite images spotted 9,507 new forest fires in the country, mostly in the Amazon basin, home to the world's largest tropical forest seen as vital to countering global warming," Reuters reports. "Wildfires have increased in Mato Grosso and Para, two states where Brazil's agricultural frontier has pushed into the Amazon basin and spurred deforestation. Wildfires are common in the dry season, but are also deliberately set by farmers illegally deforesting land for cattle ranching." Bolsonaro dismissed alarm over the latest data, saying it was simply the season that farmers use open fires to clear farmland. "I used to be called Captain Chainsaw. Now I am Nero, setting the Amazon aflame," he said.	False	False	True	False	False
