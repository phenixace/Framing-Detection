US President Donald Trump has promised to erect a wall along the US Mexico border to curb illegal immigration however scientists have warned that it could have devastating implications for local wildlife. The US Mexico border spans more than 2000 miles 3200 km and crosses some of the most biologically rich areas on the continent. Analysis of the animals that reside in the region reveals the controversial wall could threaten the movement of 1500 animal and plant species that reside in the area. The report which was co authored by 18 scientists from around the world found that62 of the species threatened nu the wall were already listed as 'critically endangered' 'endangered' or 'vulnerable' and up to 17 per cent risk extirpation from the US. More than 2500 experts from around the world have rallied around the new study championing its importance. One of its authors a leading professor from Stanford condemned the US border wall project branding it a 'crime against biodiversity'. The new paper co authored by Stanford biologist Rodolfo Dirzowarns some species face extinction if their movement is restricted by the border wall planned by President Trump. According to the study the border wall will harm wildlife populations by fragmenting degrading and eliminating existing habitat as well as by blocking migration. ProfessorDirzo a professor of biology at Stanford said 'The bordersis an ecological theatre where evolution has engendered a plethora of plays. 'A multitude of factors climatic conditions topography geological history soil types converge to create an amazing mosaic of ecosystems.' The research looked at 346 different species native to the region around the US Mexico border and predicted how the wall's installation would affect each of them. The wall would bisect the habitats of a combined1506 native terrestrial and freshwater species 1077 animal and 429 plant the researchers said. The study concluded that animals including the Mexican Gray Wolf Sonoran pronghorn antelope jaguar and bighorn sheep would all be directly impacted. Writing in the study entitled 'Nature Divided Scientists United USMexico Border Wall Threatens Biodiversity and Binational Conservation' the authors claim 'A continuous border wall could disconnect more than 34 per cent of US non flying native terrestrialand freshwater animal species from the 50 per cent or more of their range that lies south of the border. 'If cut off by a border wall 17 per cent of the 346 species we analysedincluding jaguar Panthera onca and ocelot Leopardus pardalis would have residual U.S. populationscovering 20000 km2 or less. 'This would elevate their risk of extirpation within the US according to IUCN Red List criteria.' The paperpublished in the journal BioScience predicts that some species will face extinction if their movements are restricted by the wall Donald Trump pledged to build during the presidential campaign in 2016. ProfessorDirzo a professor of biology at Stanford said 'The borderis an ecological theater where evolution has engendered a plethora of plays. 'A multitude of factors climatic conditions topography geological history soil types converge to create an amazing mosaic of ecosystems.' His colleague Emeritus professor of Biology Paul Ehrlich also of Stanford said that a smaller development such as a shopping centre or a new road already has a direct impact on biodiversity. Building something as large as a 2000 mile 3200 km long fence would be tantamount to a 'crime against biodiversity'. Professor Dirzo added 'Cut off like this the bighorn sheep and other animals and plants will become zombie species populations that are demographically and genetically doomed.' To mitigate the effects of the proposed wall the authors make several urgent recommendations to the US Congress and Department of Homeland Security. Some of the recommendations include Following existing environmental laws taking action to mitigate ecological harm and forgoing physical barriers in particularly sensitive areas. The research paper also calls for the government to encourage scientific research in the borderlands to inform and assist environmental evaluation and mitigation efforts. The authors conclude that 'national security can and must be pursued with an approach that preserves our natural heritage.'	False	False	False	True	True
WASHINGTON The Trump administration says it will bypass 37 environmental and other laws to expedite construction of a 15 mile long section of President Donald Trumpsplanned wall along the U.S. Mexico border seemingly removing any doubt about whether the the wall will harm the environment. The waiver announced Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security applies to the construction of several wall prototypes access roads and 14 miles of replacement fencing near San Diego a Homeland Security official told HuffPost. DHS has been granted authority to exempt itself from all legal requirements it determines necessary to construct barriers and roads under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. Between 2005 and 2008 the department invoked that authority five times according to the agency. DHS noted in its Tuesday release that in fiscal year 2016 the U.S. Border Patrol apprehended more than 31000 illegal aliens and confiscated more than 9000 pounds of marijuana and more than 1300 pounds of cocaine in itsSan Diego Sector. It described the sector which includes some 60 miles of the U.S. Mexico border as an area of high illegal entry for which there is an immediate need to improve current infrastructure and construct additional border barriers and roads. Among the lengthy list of laws it will waive are the National Environmental Policy Act a 1969 law requiring federal agencies to complete environmental assessments of their projects the Endangered Species Act the Migratory Bird Conservation Act and the Clean Air Act.It is likely a sign of how the administration which has worked swiftly to roll back a slew of environmental regulations plans to fulfill Trumpspledgefor a great great wall on the nearly 2000 mile southern border. Despite sidestepping these laws DHS is committed to responsible environmental stewardship and will continue to assess potential impacts coordinate with relevant stakeholders and to the extent possible offset or mitigate potential impacts department spokesman Carlos Diaz said in an email to HuffPost. Trump wants to scare people into letting him ignore the law and endanger wildlife and people Brian Segee an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity said in a statement. Trumps wall is a divisive symbol of fear and hatred and it does real harm to the landscape and communities. A study by the center in May found that 93 threatened endangered and candidate speciescould be negatively affected by the proposed border wallincluding jaguars ocelots Mexican spotted owls Mexican gray wolves and Quino checkerspot butterflies. Driven by an anti immigrant agenda the Trump administration is callously putting construction of an environmentally and culturally destructive border wall above water resources for communities on both sides of the border federally protected lands clean air and the lives of hundreds of endangered species all while turning a blind eye to the vital relationships of cross border communities and our longstanding values as a nation she said in a statement. So far very little funding has been secured for the walls estimatedcost of upwards of 70 billion a tab Trump insists Mexico will eventually pay for. DHS identified 20 million to help fund several prototypes. And last month the House of Representatives passed a spending bill that earmarks 1.6 billion to begin construction of the controversial project enough to pay for roughly 74 miles of wall.

Concentrations of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere surged to a record high in 2016 according to the World Meteorological Organization WMO. Last year's increase was 50 higher than the average of the past 10 years. Researchers say a combination of human activities and the El Nio weather phenomenon drove CO2 to a level not seen in 800000 years. This year's greenhouse gas bulletin produced by the WMO is based on measurements taken in 51 countries. Research stations dotted around the globe measure concentrations of warming gases including carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide. The figures published by the WMO are what's left in the atmosphere after significant amounts are absorbed by the Earth's sinks which include the oceans and the biosphere. 2016 saw average concentrations of CO2 hit 403.3 parts per million up from 400ppm in 2015. It is the largest increase we have ever seen in the 30 years we have had this network Dr Oksana Tarasova chief of WMO's global atmosphere watch programme told BBC News. The largest increase was in the previous El Nio in 1997 1998 and it was 2.7ppm and now it is 3.3ppm it is also 50 higher than the average of the last ten years. El Nio impacts the amount of carbon in the atmosphere by causing droughts that limit the uptake of CO2 by plants and trees. Emissions from human sources have slowed down in the last couple of years according to research but according to Dr Tarasova it is the cumulative total in the atmosphere that really matters as CO2 stays aloft and active for centuries. Over the past 70 years says the report the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere is nearly 100 times larger than it was at the end of the last ice age. Rapidly increasing atmospheric levels of CO2 and other gases have the potential according to the study to initiate unpredictable changes in the climate system... leading to severe ecological and economic disruptions. The study notes that since 1990 there has been a 40 increase in total radiative forcing that's the warming effect on our climate of all greenhouse gases. Geological wise it is like an injection of a huge amount of heat said Dr Tarasova. The changes will not take ten thousand years like they used to take before they will happen fast we don't have the knowledge of the system in this state that is a bit worrisome! According to experts the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was three to five million years ago in the mid Pliocene era. The climate then was 2 3C warmer and sea levels were 10 20m higher due to the melting of Greenland and the West Antarctic ice sheets. Other experts in the field of atmospheric research agreed that the WMO findings were a cause for concern. The 3ppm CO2 growth rate in 2015 and 2016 is extreme double the growth rate in the 1990 2000 decade Prof Euan Nisbet from Royal Holloway University of London told BBC News. It is urgent that we follow the Paris agreement and switch rapidly away from fossil fuels there are signs this is beginning to happen but so far the air is not yet recording the change. Another concern in the report is the continuing mysterious rise of methane levels in the atmosphere which were also larger than the average over the past ten years. Prof Nisbet says there is a fear of a vicious cycle where methane drives up temperatures which in turn releases more methane from natural sources. The rapid increase in methane since 2007 especially in 2014 2015 and 2016 is different. This was not expected in the Paris agreement. Methane growth is strongest in the tropics and sub tropics. The carbon isotopes in the methane show that growth is not being driven by fossil fuels. We do not understand why methane is rising. It may be a climate change feedback. It is very worrying. The implications of these new atmospheric measurements for the targets agreed under the Paris climate pact are quite negative say observers. The numbers don't lie. We are still emitting far too much and this needs to be reversed said Erik Solheim head of UN Environment. We have many of the solutions already to address this challenge. What we need now is global political will and a new sense of urgency. The report has been issued just a week ahead of the next instalment of UN climate talks in Bonn. Despite the declaration by President Trump that he intends to take the US out of the deal negotiators meeting in Germany will be aiming to advance and clarify the rulebook of the Paris agreement.

The top lawmakers on the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources were unified in their opposition to the Green New Deal and unreadiness to back taxes on carbon dioxide emissions. Theres no such thing as a new green deal West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin said during a Monday night panel at an international energy conference in Houston. Theres a resolution that has a dream but theres no bill theres no contents at all. Manchin a Democrat appeared alongside Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski a Republican at the event hosted by the consulting firm IHS Markit. Murkowski chairs the Senate energy committee and Manchin is the ranking Democrat. Manchin favors using fossil fuels like coal into the future but wants to fund technology to offset carbon dioxide emissions or sequester them underground. Murkowski said the Green New Deal was distracting from bipartisan efforts to fight global warming. We have to work within the systems we have and make sure we are not destroying our economy at the same time were moving to a lower carbon economy Murkowski said. As it stands now the Green New Deal is a non binding resolution with a series of broad goals for fighting global warming including net zero greenhouse gas emissions retrofitting every building expanding high speed rail universal health care and job guarantees. Many Democrats including 2020 presidential hopefuls back the Green New Deal which was introduced by Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey in early February. RELATED John Kasich Praises The Green New Deal However Senate Democrats are trying to avoid having to vote on the Green New Deal resolution. Republicans on the other hand want to get Democrats on the record in support of a proposal they see as socialism. Manchin and Murkowski also said they are not ready to support a carbon tax despite support from some large oil and gas companies The Washington Examiners Joshua Siegel tweeted. Both lawmakers were responding to a question asked by Axios Amy Harder during the event. Most Republicans oppose a carbon tax though a handful have joined oil and gas majors and Democrats to push carbon tax proposals. The most recent high profile carbon tax effort was led by former Florida GOP Rep. Carlos Curbelo who introduced a bill to use emissions taxes to fund the federal Highway Trust Fund. However Curbelos policy went nowhere in the House and he lost his re election bid in 2018.

World leaders reacted with dismay Thursday to President Trump's announcement that he was pulling out of the Paris climate accord while three prominent European heads of state rejected his suggestion that the deal could be renegotiated. French President Emmanuel Macron German Chancellor Angela Merkel and and Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentilonisaid in a joint statement that they regretted the United States' decision to withdraw from the accord but affirmed our strongest commitment to implement its measures and encouraged all our partners to speed up their action to combat climate change. While Trump said the United States would be willing to rejoin the accord if it could obtain more favorable terms the three European leaders said the agreement cannot be renegotiated since it is a vital instrument for our planet societies and economics. Macron repeated that belief in an English language speech from the Elysee presidential palace unprecedented from a French president in an address at home. He said I do respect this decision but I do think it is an actual mistake both for the U.S. and for our planet. Wherever we live whoever we are we all share the same responsibility make our planet great again Macron added. The European Union's top climate change official Miguel Arias Canente said in a statement that Trump's decision to leave the Paris accord made it a sad day for the global community adding that the bloc deeply regrets the unilateral decision. Canete also predicted that the EU would seek new alliances from the world's largest economies to the most vulnerable island states as well as U.S. businesses and individuals supportive of the accord. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres called the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement a major disappointment and said it was crucial that the United States remains a leader on environmental issues according to his spokesman. Norway's largest pension fund with 53 billion euro 59.5 billion in assets under its management said it would continue to invest in renewable energy despite the American president's decision saying in a statement that Donald Trump is jumping off a train that has already left the station. Chief executive Odd Arild Grefstad cited the growth of renewable energy in U.S. states such as Texas New York and California as signs that the world has started the transition from fossil to a renewable economy. In Mexico former President Vicente Fox criticized Trump's move saying on Twitter He's declaring war on the planet itself. Fox who has clashed with Trump since last year's presidential campaign said the U.S. leader's decision condemns this generation and those to come and would leave a dark legacy just to satisfy your greediness. Bill Ford chairman of the Ford Motor Co. also weighed in saying We believe climate change is real and remain deeply committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our vehicles and our facilities. Before Trump announced his decision Thursday afternoon Chinese Premier Li Keqiang told reporters during a visit to Berlin that fighting global warming was a global consensus and an international responsibility. Without mentioning the U.S. specifically Li said that China in recent years has stayed true to its commitment and pointed out that his was one of the first countries to ratify the 2015 Paris Agreement. While traveling abroad last week Trump was repeatedly pressed to stay in the deal by European leaders and Pope Francis. Withdrawing would leave the United States as one of just three countries outside the agreement. The other two are Syria and Nicaragua. Russia joined the chorus speaking out for the climate accord. Speaking to reporters on Thursday before Trump's decision was announced a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin said Russia thinks highly of the accords and sees no alternative to it. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov added that its implementation will not be as effective without the key signatories. Scientists say Earth is likely to reach more dangerous levels of warming sooner if the U.S. retreats from its pledge because America contributes so much to rising temperatures. Calculations suggest withdrawal could release up to 3 billion additional tons of carbon dioxide a year enough to melt ice sheets faster raise seas higher and trigger more extreme weather.

NEW YORK Reuters Only 200 miles separate Michael Tilden and Miranda Garcia in rain soaked Iowa. But they are worlds apart when it comes to their opinion of the weather. Garcia a 38 year old former journalist and Democrat from Des Moines thinks flooding has been getting worse in the state which just came out of its wettest 12 months on record. Tilden a 44 year old math teacher and Republican from Sioux City thinks otherwise Ive noticed essentially the same weather pattern every single year he said. Their different takes underscore a broader truth about the way Americans perceive extreme weather Democrats are far more likely to believe droughts floods wildfires hurricanes and tropical storms have become more frequent or intense where they live in the last decade according to a ReutersIpsos poll. The divergence shows how years of political squabbling over global warming including disputes over its existence have grown deep roots distorting the way Americans view the world around them. The divide will play into the 2020 election as Democratic hopefuls seek to sell aggressive proposals to reduce or even end fossil fuel consumption by drawing links between climate change and recent floods storms and wildfires. Nearly two thirds of Democrats believe severe thunderstorms and floods have become more frequent compared to 42 and 50 of Republicans respectively according to the poll. About half of Democrats meanwhile think droughts hurricanes and tropical storms are more common in their region versus less than a third of Republicans according to the poll. Similarly nearly seven in 10 Democrats said in the poll that severe weather events such as thunderstorms have become more intense compared to 4 of 10 Republicans. And nearly half of Republicans said there has been no change in the intensity of severe weather over the past decade versus a fifth of Democrats. The ReutersIpsos poll was conducted online in English between June 11 and 14 and gathered responses from 3281 people. It has a credibility interval a measure of precision of 2 percentage points up or down. U.S. government researchers have concluded that tropical cyclone activity rainfall and the frequency of intense single day storms have been on the rise according to data compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency. For example six of the 10 most active years for tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin since 1950 have occurred since the mid 1990s and nine of the top 10 years for extreme one day precipitation events nationwide have occurred since 1990 according to the data. We do expect to see more intense storms said David Easterling a spokesman for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administrations National Centers for Environmental Information. An overwhelming majority of scientists believe human consumption of fossil fuels is driving sweeping changes in the global climate by ramping up the concentration of heat trapping gases in the atmosphere. But it is impossible to draw a direct link between the changes in U.S. weather in the recent past to the larger trend of warming. President Donald Trump has cast doubt on the science of climate change saying he believes that research into its severity causes and effects is not yet settled. Two years ago he announced the United States would withdraw from a global pact to reduce carbon emissions the Paris Climate Agreement a deal Trump said could damage the U.S. economy. Still a majority of Republicans believe the United States should take aggressive action to combat global warming Reuters polling shows. Some Republican lawmakers have offered proposals for market based approaches to fend off climate change such as cap and trade systems that would force companies to cut carbon emissions or buy credits from those that do. Democrats are pushing more aggressive ideas. Nearly all of the partys presidential hopefuls who seek to unseat Trump in next years election have put forward proposals to end U.S. fossil fuels consumption within a few decades to make the country carbon neutral. Trump has slammed the idea saying it would kill millions of jobs and crush the dreams of the poorest Americans. Jennifer Marlon a research scientist at the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication said the divergence in the way American perceive the weather is being driven by factors including the news they consume and their social circles. Liberals are more likely to expose themselves to news outlets and people who believe climate change is an urgent threat that affects current weather patterns. For more conservative Americans the link between weather and climate change is not a typical conversation Marlon said. Last year the Yale program which carries out scientific research on public knowledge about climate change set out to map the partisan divide on how people perceive the effects of global warming across the United States. It found that 22 of Republicans reported personally experiencing climate change compared to 60 of Democrats. Scientists and researchers at the University of Michigan the University of Exeter and others came to a similar conclusion in a 2018 study which found that political bias and partisan news reporting can affect whether people indicate experiencing certain extreme weather events.

Energy Secretary Rick Perry offered little explanation when protesters pressed him to explain his position on climate change at an energy conference on Tuesday. Instead he opted to tell oneyoung lady to sit down and said its OK to be skeptical about information. You are a climate denier said the first demonstrator as members of the audience booed and called for her to sit down and to get her out of here. In an attempt to defuse the tense moment Perry described the protester as one of the more interesting EIAemployees prompting laughter from the audience. Undeterred the protester kept shouting questions at Perry who then told her If youll sit down young lady Ill finish my remarks. Answer my question why will you not say that climate change is caused by carbon dioxide? she pressed. Perry was referring to remarks he made during an interview last week withCNBC Squawk Box. Perry told host Joe Kernan that carbon dioxide was not the primary control knob for climate change. While man is having an effect on climate he said most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in. His response is in stark contrast to overwhelming scientific consensus based on facts which says human activity specifically greenhouse gas emissions is the primary driver of global warming. The American Meteorological Society skewered Perry for his comments saying in a letter last week that he lacked a fundamental understanding of the science behind climate change. During his EIA conference speech on Tuesday Perry was interrupted a second time by a protester who also called him a climate denier. I think its OK for us to ask questions and be skeptical about information Perry said in response according to a EE News report of the event. Skepticism and debate are always welcome and are critically important to the advancement of science the letter said. In climate science unresolved questions remain issues that currently lack conclusive evidence. However there are also very solid conclusions that are based on decades of research and multiple lines of evidence. Skepticism that fails to account for evidence is no virtue. Later on TuesdayPerry was quizzed about climate change again during a White House press briefing arranged as part of the Trump administrations Energy Week.When asked if President Donald Trump believes in climate changePerry responded I have not had that conversation with him joining a growing list of officials who have refused to comment on the commander in chiefs position on this critical issue.

President Trump exceeded his authority when he reversed bans on offshore drilling in vast parts of the Arctic Ocean and dozens of canyons in the Atlantic Ocean a U.S. judge said in a ruling that restored the Obama era restrictions. U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason in a decision late Friday threw out Mr. Trump's executive order that overturned the bans that comprised a key part of Obama's environmental legacy. Presidents have the power under a federal law to remove certain lands from development but cannot revoke those removals Gleason said. The wording of President Obama's 2015 and 2016 withdrawals indicates that he intended them to extend indefinitely and therefore be revocable only by an act of Congress said Gleason who was nominated to the bench by Obama. The American Petroleum Institute a defendant in the case disagreed with the ruling. In addition to bringing supplies of affordable energy to consumers for decades to come developing our abundant offshore resources can provide billions in government revenue create thousands of jobs and will also strengthen our national security it said in a statement. Erik Grafe an attorney with Earthjustice welcomed the ruling saying it shows that the president cannot just trample on the Constitution to do the bidding of his cronies in the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our oceans wildlife and climate. Earthjustice represented numerous environmental groups that sued the Trump administration over the April 2017 executive order reversing the drilling bans. At issue in the case was the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Acting Assistant U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey Wood said during a hearing before Gleason in November that environmental groups were misinterpreting the intent of the law written in 1953. He said it is meant to be flexible and sensible and not intended to bind one president with decisions made by another when determining offshore stewardship as needs and realities change over time. In 2015 Mr. Obama halted exploration in coastal areas of the Beaufort and Chukchi seas and the Hanna Shoal an important area for walrus. In late 2016 he withdrew most other potential Arctic Ocean lease areas about 98 percent of the Arctic outer continental shelf. The bans were intended to protect polar bears walruses ice seals and Alaska Native villages that depend on the animals. In the Atlantic Mr. Obama banned exploration in 5937 square miles of underwater canyon complexes citing their importance for marine mammals deep water corals valuable fish populations and migratory whales.

President Donald Trump delivered a common sense appeal on Earth Day telling his followers on Twitter on Saturday afternoon Today on Earth Day we celebrate our beautiful forests lakes and land. We stand committed to preserving the natural beauty of our nation. Three hours later Trump added I am committed to keeping our air and water clean but always remember that economic growth enhances environmental protection. Jobs matter! Trumps Earth Day messages come as thousands of protesters across the country have taken to the streets to defend science against what they claim are anti science policies and proposals from the White House. Critics of Trumps energy policies seized on the opportunity to criticize the president for his Earth Day message. Roland Scahill from New York wrote If you could you would transform every inch of nature into a Trump golf course. You have no love or admiration for nature. Public radio show host Al Letson wrote How will you preserve the natural beauty of the land if you dismantle the Nathan Bernard from Brooklyn New York replied on Twitter You say Happy as you prepare to literally blow up the entire earth. Then start taking action on global warming and quit calling it fake news said self described feminist and human rights activist Cole Ledford to Trump. One of the biggest complaints from protesters is Trump has proposed cutting 54 billion from numerous federal government agencies including a cut to the Environmental Protection Agency that tops 30 percent. Trump has also issued climate and energy related executive orders the most substantial of which was signed at the end of March. In that order which is titled Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth Trump pulled back from the Obama era Clean Power Plan and lifted a 14 month moratorium on new coal leases issued to developers seeking to mine on federal lands. According to a report by Fox News the order also chips away at other regulations including scrapping language on the social cost of greenhouse gases. It initiates a review of efforts to reduce the emission of methane in oil and natural gas production as well as a Bureau of Land Management hydraulic fracturing rule to determine whether those reflect the presidents policy priorities. It also rescinds Obama era executive orders and memoranda including one that addressed climate change and national security and one that sought to prepare the country for the impacts of climate change. Trump maintains that his policies will both protect the environment and help spur job growth. Were going to have safety were going to have clean water were going to have clean air but so many regulations are unnecessary so many are job killing Trump said in March.	True	False	False	False	True
So saysJames Lovelock 98 one of the worlds pre eminent environmentalists in a wide ranging interview on todays Delingpole podcast for Breitbart. Lovelock is probably best known in environmental circles as the progenitor of Gaia theory the idea that the planet is a self regulating living organism. In 2006 he boosted his green credibility even further with his bestselling book The Revenge of Gaia whose doomsday narrative predicted that by 2100 climate change would have wiped out 80 percent of the worlds population. But Lovelock has since renounced this view. Though he still thinks carbon dioxide is a problem because of its warming effects on the climate he now believes the threat is not immediate. His change of heart was brought aboutpartly by being in Oslo when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. He was not impressed by the calibre of the scientists attached to the IPCC least of all its then head Rajendra Pachauri who turned out to be somewhat corrupt. There is global warming. But the stupid bloody academics screwed it up he says now meaning that they got their sums wrong and exaggerated the speed with which the planet is warming. A bigger worry he says are the wrong headed policies being introduced supposedly to combat climate change. He particularly loathes wind turbines because they are expensive inefficient and environmentally damaging. The only reason they are being built he says is because there is so much money in renewable energy. Im sure theres giant corruption going on. The solution he argues is nuclear power which has had a terrible press because of green propaganda most likely funded by fossil fuel industries. Nuclears health risks have been exaggerated by credulous greens who say theres no amount of radiation that cant give you cancer. But this is nonsense says Lovelock. Its as stupid as saying you should never go out of your home because if you do theres a chance youll be killed by something or other. He feels the same way about the scare about pesticides which greens have been heavily promoting ever since Rachel Carsons eco doom bestseller Silent Spring published in 1962. It was Lovelock who invented the device an Electron Capture Detector used to measure the tiniest quantities of substances be they pesticides or CFCs. What this device showed is that yes pesticides have indeed become so embedded in the food chain that they are detectable in every living thing. This has made the Greens very happy he says because it seems to confirm all their worst suspicions about pollutants chemicals and health hazards. But it shouldnt he adds because with certain exceptions they are not a problem. The fact that this stuff is there measured in picograms or fractions of a picogram is of no consequence to people he says. Lovelocks remarks are unlikely to endear him to the green movement. His Gaia hypothesis first formulated in the 1960s while he was working with NASA trying to establish how to detect life on Mars has inspired many people to join the green religion. And even like actress Emma Thompson to name their daughter after it. But far far worse in many environmentalists eyes will bethe unlikely revelation he confided to me over lunch hes a great admirer of Donald Trump whom he recognises as a fellow maverick.

Former Vice President Al Gore accused the Trump administration of trying to bury a damning government report that linked global warming to the worsening of natural disasters by quietly releasing the study on the Friday after Thanksgiving. Gore who since his time as vice president has become an outspoken advocate for the need to counteract the effects of global warming said in a statement that the White House was trying to bury this critical U.S. assessment of the climate crisis by releasing it the day after Thanksgiving. The day known as Black Fridayhas become the traditional start of the holiday shopping season and one that most Americans have off from work. Unbelievably deadly and tragic wildfires rage in the West hurricanes batter our coasts and the Trump administration chooses the Friday after Thanksgiving to try and bury this critical U.S. assessment of the climate crisis Gore said in a statement that he posted on Twitter Friday.The president may try to hide the truth but his own scientists and experts have made it as stark and clear as possible. The National Climate Assessment which is mandated by law every few years and is based on more than 1000 previous research studies details how global warming from the burning of coal oil and gas is hurting each region of the United States and how it impacts different sectors of the economy including energy and agriculture. It was written long before the deadly fires in California this month and before Hurricanes Florence and Michael raked the East Coast and Florida. Climate change is transforming where and how we live and presents growing challenges to human health and quality of life the economy and the natural systems that support us the report says. This includes worsening air pollution causing heart and lung problems more diseases from insects the potential for a jump in deaths duringheat waves and nastier allergies according to the report. Annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century more than the current gross domestic product GDP of many U.S. states the report says. It'll be especially costly on the nation's coasts because of rising seas and severe storm surges which will lower property values. And in some areas such as parts of Alaska and Louisiana coastal flooding will likely force people to relocate. While Gore has become one of the most prominent advocates for reducing carbon emissions and fighting to reduce the effect of climate change the former vice president has not been immune from claims that his work is not as altruistic as it appears. Gore left the vice presidents residence with a relatively modest net worth of 1.7 million mostly from family farm assets but since the release of his 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth and his continuing global tour to preach his message he has amassed a fortune valued at upward of 200 million. From the fossil fuels he burns jetting around the globe to his socializing with Hollywood heavy hitters to his 6500 square foot seafront home in California that cost 8.8 million some climate activists have questioned whether Gore is helping or hurting the climate fight. He is a flawed character Stephen Lacey editor in chief of the magazine GreenTechMedia said on his podcast The Energy Gang last year. Were in an era of backlash against elites so Gore a guy who bought a 6500 square foot seafront home in California for 8.8 million and who hangs around with other celebrities who talk big on climate but who live lavish lifestyles is the perfect target at this point in time. Gores lifestyle aside his statement comes amid what appears to be a continuing denial from Trump and members of his administration about the dangers climate changeposes to the environment and to the worlds economy. Earlier in the week Trump tweeted about the brutal cold spell that hit the East Coast over the Thanksgiving holiday and questioned Whatever happened to Global Warming? Friday's report seemed to anticipate such comments saying Over shorter timescales and smaller geographic regions the influence of natural variability can be larger than the influence of human activity ... Over climate timescales of multiple decades however global temperature continues to steadily increase. The Lower 48 states have warmed 1.8 degrees 1 degree Celsius since 1900 with 1.2 degrees in the last few decades according to the report. By the end of the century the U.S. will be 3 to 12 degrees 1.6 to 6.6 degrees Celsius hotter depending on how much greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere the report warns. Releasing the report on Black Friday is a transparent attempt by the Trump administration to bury this report and continue the campaign of not only denying but suppressingthe best of climate science said study co author Andrew Light an international policy expert at the World Resources Institute. During a press conference Friday officials behind the report repeatedly declined to answer questions about the timing of its release and why it contradicts public statements from Trump. Report director David Reidmiller said questions about the timing were relevant but said what was in the report was more important. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren D MA on Wednesday unveiled her plan to address environmental injustice and environmental racism which includes a 1 trillion investment into minority communities affected by industrial pollution. Warren argues that justice plays a massive role in properly addressing the climate change crisis citing studies that suggest that black and Hispanic families are disproportionately affected by air pollution caused by white people Warren calls this phenomenon environmental racism and concludes that environmental injustice is the result of decades of discrimination and environmental racism compounding in communities that have been overlooked for too long. She previewed her plan in a video clip featuring far left Squad member Rep. Rashida Tlaib D MI. We need a government thats on the side of familiesnot giant corporations polluting our communities. and I walked through 48217 the most polluted zip code in Michigan and talked with the families living every day with the effects of pollution Warren tweeted alongside the clip Like Warrens other proposals her environmental injustice plan weaves in aspects of her other campaign promises. For instance Warren says her housing plan will provide an assistance program aimed to get impoverished families out of poor pollution ridden neighborhoods and into the neighborhood of their choice. She also pledges to invest one third or 1 trillion of her climate change investment into the most vulnerable communities although she does not specify what the 1 trillion will be spent on specifically. Like most of Warrens plans her environmental injustice proposal involves the implementation of another tax. In this instance it is the Superfund Waste Tax. There are over 1300 remaining Superfund sites across the country many located in or adjacent to frontline communities. So called orphan toxic waste clean ups were originally funded by a series of excise taxes on the petroleum and chemical industries. But thanks to Big Oil and other industry lobbyists when that tax authority expired in 1995 it was not renewed. Polluters must pay for the consequences of their actions not leave them for the communities to clean up. Ill work with Congress to reinstate and then triple the Superfund tax generating needed revenue to clean up the mess. The presidential hopeful even weaves in Medicare for All as part of her broader proposal arguing such a system will make it easier for the federal government to quickly tailor health care responses to specific environmental disasters in affected communities when they occur. Warren also reiterates her pledge to ensure that employers and our government honor the promises they made to workers in fossil fuel industries. Ive fought for years to protect pensions and health benefits for retired coal workers and Ill continue fighting to maintain the solvency of multi employer pension plans she said. As president Ill protect those benefits that fossil fuel workers have earned. However Warrens role in crafting a petition to the Supreme Court on behalf of LTV Steel which helped the companys fight against a congressional requirement that it pay millions of dollars into a fund for its retired coal miners health care calls her promise into question. As Ive traveled this country Ive heard the human stories from frontline communities. Families where many people have cancer. Coastal communities facing the threat of rising sea levels. Ruined land and poisoned water Warren tweeted. These communities need justiceand I will stand with them she added	True	False	False	True	False
WASHINGTON The Democratic chairman of a key congressional panel Tuesday characterized the Trump administration's latest efforts to challenge the science behind climate change as dangerous. The comments by Rep. JosSerrano D N.Y. chairman of aHouse Appropriations subcommittee overseeing federal climate fundingcame amid news reports that White House officials are putting together a national security advisory panel aimed at countering the science behind human caused global warming. The panel's findings could give President Donald Trump who has challenged his own government's conclusions about the causes of and threats from climate change more ammunition to ignore it. Serrano who chairs the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce Justice Science and Related Agencies said that would be perilous. This unaccountable working group appears set to deliberately cherry pick data and science with the sole purpose of pushing back against the widely accepted science around climate change he said at a hearing Tuesday thatfeatured government scientists testifying on the crisis. This only serves to diminish the magnitude of this crisis and it is dangerous. Shortly after Serrano spoke Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer D N.Y. announced Senate Democrats are drafting legislation that would block the White House from creating the panel. This is maybe the most conspicuous symptom of a disease of climate denial that has infected the Republican Party and the hard right Schumer said ata Capitol Hill news conference. The science is largely settled on climate change and the threats it poses the panel. But the public relations war over how to address it is heating up as both sides navigate an issue expected to be a top issue in the 2020 election. Democrats who retook the House following the 2018 midterm election have been holding numerous hearings on the crisis. Republicans in turn have accused Democrats of trying to use climate change to impose a leftist agenda that would ruin the economy. In early Februaryprogressive Democrats unveiled their Green New Deal to remake the American economy into a social justice model focused on clean energy. But moderate Democrats have distanced themselves from the broadly worded plan that also calls for free housing health care and higher education for all Americans preferring only to endorse the portions that directly address climate change. Related 250 dead 91 billion in damages 2018 was a catastrophic year for U.S. weather 4th warmest for globe Related Green New Deal Why the GOP secretly likes Democrats' climate change plan Related Climate combat Democrats say Pentagon puts troops at risk by downplaying global warming Trump has touted environmental deregulation and his abandonment of Obama era steps to confront climate change as pillars of his America First economic agenda that has helped spur growth and lift the financial markets. But moderate Republicans are urging their party to stop challenging the science and starts confronting the problem of higher temperatures worsening natural disasters and rising sea levels. This is like a call to arms. Lets have conservatives have a discussion instead of being in denial that this is a problem former Ohio GOP Gov. John Kasich who ran against Trump in 2016 is expected to say at a speech Tuesday at the University of British Columbia. You cant just be a science denier. The White House would not confirm reports on the panel. Asked about the formation of the panel a National Security Council representative said the administration wants to ensure that decisions are fully informed and based on the most accurate and relevant information available. John Kerry who served as President Barack Obama's secretary of State wrote in a Washington Post column Tuesday that Trump should abandon the effort to discredit the science. As we careen toward irreversible environmental tipping points we have no time to waste debating alternative facts only to invest years more reestablishing trust in the real ones Kerry wrote. No panel 10 years from now can put the ice sheets back together or hold back rising tides. During Tuesday's hearingNASAEarth Science Division Director Michael Freilich was asked about the scientific integrity of the administration's most recent climate assessment released in November which White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders described as not based on facts. The report is a comprehensive scientificallyrigorouslyanalysisand assessmentif the availableinformationprimarily from the U.S. government Freilich said. We have made measurements of manyclimate indicators and many of the Earth's systems and it is clear that the climate is changing. David Doniger a climate change expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council said he was notworried about the administration's efforts to discredit the science given the preponderance of evidence. It just seems so late in the day he said. It's no longer a future hypothetical it's real. And to think that you're going to be able to stave offpublic concerns and public demand for action by ... writing a denial report seems too late.	True	True	True	True	True
flickr Tim Evanson Good news these days is hard to find. So when a vote to overturn a relatively obscure rule governing oil and gas drilling on public lands failed green groups were understandably jubilant. Fifty one senators decided to put the best interests of taxpayers and the environment first and narrowly saved a rule to limit methane emissions. This means that instead of wasting hundreds of millions of dollars worth of natural gas methane is its primary component companies will capture and sell it. Because companies drilling on public land pay royalties on the oil and gas sold this means the public will receive tens of millions of dollars in revenue from gas thats currently burned or left to leak out and pollute the atmosphere. This means more money in our coffers and less greenhouse gas in our atmosphere. But lost in the post vote beltway analysis is the fact that this is also a big win for national security. While thats not the most apparent result of the vote its one that should resonate with the Republicans who otherwise champion the military but bristle at environmental protections. Thats because the rule puts otherwise wasted methane to use boosting our energy security and reducing our dependence on foreign sources of energy. Since natural gas is sold globally and Russia is a major exporter boosting US production like this rule does cuts into Russias share of the market. The more we produce the less our European allies have to rely on Russian gas for their power supply. By making our natural gas production more efficient this rule also lessens our reliance on even less friendly fossil fuel exporters including countries to which we all too often send American soldiers. By producing energy in the United States and limiting pollution were making the world safer. Natural gas is not exactly beloved by the environmental community but it can take much of the credit for reducing the use of coal which is much dirtier and more harmful. So while some may say that Obamas environmental rules constituted a War on Coal in reality it was the cheap and plentiful supply of natural gas that put coal out of business. Ultimately well need to transition from natural gas to renewable and zero carbon energies like solar wind and next generation nuclear power if we want to maintain low cost energy and a safe and secure climate. Even with protections in place gas remains a major source of greenhouse gas emissions which cause plenty of problems. As a just published report from the intelligence community details climate change is a major military issue acting as a threat multiplier which creates the conditions and food scarcity for example breed instability and conflict. Extreme weather events made worse by climate change disrupt local communities and weaken the civic institutions that act as a bulwark against terrorists and extremism. The report also notes that the ecological damage done by climate change has human impacts. Communities that could once comfortably live off the land are forced out of the fields and forests and into urban areas where tensions run high and food supplies low. No one is saying that reducing methane leaks from gas drilling will prevent the next major conflict or humanitarian crisis. But with a problem as big as climate change and as multifaceted as national security every step is worthwhile. The better we protect our environment the better we can protect people. Making sure companies capture and sell the gas drilled on public lands ensures that the American taxpayers get the biggest return possible for leasing that land. For anyone growing cynical watching beltway politics Wednesdays victory on the methane rule was a rare and welcome reminder that common sense can still win out over the deep pockets of the oil and gas lobby. The vote was a win for taxpayers a win for the environment a win for national security and a win for democracy.	True	False	False	True	False
But the Massachusetts senators campaign is ramping up its focus on the climate crisis ahead of Thursday nights debate in Los Angeles where wildfires forced more than 40000 to flee their homes less than two months ago. Last week Warren unveiled her Blue New Deal the first comprehensive campaign proposal to revitalize coastal economies by fortifying ports spurring new markets for seafood and completely overhauling the offshore energy industry. On Wednesday she published an op ed outlining how shed target fossil fuel companies and reverse President Donald Trumps assault on environmental regulations during her first 100 days in the White House. Then on Thursday the campaign announced an endorsement from Rhiana Gunn Wright the policy researcher who helped write the Green New Deal resolution Warren co sponsored in the Senate in February. There is no dealing with climate change unless we deal with corruption Gunn Wright said in a video set to be released Thursday afternoon. Every time I read a Warren climate plan I am confident that it can take us to a Green New Deal because I see her thinking about How do we use all the levers of government? The endorsement comes as Warren is sliding in national polls which commentators have largely attributed to her apparent wobbling on Medicare for All. The loss of her brief front runner status this fall is widely seen as aiding the surge of Sen. Bernie Sanders I Vt. on her left and South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg on her right. Yet Warrens shift on climate could position her to be more competitive against Sanders who has made his own push on the issue over the past month and picked up major endorsements from youth activists. Warren and Sanders have taken different approaches on climate. Warren has put out more than half a dozen individual plans to spend a combined 3 trillion on solving specific issues like spurring a green manufacturing boom and transitioning the military off fossil fuels. Sanders by contrast has released a 16.3 trillion megaproposal for a Green New Deal that includes everything from creating a public option for electricity to spending nearly 15 billion to encourage worker owned grocery stores. Yet Warren trails Sanders only slightly on climate according to green groups rankings. Greenpeace graded her an A and Sanders an A. On a scale of 200 the Sunrise Movement the group that pushed the Green New Deal into the mainstream scored Warren at 168 and Sanders at 183. 350 Action gave both candidates three thumbs up. Sanders has picked up endorsements from the teen led U.S. Youth Climate Strike and 18 year old activist Jamie Margolin. Hes also backed by Reps. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D N.Y. and Ilhan Omar D Minn. the star first term Democrats who proposed the first two major pieces of Green New Deal legislation last month. Sanders sponsored the Senate version of Ocasio Cortezs Green New Deal for Public Housing bill last month. But the starkest contrast on the issue is between the two progressive contenders and their moderate rivals former Vice President Joe Biden and Buttigieg. Bidens campaign is stacked with gas industry allies. Buttigiegs climate adviser David Victor has been called a fossil fuel shill for taking research funding from an oil giant and deflecting blame from the industry. Its unclear how much average voters care about a candidates green credentials when the ability to defeat Trump who is widely criticized as a climate change denier is a foremost concern for Democrats and independents who lean left. Climate was the No. 2 concern after health care for Iowa caucusgoers in a Monmouth University survey from April. In California nearly half of Democratic primary voters said climate should be the top issue for the next president according to a Los Angeles Times poll published this month. The trend bears out nationally. About 38 of registered voters favored a Green New Deal proposal that spends upward of 10 trillion slashing climate changing emissions by 2030 according to an August nationwide survey commissioned by the left leaning think tank Data for Progress. That compared to 32.5 who preferred a 1.7 trillion plan to zero out emissions by 2050 more in line with what Biden proposed.	False	False	False	False	False
PARRISH Ala. AP A stinking trainload of human waste from New York City is stranded in a tiny Alabama town spreading a stench like a giant backed up toilet and the poop train is just the latest example of the South being used as a dumping ground for other states waste. In Parrish Alabama population 982 the sludge hauling train cars have sat idle near the little league ball fields for more than two months Mayor Heather Hall said. The smell is unbearable especially around dusk after the atmosphere has become heated she said. Oh my goodness its just a nightmare here she said. It smells like rotting corpses or carcasses. It smells like death. All kinds of waste have been dumped in Georgia Alabama and other Southern states in recent years including toxic coal ash from power plants around the nation. In South Carolina a plan to store radioactive nuclear waste in a rural area prompted complaints that the state was being turned into a nuclear dump. In Parrish townspeople are considering rescheduling childrens softball games or playing at fields in other communities to escape the stink. Sherleen Pike who lives about a half mile from the railroad track said she sometimes dabs peppermint oil under her nose because the smell is so bad. Would New York City like for us to send all our poop up there forever? she said. They dont want to dump it in their rivers but I think each state should take care of their own waste. Alabamas inexpensive land and permissive zoning laws and a federal ban on dumping New Yorkers excrement in the ocean got the poop train chugging experts say. Nelson Brooke of the environmental group Black Warrior Riverkeeper describes Alabama as kind of an open door rubber stamp permitting place for landfill operators. Its easy for them to zip into a rural or poor community and set up shop and start making a ton of cash he said. The poop trains cargo is bound for the Big Sky landfill about 20 miles 30 kilometers east of Parrish. The landfill has been accepting the New York sewage sludge since early 2017. Previously it was transferred from trains to trucks in nearby West Jefferson but officials there obtained an injunction to keep the sludge out of their town. The sludge smells of dead rotting animals as well as human waste West Jeffersons attorney said in a lawsuit against Big Sky Environmental LLC. It also caused the community to become infested with flies the complaint states. After West Jefferson went to court the train stopped in late January in Parrish which lacks the zoning regulations to block the train cars. Its sat there ever since. Were probably going to look at creating some simple zoning laws for the town of Parrish so we can be sure something like this does not happen again the Parrish mayor said. Hall said shes optimistic the sludge will all be trucked to the landfill soon. New York City has discontinued shipping it to Alabama for the time being said Eric Timbers a city spokesman. Its waste recovered from the sewage treatment process and often called biosolids has been sent out of state partly because the federal government in the late 1980s banned disposal in the Atlantic Ocean. In an earlier trash saga a barge laden with 3186 tons 2890 metric tons of non toxic paper and commercial garbage from Long Island and New York City wandered the ocean for months in 1987 seeking a place to dump it after plans by a private developer to turn it into methane gas in North Carolina fell through. It was turned away by North Carolina Alabama Mississippi Louisiana Texas Florida Mexico Belize and the Bahamas. Brookes Black Warrior Riverkeeper group last year opposed continued permits for the Big Sky landfill. Rural parts of Alabama are prime targets for landfills that accept out of state waste it argued meaning that Alabama was becoming a dumping ground for the rest of the nation. Big Sky officials did not return multiple email and phone messages from The Associated Press seeking comment. Nationally the waste and recycling industry generates more than 93 billion in gross revenue annually said Brandon Wright a spokesman for the National Waste Recycling Association. Wright said there are many reasons waste is sometimes transported out of state. There might not be enough landfill space nearby and the waste has to go somewhere so it gets transported out of state he said. Alabama and other Southern states have a long history accepting waste from around the U.S. A former state attorney general once described a giant west Alabama landfill as Americas Pay Toilet. It was among the nations largest hazardous waste dumps when it opened in 1977. At its peak the landfill took in nearly 800000 tons 72570 metric tons of hazardous waste annually. Plans to dump coal ash in Southern states have been particularly contentious. Each year U.S. coal plants produce about 100 million tons 90 metric tons of coal ash and other waste more than 4 million tons of it wound up in an Alabama landfill following a 2008 spill in Tennessee. In Parrish the mayor hopes the material in the train cars is removed before the weather warms up. Were moving into the summer and the summer in the South is not forgiving when it comes to stuff like this she said.	False	False	False	True	False
President Trump Donald John TrumpJoe Kennedy says he's considering Senate run Biden tells supporters after flub 'I'm not going nuts' Seoul's relations with Pyongyang and Tokyo need a jolt of reality MORE on Monday touted his environmentalist credentials hours after skipping a Group of Seven G 7 summit meeting focused on climate oceans and biodiversity. At a closing press conference before departing the summit Trump was asked whether he still harbors skepticism about climate change. He did not directly answersaying heis an environmentalist but that he is unwilling to sacrifice the country's economic success to protect the environment. Im an environmentalist. A lot of people dont understand that Trump said citing his experience filing environmental impact statements for real estate developments. I think I know more about the environment than most people he added. I want clean air. I want clean water. I want a wealthy country. I want a spectacular country with jobs with pensions with so many things. And thats what were getting. At the same time its very important to me... we have to maintain this incredible place that weve all built Trump continued. The U.S. has become a much richer country. And thats a good thing not a bad thing. Because that wealth allows us to take care of people. Earlier Monday the president skipped a G 7 session focused on climate and sent another administration official in his place. The heads of government of the other six nations that comprise the G 7 were there. During the climate meeting leaders approved a 20 million aid package to help Brazil and other South American countries address fires engulfing the Amazon rainforest French President Emmanuel Macron Emmanuel Jean Michel MacronTrump says he's 'an environmentalist' after skipping G 7 climate meeting Trump says he'd meet with Iranians under 'right' circumstances Macron US France reached 'very good agreement' on digital tax MORE said. Trump has in the past characterized climate change as a hoax mocked the idea of global warming by citing winter storms and cast doubt on government reports warning about how the changing environment might adversely affect the economy. His administration has rolled backa number of environmental protections enacted by the Obama administration and Trump announced shortly after taking office that he would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement that seeks to combat global emissions. The president on Monday cited the expansion of energy exports under his administration and the opening of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as ways he has made the country more prosperous. Im not going to lose that wealth he said. I'm not going to lose that on dreams. On windmills.	True	True	False	True	True
As soon as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma made landfall in the U.S. scientists politicians and journalists began to discuss the role of climate change in natural disasters. Although a clear scientific consensus has emerged over the past decade that climate change influences hurricanes in the long run its effect upon any individual storm is unclear. Anyone trying to score political points after a natural disaster should take a deep breath and review the science first. As a meteorologist with access to the best weather forecast model data available I watched each hurricanes landfall with particular interest. Harvey and Irma broke the record 12 year major hurricane landfall drought on the U.S. coastline. Since Wilma in October 2005 31 major hurricanes had swirled in the North Atlantic but all failed to reach the U.S. with a Category 3 or higher intensity. Even as we worked to divine exactly where the hurricanes would land a media narrative began to form linking the devastating storms to climate change. Some found it ironic that states represented by climate deniers were being pummeled by hurricanes. Alarmists reveled in the irony that Houston home to petrochemical plants was flooded by Harvey while others gleefully reported that President Trumps Mar a Lago might be inundated by Irma. How to put these two hurricanes into proper context? An informative website from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration synthesizes reams of research literature on the links between hurricanes and global warming. Over the next century climate models generally indicate fewer but stronger stormsbetween 2 and 11 greater average storm intensitywith substantially increased rain rates. Against the background of slow sea level rise explosive coastal population growth will overwhelmingly exacerbate any hurricanes damages. In the aggregate the global warming signal may just now be emerging out of our noisy observational records and we may not know certainly for several decades. These conclusions are hardly controversial in the climate science community. My own research cited in a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report found that during the past half century tropical storms and hurricanes have not shown an upward trend in frequency or accumulated energy. Instead they remain naturally variable from year to year. The global prevalence of the most intense storms Category 4 and 5 has not shown a significant upward trend either. Historical observations of extreme cyclones in the 1980s especially in the Southern Hemisphere are in sore need of reanalysis. By focusing on whether climate change caused a hurricane journalists fail to appreciate the complexity of extreme weather events. While most details are still hazy with the best climate modeling tools the bigger issue than global warming is that more people are choosing to live in coastal areas where hurricanes certainly will be most destructive. The nascent field of attribution science attempts to explain how climate change may affect characteristics of a given hurricane using models in what if mode. Such research requires a faithful reproduction of events and predictions of the future constrained by subjective choices within computer models. This research also takes timewhich means other scientists must examine the evidence with patience and judiciousness not usually seen on Twitter or cable news. Still the scientific community already knows plenty about hurricanes and climate changeknowledge it has accumulated over two decades through peer reviewed research academic conferences and voluminous national and international assessments. Yet climate scientists all too often speculate during interviews rather than refer to IPCC reports or their cousins from the U.S. National Climate Assessment. Some climate scientists have peddled tenuous theories with no contemporaneous research evidence. Advocacy groups package these talking points for easy consumption by journalists who eagerly repeat them. The historical record books contain dozens of devastating hurricane landfalls over the past century any of which if repeated would be catastrophic regardless of additional climate change effects. To prepare for the next hurricane the U.S. needs the best weather forecasts evacuation plans and leadership. These plans should be built on sound science not speculation overselling or exaggeration. Hurricane science in this political climate already has enough spin. Mr. Maue a research meteorologist is an adjunct scholar at the Cato Institute.	True	False	False	True	True
WASHINGTON The Republican response to an alarming new United Nations report on looming catastrophes caused by global warming suggests that little if anything will be done by the U.S. in the near future to address the threat of rising oceans worsening droughts and raging wildfires. They might as well be calling on me to sprout wings and fly to Canada for the summer Sen. Roger Wicker R Miss. a climate change skeptic said of the actions urged by the report. Issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the report found that the world is rapidly running out of time to scale back carbon emissions to keep planetary warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above pre industrial levels. If the flow of greenhouse gases continues to stream into the atmosphere at the current rate the IPCC determined the global mean temperature will likely rise to the 1.5 degree mark sometime between 2030 and 2052. Such a rise in global mean temperatures within that time frame would mean calamitous flooding of small islands and major coastal metropolises like New York City the report said. Warming beyond that level to 2 degrees and over would significantly exacerbate such disasters. The reports authors projected that staying at or below 1.5 degrees Celsius will require slashing the worlds greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030 and reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 targets that many GOP lawmakers brushed off as infeasible. Theres not enough money in the world to pay for that Kennedy said. Thats the problem with the U.N. that they come up with these policy ideas that are just La La Land. How is that new? Theyve said the same thing before Sen. Marco Rubio R Fla. said adding that his responsibility was to balance those interests raised in that report with his states broader economic and security interests. It hasnt been on my finance agenda or banking agenda Scott said referring to the Senate committees he serves on and the issues on which he focuses his attention. The IPCC recommended several steps needed to reverse carbon dioxide emissions including replacing the use of fossil fuels with renewable energy such as wind and solar as well as growing more forests which naturally recycles CO2. It also said that employing new technologies to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere will be necessary to achieve the emissions target. We should be doing everything we can said Natalie Mahowald a climate scientist at Cornell University and lead author of the reports first chapter. Thats the main thing about getting to the emmissions goal is just how aggressively we have to act in every different sector of our society. Only one GOP senator approached by HuffPost signaled an openness to delving into the report Sen. Bob Corker R Tenn.. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he said he was looking at the possibility of holding a hearing on the matter. The Senate GOP majority likely to remain in effect after Novembers elections is dominated by lawmakers skeptical of human caused climate change such as Jim Inhofe R Okla.. He oncethrew a snowball on the Senate floor in an attempt to prove that global warming is nothing more than a hoax. Coming from a top oil producing stateInhofe has long railed against the IPCC as a biased left wing organization. On Wednesday he claimed that the panel recognized by others as the worlds leading authority on climate change had been totally discredited and dismissed its latest findings.

California continues to pass the most ambitious laws in the world to expand clean energy and combat climate change. This summer in the midst of unprecedented chaos and dysfunction in Washington California lawmakers stepped up with a bipartisan solution to one of the most pressing challenges facing our state this nation and the world. Cap and trade is an important tool in Californias climate policy portfolio. It sends a price signal to industries to reduce their carbon pollution while generating billions of dollars in revenue for investments in clean transportation and direct pollution reduction. However its hardly the only weapon in our climate arsenal and California simply cannot meet our world leading greenhouse gas reduction goals with cap and trade alone. In fact the challenge before us is a case study in market failures to suggest that market based policies on their own will solve this existential challenge is nave at best. Thats why Californias comprehensive suite of climate policies including our mandates to generate clean energy improve energy efficiency and reduce vehicle tailpipe emissions strikes a necessary balance between market based and direct regulations. As California edges out the United Kingdom to become the fifth largest economy in the world with the state unemployment rate at historic lows sound budgeting and a robust social safety net weve proven that strong climate and clean air policies can go hand in hand with economic growth. Thanks to policies mandating clean energy development Californias electric grid is one of the least carbon intensive in the world. Weve turned clean energy into a pillar of our economy that now employs over half a million Californians ten times the number of Americans employed in the coal industry. Clean renewable energy is also now cheaper than fossil fuels on a straight dollar for dollar basis in many parts of America. Thats why red states like Texas Oklahoma and Iowa are quietly spending more on zero carbon wind energy than ever before. Clean energy isnt just good for the planet its good for consumers monthly utility bills and for the economy. Setting a target of 100 percent clean renewable energy as my Senate Bill 100 will do if signed into law means that California will continue to be the worlds clean energy superpower. Other policies promoting energy and fuel efficiency are also major tools driving both innovation and pollution reductions. Our decades long commitment to energy efficiency which began with Jerry Browns first stint as Governor has not only kept our states electricity consumption flat despite a steadily rising population it has kept Californians energy spending among the lowest in the nation. These programs create local jobs incentivize massive private sector investment and are a big reason why California remains Americas capital of innovation. Most importantly policies that directly reduce pollution are our most effective tools to improve public health and quality of life in the most disproportionately impacted communities. California is home to six of the ten most polluted cities in America for ozone and particle pollution according to the American Lung Association. The families sick from breathing dirty air surely would not consider Californias air quality regulations superfluous. We need all of these tools to be able to reduce pollution drive technological innovation create jobs and expand economic growth all while keeping costs stable for consumers and businesses. Taken together they provide a comprehensive platform for clean energy and climate policy that can serve as a golden standard and a beacon of hope for the rest of the planet until common sense returns to the White House.

China is helping Pakistan build up its energy sector including a 3.5 billion joint venture to extract 1.3 gigawatts worth of coal in the Thar desert. Pakistan plans to use Thar brown coal to bring electricity to the millions of people living in energy poverty or suffering through daily blackouts. The country could get 24 percent of its electricity from coal by 2020 with the help of China. Its one of many coal projects China is backing abroad while it cuts coal mining and power generation at home to fight pollution. China also promised to peak greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 as part of the Paris climate agreement. Chinas energy ministry canceled more than 100 coal fired power plants that were being planned or being built in January. The country reaffirmed its commitment to its Paris commitments after U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order rolling back global warming regulations in late March. As a responsible developing country Chinas plan determination and policy to tackle climate change is resolute Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told the Associated Press. Chinas coal use fell nearly 5 percent last year but the country still gets 62 percent of its electricity from coal fired power plants. The countryscut in domestic coal use comes as they fund coal projects abroad including the Engro mine in the Thar desert. Another Chinese joint venture plans to build another coal project near the Engro mine in June. Another block of coal will begin production for electricity generation by 2019 reports the Salt Law Tribune. China has also backed coal fired power plants in Southeast Asian countries including Vietnam. China is involved in financing or building at least 79 coal fired power projects around the world. The total generating capacity of those projects is 52 gigawatts. Why the push abroad? It provides Chinese firms and investors with opportunities to make money off coal projects at a time when thats less politically popular in China. Coal workers also travel to these projects keeping them from losing their jobs. The Engro mine for example has 350 Chinese workers and the return on equity for Chinese investors is about 30 percent according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

The federal rule required vehicles to average 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025 nearly double todays standard. The new standard provided significant environmental and financial benefits if fully implemented. Under those rules oil consumption would fall by 12 billion barrels tailpipe emissions would halve and fuel efficiency would nearly double saving consumers 3200 to 5700 in gasoline costs over a vehicles lifetime. The regulation would have prevented 6 billion metric tons of planet warming gases equivalent to a years worth of pollution from 150 power plants from ever entering the atmosphere. In its 38 page finding the EPA cited lower gas prices and changes to consumer acceptance of advanced technology vehicles as reasons the original determinations no longer represent realistic assumptions. The agency also said it planned to reconsider how climate change factored in to regulation noting that the social cost of carbon and energy security valuation ... should also be updated to be consistent with the literature and empirical evidence. The memo made no mention of climate change. Automakers agreed to the rule in 2012 as part of the first major overhaul of fuel efficiency standards since the 1970s. But the policy set an April 2018 deadline to review the standards and tweak them if they proved too expensive or impossible to meet. In January 2017 the Obama administration attempted to lock the regulation in place by issuing a positive assessment of the costs and feasibility of the regulations. Despite overwhelmingly supporting the agreement seven years ago carmakers began lobbying then President elect Donald Trump to reverse the Obama ruling almost immediately after the 2016 election.Automakers missed their emissions target for the first time last year even though they achieved record fuel economy in part because the companies boosted production of gas guzzling SUVs. The decision to rewrite the rule puts the EPA at loggerheads with California regulators who agreed in 2011 as part of the rule to align their tailpipe emissions standards with the national levels. The deal guaranteed consistent mileage and emissions rules nationwide allowing automakers to save money by manufacturing vehicles to one standard. Undoing the rule threatens to upend that uniformity. Under the Clean Air Act California is allowed to set vehicle emissions standards higher than the rest of the country and with nearly 35.4 million registered vehicles the state commands powerful influence over the American auto market. A dozen other states including New York Massachusetts and Pennsylvania have historically followed Californias lead. Cooperative federalism doesnt mean that one state can dictate standards for the rest of the country Pruitt said. It is in Americas best interest to have a national standard and we look forward to partnering with all states including California as we work to finalize that standard. The decision prompted sharp criticism from former EPA administrators. Carol Browner who served as the agencys chief from 1993 to 2001 said Pruitt was wrong to cast California as wielding outsize influence over the regulations. She noted that the Golden State compromised on a number of rules including a zero emissions vehicle program. This is all just another case of this administration wanting to make good on their political rhetoric and in this case not even wanting to make good for our own automakersMcCarthy now the director of Harvard Universitys Center for Health and the Global Environmenttold HuffPost. We support increasing clean car standards through 2025 and are not asking for a rollback they wrote in a blog post on Medium. We want one set of standards nationally along with additional flexibility to help us provide more affordable options for our customers. The EPA never implemented the Clean Power Plan the signature Obama era rule to reduce emissions from the utility sector. But the law is still on the books and the EPA has yet to propose a replacement that meets the legal requirements set by a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that found the agency is obliged to regulate any type of air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare including greenhouse gases. The EPA and the Department of the Interior moved to eliminate Obama era rules restricting methane emissions from gas drilling sites. But last July the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled against the EPAs plan to suspend the rule. In February the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that the Interior Departments plan to delay methane regulations was untethered to evidence.

The sun dips towards the sea on Xifara beach as Stella Cervello walks along picking up handfuls of plastic waste. There are shredded plastic bags a glowstick from a rave on nearby Mykonos and even a food carton from Turkey. Look you can see all the microplastics she says pointing at a mass of coloured dots bobbing on the waves. Like many islands in Greece's Cycladic region waste production on the island of Paros explodes in summer when over 400000 tourists join a local population of just 13000. Paros is now at the centre of a drive to turn itself into the world's first island that is truly free of plastic waste. It looks like quite a challenge. In high season the white and blue painted cafes that line the picturesque streets get through 1000 plastic takeaway cups a day. Thousands of plastic bottles of water are shipped in daily because many believe the tap water is undrinkable although the water company insists that is wrong. You are really exposed to the reality of the situation when you live by the sea says campaigner Zana Kontamanoli. The Greek waste management system suffered heavy cuts during the country's financial crisis meaning recycling is often not separated and many landfill sites are not up to EU standards. A shocking 95 of waste in the Mediterranean is plastic. But within three years this may change. Paros residents Stella Cervello and Zana Kontamanoli are behind the Clean Blue Paros initiative that involves the local municipality as well as several NGOs. I was really shocked when I arrived. I could not believe how many plastic cups were flying around by the beach says Ms Cervello who began trying to make the island more sustainable when she moved here from France in 2016. And while she was starting up a Facebook group and talking to businesses about possible alternatives to plastic Jo Royle from the charity Common Seas was trying to identify a Mediterranean island that could become a model for a future free of plastic waste. Islands provide a microcosm of a system that allows us to clearly see material flows says Ms Royle. We've got one port where everything comes in and goes off so we can really evaluate whether the systems we're piloting work. Paros was chosen because its changes in population give it complexity and because she found out when she visited the island that people were already working on the issue. Other islands such as the Seychelles archipelago have banned single use plastics but this is the first time an entirely new approach is being taken to make an island completely free of plastic waste. Huge signs now greet tourists at the airport to tell them about the Paros initiative. It's what the island needs says Ms Cervello. The team's first task was to convince as many local businesses as possible to drop pointless plastics such as straws and bottled water. Out of 70 businesses we've spoken to 50 have signed up says Zana Kontamanoli. Fourteen businesses are piloting the separate collection of plastic cups and bottles which have a higher value recycle rate. The plastic will then be recycled on the mainland into something that can return to the island such as benches. Research shows that when recycling is separated people are less likely to just chuck all their waste in and contaminate it says Kontamanoli. However there are still many obstacles facing the team. Most bins on the island do not close so the strong Aegean winds blow waste into the sea. And while many residents are enthusiastic about the project there are still some that need convincing. Not serving bottled water has harmed us admits Andy Kirk owner of Nemobar the first business to sign up to the scheme. Even when we explain we have a water filter many customers don't like it. But we've stuck to our guns. Another sticking point has been convincing bakeries and pharmacies to stop using plastic bags. The team has managed to collect thousands of used hotel bed sheets which would usually be sent to landfill and are making them into tote bags. In our audit we found that on some parts of the island 60 of waste was recyclable so there needs to be more education says Kontamanoli. The team is focusing its education efforts on the island's 2500 schoolchildren. Most drink one small bottle of water a day each so they are being given refillable bottles while water filters are being installed at schools. Children are powerful drivers of change because they go home and talk to their parents about it says Zana Kontamanoli. Although they are only six months in the team are optimistic that big changes can be made as soon as the tourist season is over and residents have more time on their hands to overhaul how they do things. Plastic pollution is very complex and there's not one solution says Jo Royle. But we hope if these systems work they can be applied elsewhere too.	False	True	False	True	False
We told you last week that the DNC refused to allow their 2020 Democratic candidates to debate the issue of Climate Change. They were afraid that it would end up hurting whichever candidate goes into the general election next year. Well this is the end result of that decision. CNN has announced one massive town hall on Climate Change not massive in crowd size but massive in the amount of time it will take CNN on Tuesday announced the candidate lineup for its unprecedented prime time event focused on the climate crisis. Ten Democratic presidential hopefuls will appear in New York at back to back town halls on Wednesday September 4 taking audience questions about their climate plans as scientists sound the alarm about global warming. Along with the candidates the network also announced the CNN journalists and the approximate appearance times for the presidential hopefuls during the seven hour live event. Here are the details of this marathon non debate town hall Id rather fall into a 40000 foot deep man made hole in Russia than watch Democrats tell us how were all going to die in 12 years if we dont get rid of fossil fuels.

LOS ANGELES Reuters One of the worst droughts in California history has officially ended Governor Jerry Brown declared but not before it strained the states farm economy and threatened water supplies for millions of residents. Months of drenching storms and melting snowpack have replenished reservoirs which began drying up in late 2011. That allowed Brown to lift most stipulations of an emergency order he implemented in January 2014 about two years after the conditions crossed the line into drought. Brown also said the need for conservation continued. Officials will still require some long term water use limits imposed last year and are developing water preservation standards for urban agencies. This drought emergency is over but the next drought could be around the corner Brown said in a statement. Conservation must remain a way of life. The drought cost the agricultural economy billions killed an estimated 100 million trees led a half million acres of farmland to be fallowed and deprived some communities of reliable sources of drinking water. In April 2015 when the states snowpack hit its lowest since 1950 at 5 percent of its historic average Brown stood on a dry mountain that was normally blanketed in snow at that time of year and ordered urban areas to reduce water use by 25 percent. As of last week the snowpack stood at 150 percent of normal. The 2015 order led environmentalists to complain that the state which leads the nation in production of fruits and vegetables did too little to force farmers to conserve water. For their part farmers said they received far less water than promised by state and federal authorities. On Friday the Democratic governor lifted the drought declaration in all counties except four mostly in the states agricultural Central Valley. Its worth taking a moment to be grateful for all the rain and snow out there Felicia Marcus chair of the State Water Resources Control Board told reporters on a conference call after the governors announcement. California officials have credited residents for doing their part to conserve water by taking shorter showers and ripping out grass lawns to install landscaping that requires minimal irrigation among other measures. Even though the drought is officially over groundwater supplies remain below normal the Natural Resources Defense Council cautioned in a statement. Year after year California continues to use more water than is made available by nature Kate Poole director of the groups water and wildlife project said in a statement.	True	False	False	True	True
This week President Donald Trump was to meet with senior administration officials to discuss the deal and whether the United States should withdraw from it. The meeting was postponed indefinitely and with key Trump advisers divided over the issue it is still uncertain what Trump will finally do about the accord. But advocates of greater federal regulations to address climate change are already expressing dismay about the administration's stance. It's no secret that Trump has called climate change a hoax in the past. Last month he signed an executive order rolling back Obama era climate regulations which will initiate a review of the Clean Power Plan an effort to cut carbon dioxide emissions that Obama started. And Trump's pick to run the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt has made it clear addressing climate change will not be an urgent priority for the agency under his watch declining to say after his confirmation whether he would forbid EPA scientists from studying the human connection to the issue. We have many priorities at the agency. We must focus on those he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on The Situation Room in February rattling off other needs such as improving air quality. He declined to answer repeated questions as to whether he would allow climate change research. It's a shame for us to lose our leadership position said Christine Todd Whitman the EPA administrator during the George W. Bush administration. We are an extraordinarily innovative capable nation. We can come up with better ways to provide power to people and still keep jobs. This idea that environmental protection and economic growth are contrary are just wrong and we've proven that over the years as we have reduced the pollutants in the air increased the population increased our energy demand and watched our GDP more than double. We've seen we can do this Whitman continued. We've done it in the past we can do it again. We can't have a thriving economy if you don't have a healthy clean environment. Adam Koniuszewski project leader of the Gorbachev Climate Change Task Force a think tank that focuses on global challenges posed by climate change agreed with Whitman. President Trump has an America First policy he said. But in terms of climate leadership it is exactly the opposite. Promoting a coal or fossil fuel based economy will in reality leave America last in terms of a low carbon economy in the 21st century. China is already taking the lead when it comes to renewable energy both solar and wind power. America must look forward to and innovate for 21st century solutions. An emphasis on coal and the energy sources that propelled the industrial revolution is like returning to the Stone Age. Trump's executive order also lifts the moratorium on coal mining on federal lands something that William Becker executive director of the Presidential Climate Action Project called a cruel political stunt designed to rally the support of coal miners but which won't bring back many jobs. What we need to do is make sure the transition to clean energy which is inevitable is a just and fair transition one that helps coal dependent communities and workers make transitions into other kinds of jobs Becker said. There's plenty to do out there including environmental restoration positions he said. Coal jobs are not going to come back. There may be a little surge in them but not much. It's technology or mechanization that's cost most of the jobs this past century in the coal industry. And now of course it's coal's inability to compete with natural gas on price for power generation. The market conditions are what's causing the coal industry to decline and there's not much the President can do to reverse that trend. Trump has proposed massive cuts at the EPA which Whitman believes is going to imperil its mission going forward. The EPA can't survive with 31 cuts to the budget she said. That's going to really make it impossible for the agency to continue its mission which is to protect public health and the environment.	True	True	False	True	False
Freshman Democrat Alexandria Ocasio Cortez has some lofty goals for herself and for America with the benefits definitelymore geared to benefit her. Meanwhile her plans for us are incredibly costly and not just because shes pushing a failed economic system for us to operate under. Ocasio Cortezs Green New Deal as Fox News highlighted on Tuesday is unprecedentedly expensive. The plan involves completely removing any and all uses of fossil fuels within America and moving to 100 percent renewable energy. The New York Democrat says the plan will take ten years. The cost of this ten year plan?7 trillion. As Ive highlighted previously the plan is beyond bad. Not onlywould it indebt us to Russia and China who hold the vast majority of the rare earth materials needed to build the tidal wave of renewable energy devices wed need to keep up with the nations energy needs but the wind farms tidal generators and solar farms have proven to be more deadly to the environment than oil spills. Hundreds of thousands of birds many of them protected species die at the hands of wind turbines yearly. Tidal generators beach whales with such frequency that if it were a Republican backed project environmental groups would be having conniptionfits and endless marches. Still Ocasio Cortez believes that if this plan gets put into action itll solve every problem under the sun including racism and bigotry. Whats more the young democratic socialist proclaims that if we dont do it then were all going to die in 12 years. When pie in the sky thinking meets end of times conspiracy theories we get something like this. A scenario where were all going to die unless we do exactly the thing some brave Democrat has proposed. All we have to do is give up our common sense.	False	True	False	True	False
Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke suggested that climate change may have a role in the recent wildfires that have ravaged California. When asked by CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang whether he accepted that climate change was part of the problem Zinke said of course. He also acknowledged that temperatures are rising. However Zinke also reiterated an argument that he made earlier this week blaming environmental groups for preventing dead trees from being cleared due to their opposition to the logging industry. The only endangered species happens to be a logger Zinke said. Earlier this week Zinke blamed environmental terrorist groups for California's destructive wildfires in an interview with Breitbart Radio. We have been held hostage by these environmental terrorist groups that have not allowed public access that have refused to allow the harvest of timber Zinke told Breitbart Monday. On Sunday Zinke said that the wildfires had nothing to do with climate change in an interview with local news station KCRA TV. He suggested that environmental groups had prevented timber salvage operations meaning that forests could not be cleared of flammable detritus. I've heard the climate change argument back and forth. This has nothing to do with climate change. This has to do with active forest management Zinke said. President Trump tweeted earlier in August that California wildfires were made so much worse by bad environmental laws and called for clearing trees to prevent fires. The Mendocino Complex Fire north of San Francisco is the largest wildfire in state history and has scorched over 400 square miles. More than 14000 firefighters are responding to over a dozen major blazes throughout California.	True	False	False	False	False
In his five months as EPA Administrator former Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt is an aggregating impeachable offense ever giving fuller meaning to Alexander Hamiltons Federalist 65 elaboration of what constitutes high crimes and misdemeanors to wit Impeachable offenses arise from the abuse or violation of some public trust and relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself. Riding into office on the back of 14 lawsuits he filed against the EPA Pruitt took his oath of office to uphold the laws of the land and promptly proceeded to do just the opposite. Using the mantra of states rights as his corporate fig leaf and wildly accusing EPA scientists of being unscientific he has moved to undo delay or otherwise block more than 30 environmental rules according to the July 1 2017 New York Times. His tenure thus far at the EPA is the stuff of corporate wish lists meeting privately with the worst industrial perpetrators of silent violence charitably described as pollution and huddling with industry lobbyists and corporate lawyers who are eager for Pruitt to dismantle his own agency the federal manager of environmental violence to air water soil and food. Mr. Pruitt makes himself vulnerable with all the ex parte contacts and corporate advisors to many serious offenses including a violation of the procedures of the Federal Advisory Committee Act b conflict of interest rules c violation of both criminal and civil laws by the overreaching industry lobbyists who constitute Pruitts tight cadre of clenched jawed political appointees. History provides precedents of how the boundless zealotry of new wrecking crews ultimately leads to self inflicted wounds and scandals. Republicans in the House of Representatives are quite familiar with trying to impeach a civil officer. For many months prior to the November election they were hounding with baseless impeachment threats John Koskinen then director of the IRS and one of the most honorable civil servants in a generation. So fervid and ill tempered was their partisan zeal that they also took it out on the IRSs budget already lower than it was several years earlier and cut it further to the bone. This fulminating vendetta widely reported has led to millions of taxpayers waiting on the phone with the IRS to get served or not be served at all. Most ironically the Republicans assured that the woefully understaffed IRS could collect even less of the estimated 350 billion in annual unpaid taxes thereby expanding the federal deficit they so often decry for political expediency. Pruitt like most captured corporatists has ignored the objections to his policies from the 15000 employees of the EPA hoping that many will leave the agency and further weaken the environmental health and safety efforts that he abhors. He doesnt want them around because he cannot rebut their scientific arguments for retaining existing standards which would protect our environment from deadly toxins. He is also hostile to the precautionary principle which shifts the burden of proof to the progenitors of new chemical or particulate or gas into the environment. When you go through the list of health standards slated for Pruitts abolition you wonder whether there are any limits to his cold blooded corporatized agenda. So extreme is his corporate ardor that there will undoubtedly be lawless actions coming from his precipitous acts which he rightly believes will not be subject to restraint from the Trump White House or the Republican controlled Congress. Pruitts fevered mind thinks like this Climate change is a hoax. Methane gas which is 40 times more harmful to global warming than carbon dioxide should not be subject to the modest Obama era required disclosures. The industries that are most responsible for pollution should be in charge of their own enforcement. The EPAs already grossly inadequate budget should be cut further. Attempts to curb pollution in our air and waterways should be revoked. Pesticides like chlorpyrifos found to be dangerous after years of study should be pushed back for reconsideration in short to be shelved. Rules on methane leaks from drilling oil and gas wells should be obstructed through delays or revision. Pruitt had a private meeting with corporate lobbyists at Trump International Hotel which is a venue for recurring violations of the Emoluments Clause due to its Trump enriching expenditures by foreign interests. Thats when you know that the officious Pruitt doesnt even care about appearances much less the perils of lawless and secretive influence peddling that enriches President Trumps investments. Members of Congress Democratic and Republican must ensure accountability for this rogue administrator. Take close note of his non compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act and keep in mind that political ideologies will not protect your children or vulnerable relatives and friends form environmental toxins. Conservative lungs and other bodily organs are as vulnerable to pollution bred terminal ailments and the violent effects of climate change as their liberal counterparts. Lets be clear about what is at issue here. Pruitt is extinguishing life saving and disease preventing health standards that were vetted in open procedures that were open to input by the commercial interested affected which usually leads to diluting the final regulation and which have solid scientific basis to protect vulnerable populations. Consequently Pruitts rollbacks suspensions or delays if allowed to persist and expand will lead loss and deprivation of American lives including children the future of our country thereby increasing healthcare costs family anguish and other disruptions of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Pruitt and his cohorts are a clear and present danger to America. He will demonstrate in the coming weeks and months how deserving he is of impeachment in the House of Representatives and conviction in the U.S. Senate. That is if he doesnt resign or be forced to resign due to his own cruelty recklessness and running afoul of the law.	False	False	True	True	False
A federal judge blocked construction on the Keystone XL pipeline on Thursday. In a 54 page decision Judge Brian Morris of the U.S. District Court in Montana granted an injunction to the Indigenous Environmental Network and Northern Plains Resource Council against the U.S. State Department the TransCanada Keystone Pipeline and the TransCanada Corporation. TransCanada is blocked from engaging in any activity in furtherance of the construction or operation of Keystone and associated facilities until the State Department can confirm that doing so would not violate the Administrative Procedure Act or the National Environmental Policy Act. Morris had ruled in August that the State Department had to reach a conclusion on the environmental impacts of the pipeline but determined Thursday that the departments analysis had left out information he considered to be crucial.He also accused the State Department of usingoutdated information about potential environmental impacts instead ofthe best scientific and commercial data available. These omissions require a remand with instructions to the Department to satisfy its obligations under NEPA Morris wrote. In its initial report the State Department had said that any climate related impacts from the pipeline would prove inconsequential. However Morris argued that the department had not given areasoned explanation for how it came to this conclusion. TransCanada has claimed that the pipeline would result in few oil spills by decreasing the amount of oil being transported by rail and lower greenhouse gas emissions by lowering the amount of oil being transported by ocean tanker. If constructed the Keystone XL Pipeline would stretch from Hardisty Alberta to Nebraska where it would connect to an existing pipeline going to the Gulf Coast. In November 2015 former President Barack Obamas administration blocked the pipelines construction citing potential environmental impact. Two days after taking office President Donald Trump signed an executive order reauthorizing the pipeline.	False	False	False	True	False
Last week a federal judgedismissedNew York Citys climate change lawsuit against five major oil companies. Last month another federal judgedismissedsimilar global warming claims against oil firms brought by San Francisco and Oakland. More than a dozen climate lawsuits filed during the last year by cities and counties seek billions of dollars in damages from oil and gas companies. But it appears that all of these lawsuits will eventually be thrown out. New York Citysoughtmonetary damages from BP Chevron Conoco Phillips ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell as compensation for damage caused by dangerous global warming allegedly caused by the companies. But John F. Keenan District Court judge for the Southern District of New York disagreed and dismissed the complaint. Judge Keenanruledthat it would thus be illogical to allow the City to bring state law claims when courts have found that these matters are areas of federal concern that have been delegated to the Executive Branch as they require a uniform national solutionGlobal warming and solutions thereto must be addressed by the other two branches of government. On June 25 on the west coast US District Judge William Alsupthrewout similar suits brought by the California cities of Oakland and San Francisco. Judge Alsup stated it is true that carbon dioxide released from fossil fuels has caused and will continue to cause global warming. But against that negative we must weigh this positive Our industrial revolution and the development of our modern world have literally been fueled by oil and coal. Without those fuels virtually all of our monumental progress would have been impossible. Judge Alsup concluded that the courts should defer to the legislative and executive branches. Note that Judge Alsup is not a conservative judge. Alsup was nominated by President Bill Clinton in 1999. In January he blocked Trump Administration efforts to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA program. Several other climate lawsuits arependingin California. In July of last year San Mateo County Marin County and Imperial Beach filed separate suits against 37 oil and gas companies in California Superior Court. Last December Santa Cruz and Santa Cruz County also brought suits in California Superior Court against 29 companies. In January the City of Richmond California and the County of Contra Costa also filed claims against 29 companies. Other state entities alsoinitiatedlegal action this year. In April the city of Boulder Boulder County and San Miguel County filed a suit in Colorado against Exxon and Suncor. In May King County Washington the home of Seattle filed suit against five companies. Just this month the state of Rhode Island and the City of Baltimore filed separate climate change suits against oil and gas companies. But all of these suits are likely to be thrown out. The New York City and the OaklandSan Francisco suits the lawsuits with the highest profile have now been dismissed. As Judge Alsupnotedin his opinion No plaintiff has ever succeeded in bringing a nuisance claim based on global warming. All district or appellate courts are likely to eventually rule that climate change issues are to be decided by the federal government not state and local governments. Its clear that climate lawsuits do notreflectthe will of congressional representatives elected by the American people. In December of 1998 President Bill Clinton signed the Kyoto Protocol a 1997 international treaty signed by 192 nations committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But the US Senate passed a resolution of disapproval with a vote of 95 0 so the treaty was never submitted to the Senate for ratification. Cap and trade legislation was rejected by Congress in 2003 2005 2007 and 2009. Last week the US House of Representativespasseda resolution opposing a carbon tax. While advocates of climate common sense are pleased with the recent court decisions the acceptance that humans are causing dangerous climate change by the oil and gas defendants is very disappointing. Evidenceshowsthat natural factors not emissions from industry dominate global temperatures. Nor are the feared climate disasters happening. Evidenceshowsthat storms droughts or floods are neither more frequent nor more severe than in past decades. Oceans are rising 7 8 inches per century not the 20 feet per centurypredictedby former Vice President Al Gore and others. And the polar bears are doing just fine. A simple example is the question of snow extent. The Boulder Colorado lawsuitallegesthat warming caused by oil companies is reducing the snowpack in Colorado mountains. While some areas have received less snow satellite data from the Rutgers University Global Snow labshowsthat both North American and Northern Hemisphere snow extent has been increasing for the last 40 years. Like most efforts to fight climate change climate lawsuits are a massive waste of taxpayer money.

Global warming activist Greta Thunberg has trolled President Trump after he told the teen to 'chill' and 'work on her anger management problems'. The 16 year old who was named Time magazine's 'Person of The Year' updated her Twitter bio on Thursday to read 'A teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend.' Her bio was a verbatim echo of Trump's tweet about her earlier in the day in which he reacted to news that the publication had awarded the accolade to Thunberg instead of him. 'So ridiculous' the Commander in chief wrote. 'Greta must work on her Anger Management problem then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta Chill!' Thousands of Twitter users rushed to applaud Thunberg after she changed her bio to mock the President. Many praised the teenager for outmaneuvering Trump on Twitter who is widely seen as one of the platform's most skillful and effective users. By lunchtime the hashtag was trending on the social media platform with one popular response reading 'A 16 year old with Asperger's and non native English speaker has better social and communications skills than the current President of the United States. And better Twitter game.' Another wrote 'Interesting how a leader that acts like a child is yelling at a child who acts like a leader'. It's not the first time Thunberg has used her Twitter bio to deftly turn Trump's attacks back around. In September Greta described herself as a 'very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future' after the President sarcastically said of her UN Speech 'She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see.' Meanwhile the President insists he wasn't petty about losing out as Time magazine's person of the year. When asked Wednesday if the White House had a comment about the Commander in chief losing the honor to Thunberg White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley emailed DailyMail.com 'Huh?!?' Thunberg is the magazine's youngest ever Person of the Year a title that still sparks Internet curiosity one day each year despite the steep decline of magazine sales. The teen girl with Asperger's syndrome is the face of the youth climate movement drawing large crowds with her appearances at protests and conferences since last year. Her angry accusations that world leaders are failing the younger generation have made headlines including her shouts of 'How dare you?' during the UN General Assembly this year. An image of her staring at Donald Trump as he entered the UN quickly became a social media meme. Trump has said he doesn't believe global warming is mainly caused by humans. During the 2016 campaign he claimed it was a 'hoax' promoted by China in order to gain economic advantage over the United States. The president has since withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris Climate Treaty. Time editor in chief Edward Felsenthal told the Today show 'She became the biggest voice on the biggest issue facing the planet this year coming from essentially nowhere to lead a worldwide movement.' Politicians have mostly praised Thunberg and her movement as an important voice of her generation. Former Vice President Al Gore said Wednesday 'Brilliant decision for to choose as its Person of the Year. 'Greta embodies the moral authority of the youth activist movement demanding that we act immediately to solve the climate crisis. She is an inspiration to me and to people across the world' Gore said. Felsenthal said Thunberg 'represents a broader generational shift in the culture' adding 'She embodies youth activism.' The magazine says 'In the 16 months since she has addressed heads of state at the U.N. met with the Pope sparred with the President of the United States and inspired 4 million people to join the global climate strike on September 20 2019 in what was the largest climate demonstration in human history.' 'For sounding the alarm about humanity's predatory relationship with the only home we have for bringing to a fragmented world a voice that transcends backgrounds and borders for showing us all what it might look like when a new generation leads Greta Thunberg is TIME's 2019 Person of the Year' the media franchise said Wednesday on its website.

Proponents of the theory humans are primarily responsible for rising global temperatures long claimed wildlife are harmed significantly by global warming and that unless mankind stops producing significant amounts of carbon dioxide emissions the worlds animals will not be able to thrive. While rising temperatures have certainly put a strain on species in some parts of the world a new study by researchers at the University of Southern Denmark suggests animals in the Arctic region are thriving as because of higher global temperatures. According to a press release touting the studys new findings warmer conditions have produced a larger number of life sustaining melt ponds in Arctic waters. Melt ponds provide more light and heat for the ice and the underlying water but now it turns out that they may also have a more direct and potentially important influence on life in the Arctic waters stated the press release. Mats of algae and bacteria can evolve in the melt ponds which can provide food for marine creatures. This is the conclusion of researchers in the periodical Polar Biology the press release said. The researchers said nutrients are able to reach sea creatures in the Arctic more easily because of the melt ponds. Climate change is accompanies by more storms and more precipitation and we must expect that more nutrients will be released from the surroundings into the melt ponds said Professor Ronnie Glud of the Department of Biology at SDU. These conditions plus the fact that the distribution of areas of melt ponds is increasing can contribute to increased productivity in plant and animal life in the Arctic seas. Recent data released by scientists at NASA and the National Snow and Ice Data Center reveals sea ice in the Arctic and Antarctic regions are at their lowest recorded point since 1979 when satellite data first started estimating sea ice. About 2 million square km of Arctic sea ice are estimated to have been lost since 1979. Current data suggest about 14.28 million square km of sea ice remain. USA Today recently declared the loss of sea ice terrifying but global warming skeptics have long suggested these claims are overblown when put into perspective. As reported by Anthony Watts on his influential climate change website Watts Up With That the president of the Royal Society in London reported in 1817 significant reductions to arctic sea ice. It will without doubt have come to your Lordships knowledge that a considerable change of climate inexplicable at present to us must have taken place in the Circumpolar Regions by which the severity of the cold that has for centuries past enclosed the seas in the high northern latitudes in an impenetrable barrier of ice has been during the last two years greatly abated. this affords ample proof that new sources of warmth have been opened and give us leave to hope that the Arctic Seas may at this time be more accessible than they have been for centuries past and that discoveries may now be made in them not only interesting to the advancement of science but also to the future intercourse of mankind and the commerce of distant nations.

TIME listed Greta Thunberg a 16 year old climate change activist on its list of the 100 most influential people of 2019. Thunberg who says she has Asperger syndrome gained prominence for ditching school every Friday to protest outside Swedish parliament. The teenager warned in a high profile speech to the United Nations last year that we need to keep the fossil fuels in the ground or face catastrophe. Thousands of students in Europe and the U.S. ditched school to demand government action on climate change in February. American student activists led by the daughter of Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar demanded a Green New Deal the legislation sponsored by New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. Greta Thunberg saw her power in us and we in turn see our power in her March for Our Lives co founder Emma Gonzlez wrote of Thunberg for TIME adding that Greta is inspiring steadfast students and shaming apathetic adults. Climate change is our reality and youth activists like Greta are doing everything within their power to work against it and demand a change Gonzlez wrote. Thunbergs prominence has only grown as has the alarm of her message. Thunberg even met with Pope Francis who issued an encyclical on global warming in 2015. RELATED Another Canadian Province Boots Liberals Out Of Power Over Carbon Taxes Environmentalists even some climate scientists are increasingly promoting Thunbergs actions in an effort to draw more young people into climate activism. European politicians invited Thunberg to bring her call for urgent action on global warming to lawmakers. I want you to act as if the house was on fire Thunberg said in a speech to European Parliament Tuesday. We are in the middle of the sixth mass extinction and the extinction rate is 10000 times faster than what is considered normal with up to 200 species becoming extinct every single day said a teary eyed Thunberg. Erosion of fertile topsoil deforestation of the rainforest toxic air pollution loss of insects and wildlife acidification of our oceans these are all disastrous trends said Thunberg barely able to keep her tears back.

The United States of America has disproportionately contributed to the climate and ecological crises and to preventing a transition away from fossil fuels and Americans thus bear an extraordinary responsibility to solve the crises the text reads. Apparently the six million Jews massacred during the Second World War not to mention the other tens of millions of casualties do not measure up to the overarching evils of climate changeat least in the minds of the Berkeley City Council. Droughts famines and diseases produced by global warming have already killed millions of people in the Global South the document announces adding that the earth is already too hot for safety and justice. The global economys overshoot of ecological limits and increasingly climate change are driving a global fresh water scarcity crisis and the sixth mass extinction of species which could devastate much of life on earth for the next ten million years the resolution warns. To read through the text one would think that global warming has been behind every catastrophe and uprising on the planet. Climate change has been linked to the Syrian War the rise of Boko Haram in Nigeria as well as the famines water shortages and resulting conflict in Yemen Somalia and South Sudan the document pronounces. Not only present evils however but future calamities are also prophesied with astounding exactitude and certainty. The collapse of the Greenland Ice Shelf the resolution states could result in several billion climate refugees or a substantial share of the entire population of the world. Climate change population growth and growing demand for food energy and fresh water will incite violent conflict over diminishing resources by the year 2030 the document also forecasts with remarkable confidence. The antidote to the Councils doomsday predictions are to take the world back to pre industrial levels of CO2 emissions the text declares conjuring images of bearded Amish people driving about in horse drawn carriages. Humanity must restore a safe level of greenhouse gas concentrations and global average temperatures well below todays levels and back to pre industrial levels as quickly as possible it states. Despite the Councils dire warnings however it turns out that scientists themselves are far less certain that Berkeleys elite council members. For instance only 22 percent of the 1862 American Meteorological Society AMS members surveyed in 2008 believe that all or a large amount of the damage caused by global warming could be prevented by taking measures to mitigate its effects. Moreover the correlation between carbon dioxide emissions and climate warming seems anything but linear. Between 2002 and 2008 CO2 emissions increased from 24 billion tons to 29 billion. In that same period the global temperature anomaly decreased from 0.62C to 0.52C. This fuzzy correlation between CO2 emissions and increase in global temperature raises the question of just what effect a radical decrease of carbon dioxide emissions would actually have on the planet. Not content with prescribing a drastic cutback in global emissions however the Council members forge onward to make a more insidious proposal population control. The Council argues in favor of finding ways to humanely stabilize population as a means of mitigating the effects of global warming. The City of Berkeley calls on the United States of America to initiate a just national mobilization emergency effort to reverse global warming which ends national greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible and immediately initiates an effort to safely draw down carbon from the atmosphere the text boldly proposes. While one can only have pity on local residents who must live under the heavy boot of the unhinged Berkeley City Council the rest of the nation can offer a collective sigh of relief that their power extends no further.

Four Christian church leaders in Montana are urging their states Republican senator to quit rejecting the widely accepted science behind man made global warming. The one Catholic priest and three Protestant clergy criticized Sen. Steve Daines R Mont. inan op edpublished by the Missoulian Thursday for failing to understand climate changes role in a widespread fish kill in Yellowstone National Park last summer. We cannot remain silent while a U.S. senator from Montana chooses willful ignorance of the greatest threat this state has ever faced and which is already causing extreme damage to our cherished Montana environment said the church leaders the Reverends Amy Carter and Laura Folkwein of the United Church of Christ in Missoula the Reverend Susan Barnes of the St. Andrew Presbyterian Church in Billings and Father Robert Grosch of the nearby St. Patrick Co Cathedral. The simple moral truth is that United States is by far the worlds largest historic contributor to the climate crisis and therefore bears the greatest responsibility for addressing it they added. The church leaders slammed Daines for having the audacity to challenge the overwhelming scientific consensus that emissions from farms and burning fossil fuels are trapping heat in the atmosphere and causing the planet to warm. Not unlike the years of public skepticism over smokings role in lung cancermany people still doubt the science behind global warming thanks to a decades long campaign to seed doubt funded by companies with money at stake. Daines who earned a bachelors degree in chemical engineering before entering politics received a paltry 3 percent lifetime score from the League of Conservation Voters which ranks lawmakers by how they vote on environmental legislation. He did however earn a 16 percent score for last year. In 2012 he told Montana Public Radio he believes the climate is changing but doubts how much humans are effecting it. We view science as a way to deepen our appreciation and wonder at the majesty of Gods creation including the complex beautiful and life sustaining planet earth.	False	True	True	False	False
The Sierra Club distributed a press release on Wednesday announcing it had received the 64 million donation to support its Beyond Coal campaign and other organizations with the same ideology that would like to put all coal operations out of business and the American workers who depend on them out of work. Thepress release stated Pollution from coal fired power plants is the largest source of carbon emissions and kills 7500 Americans annually down from 13000 when the Beyond Coal campaign began expanding in 2011 through support from Bloomberg. To date Bloomberg has invested over 100 million in protecting the environment and public health through its support of the Beyond Coal campaign. Since 2011 when Bloomberg Philanthropies first partnered with the Sierra Clubs Beyond Coal Campaign nearly 50 percent of the countrys coal fired power plants have announced their retirement and deaths related to coal pollution have decreased by 42. The press release said the new funding will be used to maintain progress despite the fate of the Clean Power Plan. The Trump administration has yet to realize that the war on coal was never led by Washingtonand Washington cannot end it Bloomberg said in the press release. It was started and continues to be led by communities in both red and blue states who are tired of having their air and water poisoned when there are cleaner and cheaper alternatives available cities and states that are determined to clean their air and reduce their costs and businesses seeking to lower their energy bills while also doing their part for the climate. Without any federal regulations on carbon emissions those groups have combined with market forces to close half the nations coal fired power plants over the past six yearsand with this new grant we aim to reach 60 percent by the end of 2020 Bloomberg said. Michael Brune executive director of the Sierra Club boasted that his organization and other activists are responsible for the closure of scores of dirty power plants. Together we have worked with local grassroots activists and partners in the nations most vulnerable communities to secure the retirement of 259 dirty power plants and the promise of a brighter future putting at the center of our work a transition that leaves no one behind and that demands good paying family sustaining jobs for workers who depended on the fossil fuel economy Brune said. All of this and were just getting started. Our movement is growing and our momentum is unstoppable. Our clean energy future is now. President Trumpsignedan executive order in March ordering a review of the Clean Power Plan as well as other environmental regulations. Instead of Obamas stifling energy regulations the Trump administration will promote policies thatfavorAmerican energy dominance. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt who was one of the first Attorneys General to sue the EPA over the Clean Power Plan is now undertaking the repeal of the Obama era clean energy power grab.

Energy Secretary Rick Perry attended a March 29 event about the state of U.S. energy where he discussed his thoughts on energy policy with Carl Cannon the Washington bureau chief of RealClearPolitics. Here are four checks on claims from the interview. Claim 1 Solar grew by 90 percent in the last two years. So were seeing this really great growth in these renewables claimed Perry. The solar energy sector has grown dramatically in recent years. Technological innovation as well as economies of scale have made solar a viable technology. The price of crystalline silicon solar modules for example have dropped dramatically falling from 79 per watt in 1976 2018 dollars to 0.27 per watt according to BloombergNEF. In terms of electricity generation the extent of that growth depends on the type of solar panels counted and whether small scale facilities are included. Looking at photovoltaic solar panels the dominant type of solar technology the U.S. generated on net nearly 33 million megawatt hours MWh at utility scale facilities in 2016 rising 90 percent to 63 million MWh in 2018 according to the Energy Information Administration EIA. When including electricity generated from a second form of solar technology known as solar thermal the percent change drops slightly to 85 percent. These figures only represent the electricity generated at utility scale facilities which are 1 MW or larger in size. The percentage drops further to 75 percent when including net electricity generation from small scale facilities. The EIAs Monthly Energy Review for March reports an 85 percent increase for solar electricity 36.1 million net kilowatt hours kWh generated in 2016 compared to 66.6 million kWh in 2018. Claim 2 When I was governor of Texas we put more wind energy in than any other state in the nation said Perry. Perry served as governor of Texas from December 2000 to January 2015 making him the longest serving governor in Texas history. During that time the state experienced a boom in wind energy. From 2000 to 2014 the amount of net electricity generated from wind power grew from 492000 MWh a year to just over 40 million a year an 8029 percent increase according to EIA data. No other state experienced the same level of growth over this period. Iowa was the next closest generating an additional 15.8 million MWh from wind. The same can be said when measuring growth by installed wind capacity. Texas added nearly 14000 megawatts MW of capacity from 2000 to 2014 according to the Energy Departments DOE WindExchange website far more than the 5446 MW that Iowa added over the same period. Perry helped spur investment in wind energy when he signed a 2005 bill that required Texas to dramatically increase its renewable energy capacity over the following decade. He also threw his support behind a 7 billion electrical transmission project to send renewable energy to communities across the state. Claim 3 From 2005 to 2017 this country has reduced emissions by 14 percent claimed Perry. In 2017 the U.S. emitted 5.1 billion metric tons of energy related carbon dioxide according to EIA data. This represents a 1 percent decrease from the previous year and a 14 percent decrease since 2005. Weighted by global warming potential carbon dioxide emissions accounted for 82 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 according to a report from the Environmental Protection Agency. Gross greenhouse emissions fell from 7.3 billion metric tons in 2005 to 6.5 billion in 2017 a 12 percent reduction. Claim 4 When I first met you you were running for president the Department of Energy was one of the federal agencies that you thought was maybe extraneous said Cannon. In 2011 Perry ran for president as a Republican. During one presidential debate he said that he would abolish three federal agencies if elected naming the Commerce and Education Departments but infamously forgetting the third. He later clarified that the third agency was the DOE telling reporters Everybody tomorrow will understand the Energy Department is one of those that needs to be done away with. President Donald Trump announced that he would nominate Perryto serve as energy secretary in December 2016.

So does that mean paper bags which degrade more easily are a better option? Not necessarily. Climate change has become the biggest environmental issue of our time so its worth looking at things from an emissions standpoint. And on that score paper bags fare worse. Even though paper bags are made from trees which are in theory a renewable resource it takes significantly more energy to create pulp and manufacture a paper bag than it does to make a single use plastic bag from oil. Back in 2011 Britains Environment Agency conducted a life cycle assessment of various bag options looking at every step of the production process. The conclusion? Youd have to reuse a paper bag at least three times before its environmental impact equaled that of a high density polyethylene plastic bag used only once. And if plastic bags were reused repeatedly they looked even better. Paper bags can more easily be recycled or even composted bu t the British study found that even these actions didnt make a huge difference in the broader analysis. Unless youre reusing your paper bags a lot they look like a poorer option from a global warming standpoint. That same British analysis also looked into reusable options like heavier more durable plastic bags or cotton bags. And it found that these are only sustainable options if you use them very frequently. Making a cotton shopping bag is hardly cost free. Growing cotton requires a fair bit of energy land fertilizer and pesticides which can have all sorts of environmental effects from greenhouse gas emissions to nitrogen pollution in waterways.

This story was originally published bytheGuardian. It appears here as part of theClimate Deskcollaboration. When I was a ranger at Crater Lake national park in the 1980s the average snowfall at headquarters was 500 inches a year and snow could accumulate at 2 inches an hour. One of my jobs as ranger was to shovel out the fire hydrants every day so that if there was a fire in the hotel headquarters or housing wed be able to fight it. Our maintenance staff plowed roads for safe visitor access and rangers patrolled on skis regularly performing rescues. This was all part of ensuring that in accordance with the National Park Services founding charter the parks are unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations. Leaving the parks open without these essential staff is equivalent to leaving the Smithsonian museums open without any staff to protect the priceless artifacts. Yet as a result of the government shutdown which furloughed most park staff this is what has happened. It is a violation of the stewardship mandate motivated only by politics. While the majority of the public will be respectful there will always be a few who take advantage of the opportunity to do lasting damage. In 2016 the NPS hosted 320 million visitors more than all of the Disney parks major league baseball football basketball soccer and Nascar combined. Many of our national parks operate much like a small city with the National Park Service employees providing all the same services trash collection police and fire response water and sewer systems electrical power bus service and parking management. The national parks differ from a city in that they are also designed to protect some of the United States most precious resources such as the Merced River of Yosemite Valley the elk and bison of Yellowstone and the iconic Lincoln Memorial. When Congress and the executive branches of government failed to appropriate funding in 1998 and 2013 the government shut down for extended periods and the national parks were closed to the public. The logic was that if the employees were furloughed and could not perform their stewardship and safety responsibilities then the only way to meet the requirements of unimpaired was to close the parks. During the 16 day shutdown of 2013 the closure of the national parks became the public face of the shutdown with thousands of articles in the press and recurring images of gates and park closure signs. There was enormous political pressure to reopen the parks culminating in a Republican House joint hearing where I as the NPS director was grilled for five hours over the decision to close the parks during the shutdown. Though unintended the closure of the national parks became a rallying cry for the public to force Congress to finally pass appropriation legislation and reopen the federal government. This time surely to avoid the public outcry theTrump administration decided to keep the national parks open while still furloughing the majority of the NPS staff. As the shutdown extends and the parks are left open we will begin to see the ugly consequences. Trash is already accumulating in parks such as Yosemite and will attract wildlife. This could result in tragic humanbear encounters or habituate bears to human food meaning the animals will have to be relocated or euthanized in the future. Civil war battlefield parks are seeing increases in artifact theft by people with metal detectors. Human waste has overwhelmed toilets at Joshua Tree and Point Reyes and has proliferated along trails rivers and streams potentially affecting water quality and certainly the visitor experience. Roads normally open in Mt. Rainier and Crater Lake national parks are accumulating so much snow that they will have to be bulldozed to reopenat a much higher expense and with prolonged delays. Visitor centers are closed across the parks depriving visitors of information on hazardous conditions trail closures and wildlife activity. Wildlife normally fully protected will be subject to poaching or threats such as the recent break in at the endangered Devils Hole pupfish enclosure in Nevada. Visitors to parks are reporting dogs off leash drone activity off highway vehicles and the public walking on or near fragile resources such as the hot pools and thermal features of Yellowstone. There are other consequences of a shutdown that are less visible but very consequential. The control of the spread of invasive species into national parks stops allowing some to gain a foothold that will be much harder to control. Long term monitoring sites that measure snow depth rainfall air quality water quality or pollution will go unmaintained. Research scientists working on complex issues that only occur during this period such as pronghorn migration may miss their window. These disruptions of data collection make the results less reliable for understanding ecosystem dynamics or climate change. Author Wallace Stegner once said that National parks are the best idea we ever had. Absolutely American absolutely democratic they reflect us at our best rather than our worst. Now left unattended and gathering trash and human waste the Trump administration has let them reflect us at our worst. Jonathan BJarvis was the 18thdirector of the National Park Service. He is now the executive director for the Institute for Parks People and Biodiversity at the University of California Berkeley.	False	False	False	False	False
Using an approach described by experts as not scientifically sound the Trump administration will soon change the way it evaluates the harm from coal plants spewing more pollution into the air according to a Monday New York Times report. Trump's Environmental Protection Agency EPA is planning to release a new rule to measure the impact of air pollution on health risks. The rules will be favorable to dirty energy producers like the coal industry an industry that Trump's EPA chief Andrew Wheeler used to lobby for. And to allow that to happen experts told the Times the EPA's new rule will simply ignore decades of high quality research and use unfounded medical assumptions to claim that air pollution does less harm to people than peer reviewed scientific data indicates. One result of the new scientifically unsound method would be to magically decrease the 1400 premature deaths that Trump's changes to environmental rules were previously projected to cause. Trump's ultimate goal is to roll back improvements President Obama made that limit the pollution coal plants produce. Obama's rules would have reduced the amount of dangerous particulate matter in the air by gradually moving energy production to cleaner forms of energy and shutting down older dirtier coal plants. Particulate matter is extremely harmful and it leads to a large number of premature deaths Richard Revesz an environmental law expert at New York University told the Times. Trump wants to toss out the Obama era rules with ones that allow older coal plants to stay in business longer and continue risking lives by spewing particulates into the air. The person in charge of air quality at the EPA William Wehrum was a lawyer and lobbyist for the fossil fuel industry before joining the EPA. He admitted to the Times that the new method would allow the Trump administration to claim its other changes would cause fewer deaths. Trump has a long record of anti environment and anti science positions and so do his political appointees. Now those officials are preparing to discard sound scientific methods to pretend that their actions will be less deadly than they really are. Published with permission of The American Independent.

Governor Jerry Brown has expressed an interest in barring the sale of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines Mary Nichols chairman of theCalifornia Air Resources Board said in an interview Friday at Bloomberg headquarters in New York.The earliest such a ban is at least a decade away she said. Brown one of the most outspoken elected official in the U.S. about the need for policies to combat climate change would be replicating similar moves by China France and the U.K. Ive gotten messages from the governor asking Why havent we done something already? Nichols said referring to Chinas planned phase out of fossil fuel vehicle sales. The governor has certainly indicated an interest in why China can do this and not California. To reach the ambitious levels of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions we have to pretty much replace all combustion with some form of renewable energy by 2040 or 2050 Nichols said. Were looking at that as a method of moving this discussion forward. Instituting such a policy in California would affect the entire car industry globally due to the massive size of Californias car market. Over2 million new passenger vehicles were sold and registered in the nations most populous state last year more thanthan the entire nations of Spain France and Italy. California has had the right to write its own pollution rules since the 1970s underwaivers granted by the EPA. But its unlikelythe Trump administration wouldapprove such a plan forcing California to take a different legal route. According to Motor Trendmagazine Nichols saysCalifornia is consideringregulating the types of cars that can be registered in the state or have access to highways. We certainly wouldnt expect to get a waiver for that from the EPA she toldBloomberg. I think we would be looking at using some of our other authorities to get that result. China plans to endsales of combustion enginevehicles in 2030. Other countries like France and the U.K. plan to follow suit a decade later. California has not yet specified a date to copy Chinas policy. Tim Donnellyis a former California State Assemblyman and Author currently on a book tour for his new bookPatriot Not Politician Win or Go Homeless. He also ran for governor in 2014.

The shift in government policy likely will force Musk and his investors to revamp his sprawling business empire which relies on government subsidies and on preferencesfor solar energy over natural fuels. For examplethe Los Angeles Times reported in 2015 thatMusks battery factory in Reno Nevada is reported to have enjoyed roughly 1.3 billion in state subsidies and his SolarCity companyhas gotten 1.5 billion from federal solar regulations. In California the state legislature allowed his Tesla Motors to sell more than 500 million worth of government granted carbon energy credits said the Los Angeles Times and the states anti pollution agency allows theowners of battery operated cars to use low traffic high occupancy lanes in gridlocked Los Angeles. Musks solar energy company in New York state has reportedly gained 1 billion in near term and short term investment from Democratic politicians said the newspaper. However those financial gains for Musk depend on higher energy taxes for the nations established manufacturing sectors especially in Midweststates.Breitbart described the economic impact of the climate agreement Unsurprisingly Musk is a strong advocate for growing carbon taxes on natural fuels. In a January 2017 interview with Gizmodo Musk declared CO2 carbon diooxide isnt exactly pollution but it does cause warming and slight acidification of water if very large quantities are dug from deep underground and added to the surface cycle. The problem is the age old tragedy of the commons. The common good being consumed is atmospheric and oceanic carbon capacity which currently has a price of zero. This results in an error in market signals and far more CO2 is generated than should be. We wont ever go to zero CO2 but the rate over time should be dropped far below what it is today. Start low and increase it until the desired outcome is achieved. This can be offset by a reduction in other taxes like sales tax which is quite regressive. This is analogous to taxing cigarettes and alcohol more than fruits and vegetables which everybody agrees makes sense. We should have higher taxes on the things that science says are probably bad for us than those that are probably good for us. New York investors including Goldman Sachs have made big bets on the preservation of the Paris deal according to The HuffingtonPost.	True	False	False	True	True
President Trump Donald John TrumpSunday shows preview Shutdown negotiations continue after White House immigration proposal Rove warns Senate GOP Don't put only focus on base Ann Coulter blasts Trump shutdown compromise We voted for Trump and got Jeb! MOREin an early morning tweet on Sunday suggested global warming could be helpful as a massive snowstorm dropped several inches of snow and sent temperatures plunging across the Midwest and swaths of the Northeast United States. Be careful and try staying in your house Trump advised. Large parts of the Country are suffering from tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold. Amazing how big this system is. Wouldnt be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now! The president who hasrepeatedly cast doubt on the existence and effects of climate change has regularly cited significant winter storms to mock the concept of global warming. He sent similar tweets in 2017 and 2011. The current winter storm prompted the governor of Kansas to declare a state of emergency canceled thousands of flights and dumped more than a foot of snow across most of upstate New York. Falling temperatures were expected to create icy surfaces further increasing the risk of travel. Trump and others who deny climate change have cited cold temperatures and winter storms to dismiss global warming but experts have noted there is a difference between the climate and weather. A government report issued late last yearconcluded that climate change could cost the United States billions of dollars annually within decades if greenhouse gases arent dramatically reduced and could worsen environmental disasters like wildfires and flooding. Its findings aligned with those of the broader scientific community. The study mandated to be released every four years under the National Climate Assessment from the multiagency Global Change Research Program was conducted by hundreds of government and external scientists. Trump dismissedthe report saying he did not believe its findings and disputing that climate change is man made.	True	True	True	True	False
Mark Miller of Pacific Legal Foundation an anti regulation law group that has won 10 out of 12 Supreme Court cases it has pursued told BuzzFeed News it is too soon to tell exactly how a replacement for Kennedy would change environmental law. You couldnt predict how Justice Kennedy was going to decide things over his thirty some years. Reliably hard to predict Kennedy was more interested in nuanced and scientific arguments than some of the more conservative judges with a stricter anti regulation outlook David Doniger of the Natural Resources Defense Council told BuzzFeed News. Clearly over the years he has been in a different spot from the other judges. Trump has said he will choose Kennedys replacement from a short list of 25 candidates . If that holds true the new court will likely be harder to convince of the importance of environmental laws. He was a gettable fifth vote on decisions Bookbinder said. Things are more daunting without him. He will be missed David Bookbinder of the Niskanen Center who was the Sierra Clubs chief climate counsel in the 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA decision that designated greenhouse gasses as pollution under the Clean Air Act. But during his 30 year tenure Kennedy was also the key vote on fundamental environmental decisions. Environmental lawyers are worried about tough times ahead for new laws restricting pollution and protecting wildlife. Kennedy announced his retirement Wednesday prompting an immediate political scramble over his successor and opening the door for new legal fights on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay marriage. Miller suggested that the Endangered Species Act would be the first environmental issue to take the stage on a Kennedy less court A dispute over the endangered dusky gopher frog Weyerhaeuser v. US Fish and Wildlife Service FWS is now on the courts docket in the fall. That fight is over 1500 acres of forest in Louisiana that the FWS designated as critical habitat for the survival of the species even though the frogs dont live on it. The owners of the forest are challenging the government agencys ability to declare property as critical habitat when a species doesnt live on it as well as the government not taking economic costs into account in making such designations. Further down the road experts expect a fight over which of the nations waterways are actually protected under the Clean Water Act to return to the Supreme Court which sent lawsuits on this issue to district courts in January. Those lawsuits are challenging the Environmental Protection Agencys protection of some streams and waterways under rules narrowly written to conform to a 414 Rapanos v. United States decision made in 2006 where the 1 was Kennedy. The conservative wing of the court wanted to limit EPAs oversight to only big navigable waterways in that case and the liberal justices wanted essentially all small wetlands and streams protected too but Kennedy ended up creating middle ground. He said the government should only be able to regulate smaller waterways that have a significant nexus with major ones. So there was no majority opinion. Because all spaces protected under Kennedys one vote opinion also would be protected under the four liberal justices view however his opinion is the one that effectively controlled decisions going forward. In this case his lone opinion became the law Bookbinder said. Thats how pivotal he was. More lawsuits are expected on this in response to Trumps EPA drafting its own controversial water rule. One area legal experts are split on is whether the 2007 decision that greenhouse gases are pollutants will be reconsidered. Theres a been a lot of focus on whether that case will be reversed by a new majority Joseph Goffman executive director of Harvards Environmental Law Program told BuzzFeed News. While he doesnt dismiss this possibility out of hand hes more concerned by the court incrementally chipping away at the governments authority to regulate climate pollution in other ways. NRDCs Doniger pointed out the landmark decision has been twice reaffirmed by the court. At the same time it had already started to chip away at EPAs power to regulate greenhouse gasses in 2016 by halting enforcement of the Obama administrations Clean Power Plan aimed at curbing emissions from power plants. The Trump administration has since said it was pulling back that plan. Chief Justice John Roberts over the years has not been consistently opposed to environmental regulation or plain readings of pollution laws Doniger added suggesting that environmental plaintiffs in cases may turn their strategy to garnering his vote. And while there were many close cases involving the environment that came to the court during Kennedys 30 years there environmental advocates noted that not all of those cases were close. Its not like every environmental case was decided 54 Doniger said. There are plenty of 63 or 72 cases where environmentally sound decisions in our view were made. So you really cant say the sky is falling.	False	False	False	True	False
A geophysics professor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology says that hes run the numbers on humanity facing a mass extinction event and the numbers are not good. According to Digital Trends a mass extinction eventis an event in which a large number of species become extinct at once as was the case with the death of thedinosaurs65 million years ago. Daniel Rothman told the publication that we are approaching a threshold of catastrophe in the carbon cycle similar to that of the five previous periods of mass extinction over the last 540 million years. The study identifies two thresholds for major carbon cycle changeRothmansaid. One is a critical rate of change corresponding to the rate at which CO2 is added to the oceanatmosphere system. The other a critical size or mass corresponds to the total carbon added to the oceans. Exceeding the critical rate at slow time scales much greater than about 10000 years or exceeding the critical size at fast time scales much less than about 10000 years is associated with mass extinction he explained. The MIT research paper predicts that the critical mass about 300 gigatons of carbon he concluded will likely be exceeded sometime this century. If so following the papers logic the marine carbon cycle would proceed to follow a trajectory which could excite a mass extinction over a period of about 10000 years. Rothman goes on to explain that the tipping point of unknown territory wont take that long he predicts it will come as soon as 2100 or sooner. Rothman says thatdecreasing carbon emissions would be the best way to try to avoid the catastrophe. Those who point to discrepancies in the global warming narrative have also noted that many of the solutions offered by climate change advocates do very little to actually stop carbon emissions and turn back the clock. They also cite previous doomsday scenarios offered by alarmist scientists that didnt come to fruition including acid rain and global cooling.	False	True	False	True	False
AnOregon climate change bill that prompted 12 Republican lawmakers to flee the Statehouse in Salem last weekhas hit yet another snagSenate President Peter Courtney a Democrat announced Tuesday that the chamber did not have enough votes to pass the legislation. The cap and trade program intended to rein in industrial carbon emissions lost traction even with the state's Democratic senators according to Courtney sparking protesters who were initially demanding that Republicans return to the floor for a vote to begin chantingPeter Courtney's got to go. I've done as much as I can and I'll continue to tryCourtney said. RUNAWAY OREGON REPUBLICAN SAYS LAWMAKERS WON'T RETURN TO STATE UNTIL 'EXPENSIVE' CARBON TAX BILL SCRAPPED Gov. Kate Brown also a Democratauthorized the state police to round up the 12 Republicans who walked out of the Statehousein protest of the bill Thursday and bring them back to the Senate floor for a vote but to no avail. If passed the measure would make Oregon the second state in the nation after California to implement such a program. Republicans fled the Senate some even claiming to the leave the state refusing to sign off on a bill that wouldlimit emissions and establishpollution permitsor allowances for each ton of carbon an industry plans to emit. Speaking to Fox Friends from an undisclosed location Tuesday Republican state Sen.Tim Knopp criticizedthe bill and insistedthat he and his GOP colleagues would continue to stymie the state legislative process which requires20 members in the Senate in order to constitute as a quorum in order to proceed unless the carbon tax is scrapped and a bipartisan solution is reached. The bill would limit greenhouse gas emissions and auction pollution allowances for carbon that businesses want to emit with a lowering cap. The bill would reduce emissions to 45 percent below 1990 levels by 2035 and 80 percent by 2050. Critics say it would hurt the business community and exacerbate a divide between liberalurban areas and conservative rural parts of the state. All we're saying is it shouldn't cost thousands of manufacturing jobs raise the gas tax by 20 cents a gallon to start out with and raise natural gas prices for people who heat their home by almost 50 percent. We think there's a better way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and so were holding out Knopp said. And the only way we could do that and stop this vote is by not providing a quorum for Democrats to roll over us..

In January Californias Jerry Brown became the first governor in the states history to declare a state of emergency for a drought and a flood simultaneously. On Friday Brown lifted the drought emergency in all but four counties Fresno Kings Tulare and Tuolumne counties. But rather than lift the burdensome water regulations implemented to cope with the drought he announced that many of those regulations would remain intact even though the flood emergency remains. Browns latest plan Making Water Conservation a California Way of Life allows the state to oversee conservation goals it sets in urban water management agencies as well as to permanently prohibit activities it deems wasteful of the water supply. It also creates more stringent standards for establishing these water use goals. Brown has indicated that he hopes to expand the states water supply with new sources of water but his focus on making conservation a way of life in a time when Californias streets are flooding suggests otherwise. Certainly Californians and everyone else ought to find ways to responsibly use natural resources such as water. Mandating conservation however is drastically different from incentivizing it. Even though there is no longer a drought state of emergency in their state Californians will be fined if they wash their automobiles with hoses not equipped with a shut off nozzle water lawns in a way that results in water run off or hose off sidewalks. The plan also gives urban government agencies until 2025 to comply with their conservation targets limiting the water usage of Californians. But water conservation can only go so far. California ought to begin expanding its water supply rather than incessantly regulate how citizens use water especially now that the governor doesnt retain the broad powers spelled out under the drought state of emergency Browns flood state of emergency doesnt give him the same power to regulate water use. John Woodling of the Sacramento Regional Water Authority told the Sacramento Bee that Browns assertion of state power in this area will give it permanent unchecked control over local water management decisions. And as Browns plan begins to drive water consumption down Woodling said it could hurt the economy. Governor Brown has pushed two contradictory agendas for months. Now even he has concluded that California is no longer in a drought. Its time for these conservation regulations to be lifted and for the state to do what it should have done a long time ago look to expand its water supply.	True	True	False	False	True
A little over a year agoI wrote that President Trump saved the planetwhen he pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement. The decision I argued enabled the free market to do exactly what liberals want Empower individuals to better the environment without government intervention. As individuals we are taking steps to protect the environment by choice not by mandate and going green is paying off. According to the Energy Information Administrations EIA latest monthly energy report U.S. carbon dioxide emissions are at their lowest point since 1992. Per capita carbon emissions are the lowest theyve been since 1950. Were also outpacing our allies many of whom criticized President Trumps decision to put America first. In the last year alone U.S. carbon emissions fell more than 0.5 percent while European emissionsrose 1.5 percent. Its the height of irony given Europes virtue signaling last year. After President Trump shredded his predecessors unconstitutional treaty the globalist leaders of France Germany and Italyclaimedit cannot be renegotiated. They referred to the irreversible agreement as a vital instrument for our planet societies and economies. The globalist decree would have left us spending trillions of dollars a year to mitigate a rise in global temperatures without really mitigating it at all. The Paris climate agreement was expected to drop temperatures byone fifth of a degreeover the next century. Apparently it wasnt such a vital instrument after all. Europe is failing to pull its weight as Americanscut pollution to historic lows. The decline in U.S. carbon emissions is a testament to the free markets enduring power. There is nothing more vital for environmental protection than our freedom to protect the environment as individuals without Big Government and its endless red tape. Anti Trump liberals and conservatives alike are investing in renewable energy choosing hybrid vehicles over gas guzzlers and encouraging their neighbors to do the same. Were cutting down on waste like never before. Were reusing more than ever. And were recycling recycling recycling. This year the environmental industry is expected togrow five percent to 407 billion without the Paris agreement. By 2020 the waste management segment alone is projected to surpass 70 billion in economic activity with an average annual growth rate of 3.6 percent. Corporate America is doing its part. Tesla is working on theworlds largest battery farmin the California desert reaffirming its commitment to electric vehicles and an energy grid powered by renewable options. The new power plant will be capable of producing up to 1.1 GWh of electricity enough energy for millions of homes. Tesla isnt alone. Last year 19 companiesannounced deals with energy providersto build 2.78 gigawatts worth of solar and wind generating capacity. At least 22 companies in the Fortune 500 have committed to buying enough renewable energy to match 100 percent of their electricity use moving forward. Earlier this year oil and gas companies such as ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shellmet with Pope Francisto discuss climate change and put concrete solutions on the table. Theyrebacking up their words ExxonMobil is developing renewable oils from genetically engineered algae while Royal Dutch Shell vows to become a leading supplier of renewable electricity. Going green is creating new jobs and new industries to boot. As always free market forces outperform the unfunded mandates and taxpayer funded job killing enforcement bureaucracies of Big Government. Even as the Left demands more environmental regulations President Trump is wise to side with the free market. When individuals are free to choose when and how to adjust their daily lives to protect the environment without government compulsion requiring it the environment reaps the benefits. When private enterprise is free to experiment and innovate we see a stronger economy and a real commitment to environmental action. President Trump understands environmental protection is impossible without individual action and private innovation. Its because of free enterprise the environmental industry is as large as it is todayand growing. By protecting individual freedom from government regulation President Trump is saving our jobs and the environment to boot.

Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortezs newly released Green New Deal resolution has gotten a lot of attention for its 100 percent renewable energy goal but the bill also vaguely references another source of emissions. The resolution calls for aWorld War II style mobilization effort to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural operations. If thats the case that means any subsequent Green New Deal legislation would have to deal with a major source of methane emissions cow flatulence and burps. We set a goal to get to net zero rather than zero emissions in 10 years because we arent sure that well be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast reads the initial version of the resolutions fact sheet. However Ocasio Cortez staffers have since removed farting from fact sheet. Methane makes up 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions that scientists blame for global warming. Enteric fermentation the digestive process in cows and other ruminant animals is the largest source of U.S. methane emissions according to Environmental Protection Agency EPA data. EPA says cattle account for the majority of methane emissions in the United States for this source category referring to emissions from enteric fermentation.Most methane from cows comes from their burps not farts.RELATED Alexandria Ocasio Cortez Green New Deal Is About Social Justice Being a non binding resolution the Green New Deal doesnt offer any specifics on how livestock emissions would be phased down or eliminated. The question then becomes How do you eliminate emissions from cows sheep and other animals? Certainly environmental groups have increasingly called for getting beef out of peoples diets in the name of the climate but there are legitimate worries doing so would be a net negative on overall public health. Some scientists have looked into reducing flatulence from ruminant animals. The U.S. government funded a 2014 study to find out why some types of sheep burped and farted more than others. The Obama administration released a plan to clamp down on methane emissions in 2014 which included programs to cut emissions from dairy operations. Republican lawmakers worried the Obama era effort could have resulted in new regulations or taxes on farmers. Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide but makes up a much smaller slice of Americas emissions profile. Natural gas systems and landfills also emit methane which Democrats and environmentalists want to regulate more.

The actions of mankind could lead to the extinction of half of African birds and mammals by the end of 2100 a UN backed study has said. The report conducted by 550 experts from around the world said reduced biodiversity could affect people's quality of life. It also found 42 of land based animal and plant species in Europe and Central Asia have declined in the last decade. The findings come after the death of the last male northern white rhino. Despite the bleak findings the study also pointed to some successes in reversing declines in wildlife. The study by the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services IPBES showed forest cover in China and other parts of north east Asia had risen by more than 20 between 1990 and 2015. It also found that animals such as the amur leopard which were once on the verge of the extinction had grown in population. Speaking at the 2018 Biodiversity Summit in Colombia leading British scientist Sir Robert Watson said We must act to halt and reverse the unsustainable use of nature or risk the future we want and have. Fortunately the evidence also shows that we know how to protect and partially restore our vital natural assets. Academic volunteers looked through some 10000 scientific publications for what is said to be the most extensive biodiversity survey since 2005. Among the list of the biggest threats to food and water security were pollution climate change and deforestation. Scientists say governments businesses and individuals must consider the impact on biodiversity when taking decisions on farming fishing forestry mining or infrastructure development.

A fifth generation coal miner from Virginia has spoken out against President Donald Trump's rhetoric surrounding the coal mining industry saying the President is making false promises that are only going to line the pockets of coal executives. In a New York Times op ed video published Tuesday Nick Mullins a ninth generation Appalachian from Virginia said that if Trump wants to help the Appalachian mining communities that support him lowering emission standards is not the way to do it. At this year's State of the Union address Trump talked about ending the war on beautiful clean coal. Mullins says coal cannot be clean and that miners know firsthand. We have to realize that the environmental impacts of the industry aren't a partisan issue he said. They're a matter of life or death. On Tuesday the newly proposed Affordable Clean Energy Rule was announced which would allow states to set their own emission standards for coal fueled power plants. Throughout his campaign and presidency Trump has lauded his plan to replace the Obama administration's climate change policies with rules and regulations that would be more friendly toward the coal industry. The Obama administration's Clean Power Plan made greenhouse gas emissions federally regulated for the first time.	True	False	False	True	True
Teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg has already caused a sensation on her trip to North America tearing into world leaders yesterday in an emotional speech at the United Nations and giving a death stare to Donald Trump. What is not yet clear is how the 16 year old will get back to Sweden because she refuses to travel on fuel guzzling planes and the 60ft racing boat she travelled on is already back in Europe. Two crew members have flown to the U.S. to sail the Malizia II back across the Atlantic and it is not yet clear exactly when Thunberg will be going home. When she set off from Britain last month she admitted 'I don't know yet how I will get home'. Non stop flights from London to New York City take between eight to ten hours for a 3470 mile journey. It equates to about 183910 pounds of emissions per flight between the two cities and Thunberg refuses to add to the environmental cost. She has also persuaded her parents to stop flying hampering her mother's career as an international opera singer. 'My generation wont be able to fly other than for emergencies in a foreseeable future if we are to be the least bit serious' about limiting global warming she has previously said. Thunberg also refuses to travel aboard a cruise ship as they are also notoriously big polluters. The Malizia II is now back in France after sailing back from New York without Thunberg. Unless the Malizia II returns to North America she will have to find a different mode of transport back across the Atlantic when she eventually leaves. In the meantime she plans to promote her climate agenda across North America. This week she will travel from New York to Montreal to join a school climate strike in Canada on what is expected to be a day of global protests. She also hopes to visit Mexico and is due in Chile for a climate summit in December travelling across the Americasby bus and train. The 16 year old is taking a year out of school to lobby for climate action after starting the school strike movement in Sweden last August. She skipped school for the first three weeks after term began and then took Fridays off to spend the day outside Sweden's parliament with a sign labelled 'School strike for climate'. Her protests have inspired wealthy donors to contribute to a Climate Emergency Fund to support the protests and the simultaneous Extinction Rebellion movement. Its donors include heiress Aileen Getty American philanthropist Trevor Neilson and filmmaker Rory Kennedy a member of the political Kennedy clan. The Swedish teenager named this week's UN Climate Action Summit and the Chile conference in December as her main reasons for crossing the Atlantic. She said last year she had beeninvited to speak around the world but refused to make the necessary flights. But in June she said 'it looks like a large part of our future will probably be decided in New York and Santiago' and agreed to travel to North America on the yacht. Pierre Casiraghi the grandson of Monaco's late Prince Rainier III and American actress Grace Kelly and fellow yachtsman Boris Herrmann offered her passage on the Malizia II. She arrived last month after a two week journey aboard the racing yacht. Thunberg documented parts of her journey on Twitter where she included videos of choppy weather conditions photos of herself and the crew and commentaries about climate change. Last week she joined a school strike in New York City where school officials allowed pupils the day off to attend the protest. In her impassioned address yesterday she said 'This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here.I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. 'Yet you have come to us young people for hope. How dare you?'You have stolen my dreams my childhood with your empty words. 'Yet I'm one of the lucky ones. People are suffering people are dying entire ecosystems are collapsing and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?' 'The eyes of future generations are on you and if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this.' Trump sent a mocking tweet saying 'She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So nice to see!' Fewer than half the 136 heads of government or state in New York this week to attend the UN General Assembly attended on Monday. Ahead of the conference the United Nations issued a release saying 66 countries vowed to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 along with 10 regions 102 cities and scores of businesses.

wikimedia commons Its now inevitable that the contiguous United States will lose all of its glaciers within a matter of decades according to scientists who have revealed the precipitous shrinkage of dozens of glaciers in Montana. Warming temperatures have rapidly reduced the size of 39 named glaciers in Montana since 1966 according to comparisons released by the US Geological Survey USGS and Portland State University. Some have lost as much as 85 of their expanse over the past 50 years with Glacier national park site of 37 of the surveyed glaciers set to lose all of its eponymous ice formations within the next few decades. Of the 150 glaciers that existed in the park in the late 19th century only 26 remain. The disappearance of glaciers in Montana is part of a broader loss that will see all glaciers defined as moving bodies of snow and ice larger than 25 acres largely vanish from the lower 48 states of America by the mid point of the century according to Dr Daniel Farge lead USGS scientist. Its inevitable that we will lose them all over the next few decades Farge said. The Colorado glaciers started melting before Montanas and while there are larger glaciers in the Pacific north west that will hold on longer the number vanishing will steadily grow until none are left. Andrew Fountain a geologist at Portland State added While the shrinkage in Montana is more severe than some other places in the US it is in line with trends that have been happening on a global scale. Rising temperatures Montana is warming nearly twice as quickly as the global average and changes in precipitation patterns are eroding away glaciers in the state and elsewhere along the Rocky mountains. Last year scientists in Colorado found that the Arikaree glacier which is likely more than 1000 years old has been thinning by around a metre 3.2ft a year over the past decade and will vanish within 25 years.

This story was originally published byHuffPostand appears here as part of theClimate Deskcollaboration. The Evergreen States third and latest attempt to put a price on climate pollution failed Tuesday as voters rejected the historic ballot measure notching yet another win for the oil and gas industry. The measure known as Initiative 1631 aimed to put a levy of 15 per metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions starting in January 2020. The fee would have increased 2 annually until the state met its goals for cutting heat trapping gas pollution. The revenue was designed to be directed toward projects accelerating the states shift away from fossil fuels including expanding public transit energy efficiency retrofits for big buildings and new wind and solar powered plants. Washington already tried to pass more traditional carbon taxes. In November 2016 voters rejected a proposal for a tax of 25 per metric ton of carbon dioxide which aimed to cut the state sales tax 1 percent fund a tax credit of up to 1500 for low income households and cut the tax rate for manufacturers. In March a bill to enact a carbon tax escalating 1.80 per ton each year until hitting 30 in 2031 failed in the state Senate when it fell one or two votes short prompting the sponsor to pull the legislation. But Initiative 1631 took a different approach imposing the carbon price in the form of a fee. Under Washington State law a feeas opposed to a taxcannot be spent on government expenses such as public education or welfare meaning all the revenue the fee raises must fund climate related projects. That put it more in line with the Green New Deal a term progressive activists coined to describe a set of proposals for major government spending plans to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Scientists say such policies are necessary to make the kinds of emissions cuts required to avert the worst impacts of climate change. Just last month a sobering United Nations report found that world government must halve global emissions over the next 12 years to avoid cataclysmic warming and that technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere are still likely necessary. Yet fears over rising gas prices proved more convincing to Evergreen State voters. The Western States Petroleum Association raised over 31 milliona record for Washington ballot initiativesfor its No campaign spending nearly 30 million of it by the start of this month. The campaign dispensed 10.8 million in the last two weeks of October alone. The loss came as Coloradans voted down Proposition 112 a measure that would have put about 85 percent of non federal land in the Centennial State off limits to oil and gas drilling.

Air pollution is not just bad for health also makes people unhappy a new study has shown. Researchers at MIT and the University of Beijing discovered a direct link between the amount of particulates in the air and happiness. Research has previously shown that air pollution is damaging to health cognitive performance labor productivity and educational outcomes. But air pollution also has a broader impact on people's social lives and behavior according Siqi Zheng the Samuel Tak Lee Associate Professor in MIT's Department of Urban Studies Pollution also has an emotional cost said Dr Zheng. People are unhappy and that means they may make irrational decisions. Researchers used pollution data from 144 Chinese cities and monitored general happiness of urban dwellers by looking at the mood using 210 million messages from China's largest microblogging platform Sina Weibo. They found a significantly negative correlation between pollution and happiness levels with every increase in pollution above a healthy level bringing happiness down by 0.04 points out of 100. On Monday some parts of London recorded Air Quality Index AQI levels of 151 more than 100 points above healthy limits. It suggests that people were four points unhappier than they would have been without polluted levels. For China pollution can rise into the 700s which could be having a major impact on happiness. Women were also found to me more sensitive to higher pollution levels than men as were those on higher incomes. The research was published in the journal Nature Human Behaviour.

The trough is about 3.5 km about 2 miles below sea level but there is no ocean water there. Instead it is filled with ice flowing from the interior of the ice sheet towards the coast. The trough measures about 100 km in length and is 20 km wide according to the study. This new discovery was presented at the American Geophysical Union's Fall Meeting in San Francisco. Dr. Mathieu Morlighem an associate professor in the Department of Earth System Science at the University of California at Irvine is leading this project. The biggest challenge about the project is that Antarctica is HUGE! he said excitedly. It's bigger than the U.S. and Mexico combined. Morlighem and his team used a new technology called BedMachine to make this discovery. They developed a new generation ice sheet model but it was not behaving as expected. The artificial glacier growing in the desert After months of investigation we realized that it was not because we were missing important processes. It was because the bed topography under the ice was missing many important features such as troughs ridges valleys etc he said. And because of the size of the area they were trying to map the process was very time consuming. The team combined radar measurements with high precision surface motion data from satellites and snow accumulation from regional climate models to get a good estimate of the shape of the bed where it had not been measured. We applied this mapping technique to the entire ice sheet and we discovered this very deep valley hidden underneath the ice sheet Morlighem said. He said one of the challenges they faced during the project was gathering all the available data since there have been many radar surveys but done by different institutions in different countries. They also had some surprises on the way. The main ones are these ridges across the Transantarctic Mountains Denman glacier but also some other glaciers feeding the Ronne Ice Shelf that seem to be more vulnerable than we thought Morlighem said. Morlighem says climate change could impact this region. A massive waterfall formed on Greenland's ice sheet. Here's why it matters We now have to monitor this glacier carefully. If its grounding line where the ice starts to float starts to retreat in this deep canyon it could retreat rapidly due to a mechanism called Marine Ice Sheet Instability. he said. Glaciers that flow on beds that deepen inland are unstable and so the glacier will potentially have to retreat all the way until the bed rises again leading to significant sea level rise. It could be one of the most vulnerable sectors of East Antarctica which holds significantly more ice than west Antarctica. But there is good news as far as climate change goes. The study says that major glaciers flowing through the Transantarctic Mountains and across Victoria Land are found to be protected by broad stabilizing topographic ridges near their grounding lines that reflect the surrounding topographic relief. The glaciers flowing across the Transantarctic Mountains all have a pronounced ridge across their troughs Morlighem said. These ridges were unknown and make this sector of the ice sheet extremely resilient to increase in ocean induced melting. In other words he said If the Ross Ice Shelf destabilizes it should not lead to a collapse of East Antarctica.	False	False	False	True	False
Following the pile up of months and months of scandals EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is finally out which means a significantly less notorious successor is now in. Introduced to the world via a tweet from President Donald Trump EPA Deputy Administrator Andrew Wheeler is set to take over the position in an acting capacity. Wheeler who was confirmed for the EPA deputy role in April appears to be cut from much of the same cloth as his former boss when it comes to rolling back environmental regulations. Here are three key facts to know about the person who will soon be overseeing the Environmental Protection Agency. Wheeler age 55 is a former lobbyist who represented Murray Energy a massive mining company as one of his chief clients. Murray Energy was among the companies Wheeler listed on his financial disclosures while he was being considered for the deputy administrator position. Others included Xcel Energy and General Mills. Murray Energy CEO Robert Murray is also a well known Trump adviser and supporter who Wheeler worked with closely. As a New York Times story lays out Murray was the architect of a so called environmental regulations wish list which detailed a list of policies aimed at reinvigorating the coal industry like curbing restrictions on greenhouse gases and slashing staff at the EPA. Wheeler and Murray were photographed at a March 2017 meeting with Energy Secretary Rick Perry where many of these policies were purportedly discussed. All this suggests that Wheeler wont be particularly aggressive toward the coal industry while in office. Andrew Wheelers coal credentials are without equal Sen. Edward Markey has said according to CBS News. He is without question a member of the coal industrys Hall of Fame. Wheeler was also a longtime staffer for Sen. Jim Inhofe serving as chief counsel for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee while the lawmaker was chair according to Inside Climate News. All told Wheeler spent 14 years working with Inhofe on the Hill. Inhofe was among Pruitts biggest fans although the barrage of scandals ultimately began to dim his enthusiasm. Inhofe is known for denying that climate change is affected by human activity once throwing a snowball onto the Senate floor to counter arguments about climate change and prove that it was very very cold outside. His former staffers have become nicknamed by some as the Inhofe mafia. During Wheelers testimony in a congressional hearing last fall he dodged a question about climate change I believe that man has an impact on the climate but its not completely understood what that impact is he said according to Inside Climate News. As the New York Times points out however there is one crucial way that Wheeler differs from his departing boss. Pruitt was Oklahomas attorney general before being named to Trumps Cabinet and an outsider who recklessly took advantage of the privileges he obtained. Wheeler is seen as a seasoned political operative who knows how to carefully traverse the system. He was also at the EPA as a special assistant in the agencys Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics for four years before he worked for Inhofe. Pruitts goals as EPA administrator have centered on crafting or destroying policy in order to establish a friendlier regime for the fossil fuel industry. His efforts have included revising emissions standards for cars and trucks increasing his control over the implementation of the Clean Water Act and weakening standards on hazardous chemicals. It appears that Wheeler is on track to do more of the same and his insider instincts and methodical nature could mean even more effective rollbacks. A number of Pruitt policies are thought to be shoddily constructed and have faced significant legal challenges. As Trump said himself I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda.	False	False	False	True	True
The Environmental Protection Agency is poised to dismantle the federal clean water rule which protects waterways that provide drinking water for about a third of the US population. The EPA with the US army has proposed scrapping the rule in order to conduct a substantive re evaluation of which rivers streams wetlands and other bodies of water should be protected by the federal government. We are taking significant action to return power to the states and provide regulatory certainty to our nations farmers and businesses said Scott Pruitt administrator of the EPA. Pruitt said the EPA would swiftly redefine clean water regulations in a thoughtful transparent and collaborative way with other agencies and the public. Green groups however said the move pandered to fossil fuel and farming interests and was part of an agenda to weaken clean water protections. Once again the Trump administration has agreed to do the bidding of the worst polluters in our country and once again its putting the health of American families and communities at risk said Michael Brune executive director of Sierra Club. We will fight this and every other attempt by polluters and the Trump administration to destroy our water resources. The planned rollback follows an executive order penned by Donald Trump in February which called for a review of the regulation also known as the waters of the United States rule that was introduced by the Obama administration in 2015. The rule was meant to end years of confusion over which waterways were federally protected from pollution with the clean water rule simply designating navigable waters for safeguards. The Obama administration widened this definition to include the drinking water of about 117 million Americans. But while the rule was applauded by environmentalists for improving drinking water protections and aiding wildlife that relies on wetlands it was attacked by some farmers and golf course operators who claimed it hindered their ability to manage their land. Trump has called the rule one of the worst examples of federal regulation and a massive power grab. Signing his order the president said thousands of jobs were at risk because the EPA decided that navigable waters can mean nearly every puddle or every ditch on a farmers land or anyplace else that they decide. While puddles arent mentioned in the rule the EPA does have greater latitude to regulate under it. However there is no evidence that the regulation could result in the loss of thousands of jobs. The National Mining Association another opponent of the rule and representative of an industry relentlessly backed by Trump welcomed its impending demise. This sets in motion a welcome correction to a deeply problematic regulation that ignored the careful balance that Congress struck between federal and state water regulation and constitutional limits on federal authority said Hal Quinn NMA president and chief executive. The clean water rule reversal which will now go through a period of public comment ahead of a final decision is the latest in a string of regulations to be paused or scrapped by the Trump administration. In recent months the EPA has wound back rules curbing vehicle emissions toxic waste from power plants and methane leaks from oil and gas drilling operations.	True	True	False	False	True
Joyce Farinato a pastor and artist who lost her Glen Ellen Calif. home in recent wildfires stands in the ruins Monday Oct. 23 2017 and shows a mask she found in the debris one of her few surviving possessions. Farinato said she wants to follow the environmental rules on cleaning burned sites but needs to know what they are. AP PhotoEllen Knickmeyer SANTA ROSA Calif. AP Government officials outlined plans Monday for what they say will be the largest fire clean up in California history aimed at removing hazardous substances and ash from 8400 homes and other structures burned in Northern California wildfires. With hundreds of anxious homeowners listening state emergency services official Eric Lamoureux set a target of early 2018 for completing the clean up and allowing owners to start rebuilding. California has declared a public health emergency in the fire area in part because of concern for hazardous substances ranging from freon in air conditioners to asbestos in older homes. The fires that began Oct. 8 have killed at least 42 people making them the deadliest series of wildfires in state history. The size and scope of this debris removal process will be one for the record books Sen. Mike McGuire a Democrat from the wine country town of Healdsburg told fire survivors at a Santa Rosa community forum. The meeting gave residents some of the first briefings on the clean up to come. Authorities have warned residents returning to the ruins of their homes to beware of possible hazardous residues in the ashes and required them to sign forms acknowledging the danger. Many survivors at Monday's forum and in fire zones where people are returning say they are confused about what authorities will allow them to do at their blackened properties before the massive waste removal. How do you get to get your mourning started if I can't stop and put hands on the scattering of possessions left asked resident Joyce Farinato who wore gardening gloves and a mask Monday as she walked through the chunks of concrete and bent metal that were all that was left of her home in rural Sonoma County. I'd like to know what's hazardous. What are we looking for? Farinato said. In Santa Rosa authorities with the Federal Emergency Management Administration and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers joined local and state officials answering other questions from homeowners. In two of the hardest hit areas Sonoma and Napa the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will be the agency that moves first removing any hazardous materials from the thousands of sites officials said Monday. State agencies would handle the same task in five other burned counties. The EPA effort would start this week said Lamoureux of California's Office of Emergency Services. Hundreds of teams led by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are to move in next removing ash and rubble. In Sonoma County the scene of the most destruction and deaths county officials will draft environmental standards to be followed by any homeowners who opt to handle the clean up themselves at their own expense officials said. For property owners who let the government handle the clean up taxpayers will cover any of the costs of debris removal that insurance doesn't Lamoureux said. Authorities have yet to put a price tag on the process. Homeowners shouted questions on matters ranging from their liability in the clean up to the extent that contractors would be scraping bare building sites. Laney Wall who lost her home in the Sonoma County community of Fountaingrove asked why homeowners had to go through the expense trouble and wait of the clean up at all. What legally is the justification for declaring my home site a hazardous waste site requiring this onerous process? Wall asked. Officials pointed to the public health concerns ranging from safety of residents in the burned neighborhoods to concerns for hazardous waste entering waterways and the air. Officials promised more town meetings. Homeowners said that was a good idea. I just have more questions now Danny Thom another Fountaingrove resident said after the meeting.

In Europe World Leaders Try To Change Trump's Mind On Climate Change It was eight against one according to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. On one side leaders of Canada Japan France Germany Italy and the United Kingdom plus two EU representatives. On the other side President Trump. And up for debate the peril of climate change and the urgency of the U.S. commitment to the Paris accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Merkel said that everyone at the table at the G 7 summit in Taormina Italy was urging Trump to stick with the pact according to Reuters. After that conversation Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn said the president's views are evolving and that he feels much much more knowledgeable after the conversation with world leaders. He came here to learn. He came here to get smarter Cohn said. His views are evolving which is exactly as they should be. Any decision on climate change would ultimately be based on what's best for the United States Cohn said. The Paris accord created in 2015 after lengthy negotiations calls on 196 nations to ratchet back greenhouse gas emissions. The goal is to keep the rise in global temperatures no higher than 2 degrees Celsius as compared with pre industrial levels. As NPR reported at the time the global average temperature has already increased about 1 degree Celsius. The deal includes voluntary pledges to reduce emissions. It also calls for developed countries to provide billions of dollars to help the developing world switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. The accord was historic in its scope and its ambition even though its reliance on voluntary pledges made it less robust than some advocates had hoped. On the campaign trail Trump said he would cancel the Paris deal. He has previously suggested that climate change is a hoax and appointed as the head of the EPA a man who said he does not believe human activity is a primary contributor to global warming. Climate change and its impacts have been observed by scientists working in multiple fields and the overwhelming scientific consensus is that human activity is the primary cause. But since taking office Trump has not moved to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris agreement. He has rolled back a number of Obama era climate change measures which will hamper U.S. efforts to fulfill its Paris pledges. But he hasn't retracted the pledges themselves. Just this week members of his administration indicated that the White House had not yet decided what to do on the issue. Before the conversation between Trump and the other G 7 leaders Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni noted that all the other countries had confirmed total agreement to the pact while the U.S. commitment was an open question. We are sure that after an internal reflection the United States will also want to commit to it Gentiloni said according to the Associated Press. But Gentolini and other world leaders weren't just waiting for internal reflection. They added some external pressure too. French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly discussed climate change with Trump at length on Thursday at a meeting in Brussels. Leaders of the Roman Catholic Church broached the topic when Trump visited the Vatican. And then there was the chat between the G 7 leaders. Merkel called the conversation controversial. Cohn said it was robust. Still to be determined whether it was persuasive or consequential.	True	False	False	True	True
The White House has declined to say whether Donald Trump believes human activity contributes to climate change as the president pulled America out of the Paris agreement. Administration officials were also unable to offer revised US carbon emission targets or say what changes to the global landmark accord would persuade Trump to re enter it. But they did offer assurance that America will abide by the lengthy exit process outlined in the deal waiting three and a half years to formally withdraw. Trump announced on Thursday the US would join Nicaragua and Syria as the only countries to shun the Paris agreement characterising it as a reassertion of Americas sovereignty and saying he was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh not Paris. There was a chorus of condemnation from world leaders former president Barack Obama and Trumps defeated election opponent Hillary Clinton who branded it a historic mistake. Shortly after Trump spoke in the Rose Garden at the White House to applause from supporters two senior administration officials briefed reporters in the west wing. The officials who did not wish to be named did nothing to alter perceptions of the US president as a climate change denier when asked whether he believed human activity was a contributory factor. One official replied So I think the fact that the president in his speech today said he wants to come back and renegotiate a better deal for the United States and for the world I think speaks for itself. The journalist shot back So is that a yes? Its a yes or no question. The official said Again I think that speaks for itself. The journalist pressed It doesnt speak for itself so is that a yes? Does he believe human activity contributes to climate change? The official said I have not talked to the president about his personal views on whether I was not with the president on his trip. I did not talk to the president about his personal views on what is contributing to climate change. The official insisted his own views were irrelevant while a White House staff member interjected Can we stay on topic please? The official echoed Can we stay on topic please? implying that Trumps views on the causes of climate change were irrelevant to the Paris decision. On 27 March the same official proved evasive on Trumps views when questioned by the Guardian. This week Sean Spicer the White House press secretary also said he had not asked the presidents opinion on the matter. Scott Pruitt the head of the Environmental Protection Agency has said he would not agree that carbon from human activity is the primary cause of global warming while in 2014 Trump referred to it as a hoax. On Thursday in a speech that kept a campaign pledge and echoed the fiery America first nationalism of his inaugural address Trump said As of today the United States will cease all implementation of the non binding Paris accord. During Obamas tenure the US had agreed under the accord to reduce emissions by more than a quarter below 2005 levels by 2025. The administration officials declined to specify new targets or give even a rough estimate of Americas intended nationally determined contribution to limiting greenhouse gas emissions. But they pointed to Americas existing record. I think leading the world is pretty good right? one said. I think that speaks for itself. The Paris accord came into effect on 4 November 2016. It makes provision for parties to withdraw but notice can be given only three years after it kicks in. Withdrawal would take effect a year after that meaning November 2020 a date that coincides with the next US presidential election raising the prospect that the issue remains alive during the campaign. First of all the whole withdrawal process will be consistent with the Paris agreement an official said. So the Paris agreement has to be in force for three years before you can actually submit a notice formally for withdrawal which takes at least a year. During this period the United States will not acknowledge or do anything to implement the current pledge put down by President Obama. Now whats the negotiating process? I think thats going to be determined by the president as we move forward. The leaders of France Germany and Italy joined to express regret at Trumps decision and insisted the agreement cannot be renegotiated. One of the administration officials responded If you look at the Europeans if you look at other major economies or allies or partners they have a strong interest in finding common ground with the United States and again we dont want to get out ahead of ourselves here on what may be discussed or not. There are a lot of different issues related to the international climate agenda that may not necessarily fall into the Paris bucket per se. He added The president is very sincere when he says he wants a better deal he wants to negotiate potentially bringing us back in Paris depending on what that looks like ... I think its a little bit more nuanced than stay in or not. Officials at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT challenged a set of talking points issued to support Trumps decision as misleading. A statement from MIT said The relevant MIT researchers believe that the Paris agreement is an unprecedented and vital effort by nearly 200 countries to respond to the urgent threat of global climate change.

The Trump administration pointed to key offshore drilling safety regulations adopted in the wake of the catastrophic 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in its sweeping proposal to open up nearly all U.S.waters to oil and gas development only to turn around in the months since and work toroll back those very safeguards. The controversial drilling plan released in January as part of President Donald Trumps energy dominance agenda would make available for oil and gas leasing roughly 90 percent of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf including large swaths of the Arctic Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The Interior Department led by Secretary Ryan Zinke noted in the lengthy proposal that while offshore oil and gas production will never be totally risk free the agency has made and is continuing to make substantial reforms to improve the safety and reduce the possible adverse environmental impacts of those activities. Elizabeth Johnson Klein the Interior Departments associate deputy secretary under Obama said the language first appeared in a draft of the current program released in January 2015. She said it references the Well Control Rule and the Production Safety Systems Rule two regulations that were under development back in early 2015 and are now on Trumps chopping block. The language also points to broader reform efforts that occurred after the Gulf spill including thedivision of the Minerals Management Service the scandal plagued agency faced with the conflicting tasks of issuing leases and policing offshore drilling operations into three new agencies. Days before the Trump administration unveiled its plans for a massive expansion of offshore drilling it moved to weaken the Production Safety Systems Rule a set of regulations pertaining to maintenance of offshore platforms. At the time the Interior Departments Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement one of the agencies born out of the reorganization of the Minerals Management Service estimated that the move would save companies some 288 million over 10 years. The changes finalized last month and slated to take effect on Dec. 27 loosen notification and certification rules for fossil fuel companies and toss out a requirement that offshore equipment be designed to withstand the most extreme weather and pressure conditions. In May the Trump administration took aim at the Well Control Rule a safety monitoring regulation meant to prevent the kind of incident that killed 11 workers and resulted in some 200 million gallons of crude oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico. Finalized in 2016 six years after the Deepwater Horizon disaster the rule requires additional inspection and maintenance of blowout preventers a device designed to automatically seal a well and stop an uncontrolled release of oil and gas. The Interior Departmentsproposed overhaulwould loosen the inspection and oversight requirements for this equipment. Like the rollback of the Production Safety Systems Rule this effort is all about helping industry. In fact many of the proposed changes to the Well Control Rule were requested by oil companies as Eric Lipton of The New York Times reported in March. In comments submitted to the agency in August 10 state attorneys general argued that weakening the rule at the same time as the Trump administration is looking to radically expand offshore drilling is analogous to taping over the mirrors and unbuckling ones seat belt just before getting on the highway. Donald Boesch a professor of marine science at the University of Maryland who served on the bipartisan commission that investigated the causes of the Deepwater Horizon blowout said easing the safety rules is both premature and ill considered. He also expressed concern about merging the two agencies but said the administration has in effect already done that by putting the safety bureau in the hands of Angelle a big proponent of offshore fossil fuel development. In April 2017 Trump signed an executive order aimed at opening up protected areas of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans to oil and gas leasing. It instructed the Interior Department to review the current five year program and write new rules for offshore oil and gas drilling under the guise of an America First Offshore Energy Strategy. If approved the leasing plan would go into effect from 2019 to 2024 and replace the current program which is set to run through 2022 and was approved following an extensive multiyear review. The offshore drilling announcement drew immediate outrage from both Democrats and Republicans who expressed concern about possible environmental damage and negative effects on tourism. Days after the proposals release Zinke traveled to Florida and announced that on the recommendation of Gov. Rick Scott a staunch Trump supporter he was removing the states coastal waters from consideration. Zinke walked backFloridas exemption after other states demanded that they receive the same pass. He has since hinted to officials from at least six states that the waters off their coasts will not be included in the final plan Reuters reported this week.	True	False	False	True	False
Since thenthat figure has risen to 400 scientific papers. Can you imagine the misery and consternation and horror this is going to cause in the corrupt rancid rent seeking world of the Climate Industrial Complex? I can. It will look something like this. Just to be clear so the greenies cant bleat about being misrepresented here is what these various papers say Modern temperatures sea levels and extreme weather events are neither unusual nor unprecedented. Many regions of the Earth are cooler now than they have been for most of the last 10000 years. Natural factors such as the Sun 106 papers multi decadal oceanic atmospheric oscillations such as the NAO AMOPDO ENSO 37 papers decadal scale cloud cover variations and internal variability in general have exerted a significant influence on weather and climate changes during both the past and present. Detecting a clear anthropogenic forcing signal amidst the noise of unforced natural variability may therefore be difficult. And current emissions mitigation policies especially related to the advocacy for renewables are often costly ineffective and perhaps even harmful to the environment. On the other hand elevated CO2 and a warmer climate provide unheralded benefits to the biosphere i.e. a greener planet and enhanced crop yields. In other words nobody is denying that climate changes nobody is denying that the planet has warmed by 0.8 degrees C in the last 150 yearswhile only a handfuldeny that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases has the power to influence temperatures. What they are saying in their different ways is that global warming as in the big scare story that the planet is heating up at a catastrophic unprecedented rate because of man made CO2 emissions is bunk or that the methods being used to combat the problem are bunk. Here courtesy of Kenneth Richard who has waded through them all are some examples of what they say. Greenhouse Effect Not the Main Driver of Climate Together with these 400 new papers that makes 900 science papers in the last two years casting doubt on global warming.	False	False	False	True	False
Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd our email newsletter. WASHINGTON The Environmental Protection Agency plans to change the way it calculates the health risks of air pollution a shift that would make it easier to roll back a key climate change rule because it would result in far fewer predicted deaths from pollution according to five people with knowledge of the agencys plans. The E.P.A. had originally forecast that eliminating the Obama era rule the Clean Power Plan and replacing it with a new measure would have resulted in an additional 1400 premature deaths per year. The new analytical model would significantly reduce that number and would most likely be used by the Trump administration to defend further rollbacks of air pollution rules if it is formally adopted. The proposed shift is the latest example of the Trump administration downgrading the estimates of environmental harm from pollution in regulations. In this case the proposed methodology would assume there is little or no health benefit to making the air any cleaner than what the law requires. Many experts said that approach was not scientifically sound and that in the real world there are no safe levels of the fine particulate pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels. Fine particulate matter the tiny deadly particles that can penetrate deep into the lungs and enter the bloodstream is linked to heart attacks strokes and respiratory disease.

Shell is preparing to set strict carbon emissions targets in 2019 amid intense pressure from activist shareholders who believe energy companies should be held accountable for aspects of global warming. The company also plans on linking such targets to the pay of senior executives subject to a shareholder vote in 2020. Shell is still in talks with investors about the percentage to be targets but the companys top employees salaries could be affected The Financial Times reported Sunday. We will be systematically driving down our carbon footprint over time chief executive Ben van Beurden told reporters Sunday. We all know the benefits of energy but there are associated effects that we have to manage. The pledge is a significant change in position for van Beurden who had previously opposed such proposals citing concerns about potential lawsuits. His concerns about potential waves of lawsuits are not unfounded. Environmentalists have convinced several American cities to sue Exxon Chevron and other energy companies to force them to pay for supposedly making disasters worse. Judges have already dismissed several lawsuits but the fear of future litigation is not lost on Shell and others. Shell now aims to curb emissions by around 20 percent over the next 15 years and the company will hammer out specific targets starting in 2020. The latest move was backed by Climate Action 100 a group of nearly 300 international investors carrying roughly 32 trillion in assets. The company has also pledged to review its connections to industry lobbying groups that oppose the Paris agreement a non binding deal crafted in 2015 with the goal of dramatically reducing global carbon emissions over the next 15 years. Activist shareholders have continually pushed energy companies to make bold moves showing their adherence to cutting emissions. Some analyst groups worry activist shareholders use a largely unregulated industry to hoodwink U.S. companies into accepting proposals designed to tackle climate change that carry little long term benefits.RELATEDA Federal Judge Torches Two Lawsuits Trying To Blame Oil Companies For Climate Change So called proxy advisory firms craft disclosure requirements that force companies to show they are taking efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The process especially disadvantages small companies in favor of larger companies that have the resources to comply with investor dictates the American Council for Capital Formation noted in May. Proxy advisory firms provide analysis and consulting services to issuers and companies about how annual and special proxies should be voted. The lack of transparency and competition in the proxy advisory firm industry gives a small number of businesses significant influence over how corporations deal with environmental issues.

They are essentially living corpses says Colombian scientist Rodrigo Bernal of Colombia's national tree. The ceroxylon quindiuense a distinct species of palm tree which was declared the country's national tree in 1985 is on the verge of extinction and most Colombians are not even aware of the problem. That is because it takes decades for the palms to show signs of decay even when they have already reached the end of their lifespan and scientifically they are dead explains Mr Bernal. He is one of the scientists who has been studying the trees over the past two decades and he is more than a little worried. Thousands of tourists travel to the Cocora Valley in Colombia's coffee region every year to marvel at the towering palms. But even in this area famous for its wax palms the trees are few and far between. The trees live for up to 200 years and because of their long lifespan their decay will only be seen by younger generations Mr Bernal told the BBC. This is why so many Colombians do not realise our national tree is dying out. Since 1989 the number of trees in the region has declined by 78 and there are now only about 2000 palms left in the Cocora Valley a group of scientists which has been monitoring the population says. The wax palms are not only a tourist attraction but a key component in the region's ecosystem. The fruits produced by the trees feed a large number of insects birds and mammals. But according to Mr Bernal the palms in the Cocora Valley are at risk. Much of the valley's once lush dense forest has been cut down to make way for cattle grazing. This poses problems for the seeds of the wax palm. They either get burned in the sun or they get eaten by the cows. Although the living trees are relatively healthy when they start to decay naturally there are no young saplings to take their place. The Quindo Wax Palm grows in very few areas in Colombia. Apart from the Cocora Valley they can be found in Tochecito an area in Valle del Cauca province. The little known Tochecito is thought to hold the largest number of trees an estimated 70 of the national total. But the fact that parts of the area were occupied by the now largely disbanded Farc guerrilla group means that research there was almost impossible. Scientists hope the number of trees may actually be bigger. Mr Bernal and his fellow scientists have turned their attention to Tochecito in the hope that they can preserve its wax palms before it is too late. With the area now safer and more accessible following the 2016 peace deal with the Farc rebels farmers are moving back and the scientists fear for the future of the national tree. We predict we could see half the wax palm population disappear in as little as 50 years' time says Luis Santiago Castillo Martnez of the Humboldt Institute an environmental research organisation. Tochecito is our best opportunity to protect the palms he says of the 42 sq km 16 sq mile area. The palm trees are legally protected under a law passed in 1985 which prevents their branches being cut off for use during religious celebrations such as Palm Sunday but there are few repercussions for those who completely fell the trees. Tochecito currently belongs to 40 private landowners and Mr Bernal along with the Humboldt Institute has been asking the Colombian government to declare the area a national park but so far with little success. The most we could achieve was to encourage the owners to declare their farms private reserves says Mr Bernal. Unfortunately there is a loophole to that status he adds. This just means your land is a protected area but it's an empty status as you can use your land however you see fit. If these landowners decide they want to clear their land they can. Mr Bernal and his fellow scientists have for years been urging the government to buy up the land a move they estimate would cost 10m 7.7m but so far no action has been taken. It's not a huge amount. It's cents for a nation like Colombia. The government has the authority to buy this land and protect the trees but refuses to do so. It is incredibly frustrating he says. The BBC approached Colombia's environment ministry ministry and the government body which oversees the management of Colombia's national parks for comment but did not receive an answer. Colombia's 58 national parks are managed by the National Parks Systems and while the number of those designated as protected in Colombia has been growing the budget has been cut leaving it struggling for resources. Mr Castillo says money is key The first step to protecting the palms will be to allocate the proper amount to the environmental sector. Mr Bernal and his fellow scientists have developed a management plan to save the species but the budget cuts mean their strategy is unlikely to be enacted. I'm so disappointed Mr Bernal says. This tree is beloved by Colombian people everyone knows it is our national tree But nobody knows we are about to lose it.	False	True	False	True	False
Bottled water firm Crystal Geysers heavily protested plans for a plant in Washington state are all but dashed after company execs accidentally sent an internal email calling the operation dead to the local press. Crystal Geyser bottles natural spring water and sells it to thirsty Americans with nearly one in five consumers drinking its beverages every month. However few are happy to live near the firms bottling plants where they say heavy traffic disturbs their sleep and the companys water collection activities threaten endangered species and destroy the rural character of their areas. Earlier this year Crystal Geyser bought land in Lewis County Washington. The company planned on building a 100000 square foot plant that would extract 400 gallons of water per minute from nearby springs. At present Crystal Geyser needs a county permit to begin operations. However in an email accidentally sent to The Chronicle but intended for a higher up Chief Operating Officer Page Beykpour said that the plan is likely dead because the opposition has successfully convinced officials and the media against us. Locals did come out in force against the plant with concerned citizens flooding council meetings since the plans were announced last month. Facebook groups have sprung up to oppose the plant and the local tribal council voted unanimously against it. Beykpour offered his boss two long shot options to push back against the public outcry. Option one involved hiring a PR firm to manufacture fake grassroots support for the facility and change the conversation. With pro corporate protesters likely to raise some eyebrows he outlined a more radical approach sue locals in the area for past damages to the local water system to bring them to the table. If both options were to fail Beykpour suggested we dump this site and move on. Once the paper got a hold of the email Crystal Geyser went into panic mode. The newspaper claims Beykpour called the Chronicle and pleaded for the email not to be published and admitted that the company is still mulling suing its neighbors. In his email Beykpour had claimed the Chronicle was in bed with the opposition. A lawyer representing Crystal Geyser called the newspaper and threatened legal action for running the story. The Chronicle rubbished the threat quoting a media law expert who stated that the companys email screw up was its own fault and not the newspapers. RT has reached out to Crystal Geyser for comment and is awaiting a response. Crystal Geyser is no stranger to local anger. Residents in Mount Shasta California were furious when the company announced plans to bottle water from a local aquefier in 2014 at a time when the state was threatened by drought and Californians faced mandatory water use restrictions. In 2018 the company was accused of illegally disposing of arsenic tainted wastewater from another of its California plants. According to a 16 count indictment Crystal Geyser discharged the toxic waste into a pond that staff dubbed the arsenic pond and then worked with two waste disposal firms to illegally transport the arsenic to a plant without a license to treat it.

Jessica Fujan chants on the Wacker Drive during a 100 Days of Failure protest and march Saturday April 29 2016 in Chicago. Thousands of people across the U.S. are marking President Donald Trump's hundredth day in office by marching in protest of his environmental policies. AP PhotoNam Y. HuhAP It seems like every week theres a new story about some completely unprecedented unpredictable environmental event. Antarctica is turning green. California is paralyzed by drought. Forests are shifting and the first climate refugees have lost their homes. The climate is changing and quickly. And we arent keeping up with it. This isnt because there is not enough scientific evidence to prove the threatthere is. It isnt because the majority of Americans dont believe climate change is caused by human activitythey do. And it isnt as has been suggested because weve become so immune to data that numbers arent persuasive anymore. We arent keeping up with climate change because the environmental movement is allowing a legacy of implicit bias to constrict its leadership and strategy. By refusing to challenge the long held belief that white environmentalists are the most informed prepared passionate dedicated defenders of our planet and its natural resources the movement silences communities of color. It silences the very people who often feel the greatest impact of a warming planet even though activists of color could make or break success for this work. In our new report Green 2.0 found that the environmental movementfrom boards to executive leadership to staffis still overwhelmingly white. Green 2.0 is an advocacy campaign that monitors and supports diversifying the racial and ethnic demography of mainstream environmental NGOs foundations and federal government agencies. We help hiring managers and executive search firms access the deep pipeline of qualified candidates of color help organizations build an equitable and inclusive culture internally and advocate for data transparency across the sector. For the past three years we have been working to build our database of the diversity of the top 40 NGOs across the movement. In 2014 we reported their staff and leadership demographics to create the first ever snapshot of the sector. It was that baseline that we used in the report we release today the Transparency Card which evaluates what kind of change has been made. We saw some encouraging progress. Overall environmental organizations have committed to improving diversity among their staff and board since we started this work. It is evidenced by the number of diversity committees managers and plans that have sprung up since 2014. Across the movement people of color represent 27 15 24 of staff leadership and board positions respectively in 2017. But theres still much more work to be done. More than 70 of those working in the space are white. Diversity is still seriously lacking at the senior leadership level. Two organizationsOceana and the Pew Charitable Trustsrefused to even participate in the survey. This is problem and not just a theoretical one. From Flint to Standing Rock weve seen that communities of color are disproportionately affected by pollution and climate change. When they dont have a seat at the table how can the movement be ready to systematically tackle issues that affect them uniquely? Without people of color in leadership and policymaking positions their perspectives are less likely to be included in outcomes. And furthermore with the environmental challenges facing us right nowfrom the new energy economy to ocean acidificationwe need all the creativity available to help us find pathways to clean food water and air. Its simple the more diverse the group discussing the problem is the more comprehensive sustainable and creative the solutions are. The time has come for radical thinking for inclusive problem solving for crowd sourced innovation. We have spent decades leaving people of color out of the environmental movement. Its time that we own our mistakes and get real about our shortcomings. Its long overdue that we intentionally count how many people of color are staffing and leading the professional environmental sector. Its urgent that we bring more voices into the conversation. Or we could let implicit bias and systemic racism undercut any chance we have at a sustainable future. The planet isnt going to wait for us to get this right. Its already far outpacing our efforts to respond to the crisis of climate change. Its time we stop letting it. Whitney Tome is the Executive Director of Green 2.0	True	False	False	False	True
The global strike set just days before September 23s U.N. Climate Action Summit in New York is expected to draw millions of activists who believe human activity is contributing to climate change and that drastic measures such as limiting meat consumption reforming the transportation sector and banning plastic straws need to be taken in order to combat the looming threat. Videos are surfacing from protests across the globe showing sizable crowds in places like Ireland Germany Australia Uganda and more Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn participated in the climate strikes in London and condemned President Trump for pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement. No more of this handholding with Donald Trump he told the crowd. We want every country on board on this There are also climate strikes taking place in major cities across the U.S. including Boston San Francisco Seattle D.C. and New York City. Famed teen activist Greta Thunberg who sailed to the U.S. in order to avoid making a massive carbon footprint will participate in the climate strike in New York City where over one million students have been given permission to skip class in order to protest climate change Many Democrat presidential candidates are praising the effort as protests continue to kick off across the nation.

Your lovely island of Madagascar is rich in plant and animal biodiversity yet this treasure is especially threatened by excessive deforestation from which some profit Pope Francistold authorities and diplomats on Saturday. The deterioration of that biodiversity compromises the future of the country and of the earth our common home he warned. The pope went on to enumerate his vision of the problem while also recognizing that many poor people derive their livelihood from activities that threaten the environment. As you know the last forests are menaced by forest fires poaching the unrestricted cutting down of valuable woodlands he said. Plant and animal biodiversity is endangered by contraband and illegal exportation. It is also true however that for the peoples concerned a number of activities harmful to the environment at present ensure their survival. So it is important to create jobs and activities that generate income while protecting the environment and helping people to emerge from poverty he declared. The pontiff tied together social and ecological problems insisting that the two are intimately intertwined. We are faced not with two separate crises one environmental and the other social but rather with one complex crisis which is both social and environmental he said. In a word there can be no true ecological approach or effective efforts to safeguard the environment without the attainment of a social justice capable of respecting the right to the common destination of earths goods not only of present generations but also of those yet to come he said. Pope Francis has made the care of the environment a central theme of his six year pontificate returning again and again to issues of ecological responsibility the dangers of carbon emissions and the scourge of climate change. In 2015 he became the first pope in history to devote an entire encyclicalletterto the topic of the environment with the publication ofLaudato SiPraised Be urging Christians to become more ecologically aware. In that text the pontiff said that the earth is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth as once beautiful landscapes are now covered with rubbish. He also denounced a failure to recycle paper and other resources while calling climate change a global problem with grave implications and one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day. Citing scientific studies the pontiff said that most global warming in recent decades is due to the great concentration of greenhouse gases carbon dioxide methane nitrogen oxides and others released mainly as a result of human activity.

The US arm of a European multinational oil and gas company has been approved to begin exploratory drilling in Alaskas Beaufort Sea. Environmentalists argue the Trump administration doesn't have the authority for such a move and it would endanger land and marine life. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management BOEM gave conditional approval late Wednesday to Eni US the US subsidiary of the Italian company Eni S.p.A. to drill four exploration wells from Spy Island an artificial island created in the Beaufort Sea in Alaska. Drilling can only be conducted in the winter months and is scheduled to begin in December 2017 and end in May 2019 BOEM said. The permit is for preparatory work and does not authorize Eni to produce oil. Over the past 30 days BOEM has been carefully evaluating the EP exploration plan in accordance with federal law and regulationsincluding site specific Environmental Assessmentand conclude with a Finding of No Significant Impact BEOM said in a statement. The Obama administration banned oil and gas exploration in most of the USs Arctic Ocean and Atlantic Ocean waters last year but President Donald Trump ordered Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in April to review the ban with the goal of opening up offshore areas for oil and gas drilling. Enis lease was due to expire at the end of 2017 according to Kristen Monsell an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity. The Trump administration provided the public only 21 days to review and comment on the exploration plan and only 10 days to comment on scoping for environmental assessment according to Monsell. Approving this Arctic drilling plan at the 11th hour makes a dangerous project even riskier Monsell told the Guardian. An oil spill here would do incredible damage and itd be impossible to clean up. The Center for Biological Diversity Greenpeace and REDOIL a coalition of Alaska native groups sued the Trump administration on May 3 citing the risk of offshore oil and gas exploration development to local communities and wildlife. The lawsuit also argued that Trumps reversal of the ban exceeded his constitutional authority and was thus unlawful. In the lawsuit the groups argued the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas are still undeveloped and are home to a rich array of unique wildlife species including polar bears walruses whales seals other mammals birds and fish some of which are classified as threatened or endangered. Some of these animals also support thriving indigenous Alaska Native cultural and subsistence activities stated the complaint. Several Arctic mammals including polar bears and bearded seals have been listed under the ESA Endangered Species Act. The region serves as important nurseries feeding grounds and transit routes for marine animals. Seismic surveys and drilling activities could cause disruption and threaten wildlife directly. The area is remote and foreboding the complaint said. In winter the seas are covered in ice and shrouded in darkness it is prone to storms and fog and there is little infrastructure to support industrial activity with just small communities and few jet runways. The region is hundreds of miles from the nearest Coast Guard station. Mentioned in the complaint is Shell Oils exploratory adventures in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas in 2012 which led to a series of problems mistakes and violations of environmental laws. During testing in the placid waters of Puget Sound Shell destroyed its oil spill containment drone. On the way north its drillship the Noble Discoverer dragged its anchor and nearly ran aground while moored near an Alaskan island. Once at the drill site in the Chukchi Sea Shell had to undertake an emergency maneuver to relocate the drillship to avoid a large ice floe. On its way back from the Beaufort Sea it lost control of its drilling vessel the Kulluk which ran aground in the Gulf of Alaska in severe weather and had to be towed to Seattle Washington and then scrapped. The US Coast Guard cited the Noble Discoverer for numerous deficiencies after the drilling season and the EPA determined Shell had violated the Clean Air Act during its drilling efforts and fined the company 1.1 million. Its drilling contractor pleaded guilty to eight felony offenses relating to environmental pollution and safety and agreed to pay 12.2 million in fines.	True	False	False	True	False
Chennai is out of water all 4 reservoirs are dry. More than 8.5 million live in greater Chennai so its about the population of greater San Francisco. An India government think tank predicts that by 2030 600 million Indians wont have sufficient drinking water. Its kind of amazing that they didnt see this coming long ago and plan better. And even 2030 wouldnt help right now which is what is needed. Rain is the solution but thats not exactly a sure thing when you are in the middle of a historic drought. Little that can be done right now except to keep on hauling water in from wherever they can. Many more will follow in part because people consider water to be a gift from God. People of India consume lots of water. If the price of water was higher they would consume less and there would be money available to search for new sources of water. The problem is when people think a resource is free and so plentiful that it can never run out that you get situations where it does run out. Clean water has a value. People should be paying what it costs to create and conserve or store fresh water. Regarding the price of water. Pricing will now have to include the risk of drought. The risk of drought is going up rapidly all over the world. I expect that India will need to invest in sea water desalination. That isnt cheap but whatever it costs those costs have to be passed on to the consumers. The rain and drought situation in India is grim. Most of the Indian cities towns and villages are reeling under severe water crisis. A tragedy is unfolding in Maharashtra and a money spinning racket for Tanker owners. Drought in more than forth of Maharashtra. Crores of rupees of the tax payers money will be used for tankers that will cause incredible pollution in the rural areas.Creation of many lakes all over the country to catch and store rain water is a primary objective. Water balancing between various rivers the so called River Linking Project is the second alternative. Once water is available in every village the distribution to houses can be taken up as the third step. Traditional systems perhaps might have to be tweeked a little according to the needs and changing times but there is so much to learn from those who came before us. Village Talab system is one example. When pond of one village was overflowed water was released for next village on slopes. Rainwater was harvested at home. In Junagadh Ahmedabad Cambay cities. I am not sure whether anyone in Tamil Nadu even knows it had a traditional water harvesting system. Similarly Odishas traditional Kutta and Munda water harvesting system by an NGO some decades back but I doubt if any university in Odisha is working on it or the State government is trying to revive the dying wisdom. This is true for all other states barring Karnataka which is trying to bring back the Kalyani water harvesting structures. Reviving traditional water bodies and harvesting systems has been talked for quite sometime but no one seems interested. The largest desalination plant in South Asia is at Chennai one of two there. It produces 36.5 million cubic metersyear. Thats 9.6 billion US gallons. Israel gets the majority of its drinking water from desalination. It has the worlds largest plant at Hadera producing 127 cubic meters from salt water plus it looks like it has larger plants as well. That 33.5 billion gallons. Chennai has a large desalination plant and a smaller one. Their policies are insufficient in many ways. Like what is water used for etc. Regulations on ground water pumping etc. I dont know specifics but do know that if a city this size runs out of water several people didnt do their jobs. Areas that are dry are becoming drier and those that are wet are getting more rain. But some of them have drier soil due to increased temperatures. The entire region from Syria to Iran has been suffering a drought that has been going on for about 15 years. At some point somebody has to call a spade a spade and accept the fact that the drought is the new normal. Seeding clouds can only bring as much rain as there is water in the atmosphere. Global climate change is in turn changing the distribution of where water is accumulating. At the least we must improve our water distribution systems to mitigate the problem. Seeding is only a short term solution. Build nuclear and desalinate Although there is no way nuclear can be added fast enough to by itself desalinate drinking water for 600 million by 2030. And India hasnt signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty. What are the chances India uses geoengineering? The public no tests no international treaties that will stop it. Geoengineering is cheap and not rocket science. A recent study indicates that almost nowhere will suffer under geoengineering. More studies are needed. The most likely is distributing air pollution in the stratosphere.I doubt that India will concern itself with niceties of international cooperation. Or whichever country leads the way. Thats why there has been a campaign for more than a decade test and make treaties. But we were busy.	False	True	False	True	False
The Magic School Bus is back in the new Netflix series The Magic School Bus Rides Again! Overall it's still a nice fun 13 episode series like we remember from when we were kids but with some left turns. There is a pretty predictable take on climate change propaganda for little kids but that wasn't the worst. That dubious honor goes to the episode that teaches kids that a monster will eat them if they don't use alternative clean energy sources. In the show Miss Frizzle takes her class on educational field trips with the help of a magical school bus that allow them to learn about things like magnets allergies and states of matter. In the original series the kids were taught by Miss Valerie Felicity Frizzle Lily Tomlin who is now Professor Frizzle. She hands the charge of her classroom over to her sister Miss Fiona Frizzle voiced by Saturday Night Live's Kate McKinnon. Most of the episodes are innocuous enough. The kids have a scientific question of some kind in the classroom and Miss Frizzle takes them to the Magic School Bus where an incredible field trip helps them to understand. This might be a trip to discover how different animals blend into their surroundings to hide from predators how the brain coordinates different parts of the body or what lies deep under the sea. But episode 10 The Tales Glaciers Tell is the first of two questionable episodes. Miss Frizzle's student Dorothy Ann also known as D.A. has been asked to join her storyteller parents in telling a story of her own for a crowd. However she's more into data than storytelling so the kids take a trip to a glacier allowing her to tell the story of you guessed it climate change which is met with a standing ovation by the audience. Really? This is what kids are getting excited about? I doubt it. Of course conserving energy is a good thing and we should be kind to the earth but this climate change hysteria is taking over. Usually somebody will say that 97 percent of climate scientists agree that humans are causing global warming and I was surprised that figure didn't come up in this episode. Could it be that they know how easily debunked that number is? Given the way Dorothy Ann presented man made climate change as fact I doubt it. This issue tends to play incredibly well in the mainstream media as they use climate change as the universal bad guy so I'm sure there were plenty of parents who actually thought this episode was a good idea. I find it hard to believe any parents were happy about this next one though. Episode 12 Monster Power teaches kids that a monster will eat them if they don't use alternative clean energy sources.Albert one of the students has seen a movie in which the evil monster loves pollution and is coming for us next for what we've done to this planet! With the class camping in the woods Miss Frizzle and the other students help him come up with clean energy alternatives wind water etc so they won't be eaten. Instead Miss Frizzle could tell him that monsters aren't real but I guess that didn't occur to her. While it makes sense to teach kids the science of pollution and about all kinds of energy I wouldn't have minded some talk about oil in the dinosaur episode to be honest why would they tell kids that a monster will eat them for using the wrong energy source? I may not have the teaching credentials of Miss Frizzle but I'm pretty sure that's not scientifically accurate.They must really hate fossil fuels as much as their friends on the left. Keeping in mind that the TV Y rating for this series means it's for kids 2 6 I'm sure there are going to be some parents pretty irked at bedtime when kids are scared of the blot monster. Overall this is a cute series and fun bit of nostalgia for those of us who enjoyed the original books or TV series as kids but I could have done without the climate change propaganda and telling kids that traditional energy sources attract monsters is way over the top. Can't kids just learn without an anti scientific social agenda?	True	False	False	False	False
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC broke a two year partisan deadlock Thursday night to approve a liquefied natural gas LNG export terminal in Louisiana. Top Department of Energy DOE officials said this was a major breakthrough that will alleviate a growing problem for U.S. energy producers a lack of export infrastructure. We have been promoting US energy around the world and todays decision by the FERC is a very important one DOE Deputy Secretary Dan Brouillette told The Daily Caller News Foundation in an interview.RELATED US Oil Output Hits 12 Million Barrel A Day Milestone Way Ahead Of Schedule The Calcasieu Pass LNG export terminal is the first such project to get FERC approval in two years. Republican FERC commissioners Neil Chatterjee the chairman and Bernard McNamee worked with Democrat Cheryl LaFleur to hash out an agreement to get her support. Chatterjee and McNamee needed LaFleurs vote to approve Calcasieu Pass which they secured after working out a new approach to account for greenhouse gas emissions from the export facility. This is a tremendous breakthrough DOE Under Secretary of Energy Mark Menezes told TheDCNF. We hope it will serve as an analytical template going forward. Once complete Calcasieu Pass terminal will export up 12 million metric tons of LNG a year. Brouillette said the project already has buyers including in Europe waiting for American natural gas. Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling spurred an oil and natural gas boom over the past decade making the U.S. the worlds top hydrocarbon producer. However a limiting factor on oil and gas is the lack of export terminals and pipelines. Menezes said breaking FERCs deadlock was also an important step in helping DOE improve its own LNG terminal approval process including making sure theres no duplicative reviews. Getting approval to build an LNG export terminal is a long complicated process that requires approval from multiple agencies. FERC currently has a backlog of a dozen LNG projects awaiting approval.RELATED Obama EPA Regulations Blamed For Closure Of 100 Year Old Coal Plant The Trump administration has been pushing for speedier approvals for LNG terminals but FERC has been holding up the process amid pressure from environmental groups to factor global warming into its approval process. LaFleur for example called on FERC to factor in estimates like the controversial social cost of carbon for a cost benefit analysis. However LaFleur agreed to compromise with her Republican colleagues. FERCs other Democratic commissioner Richard Glick opposed the terminalarguinghis colleagues were deliberately ignoring the consequences that its actions have for climate change. The commissions environmental review of Calcasieu Pass found the facility would emit roughly 3.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year about 0.07 percent of total U.S. emissions. Brouillette argued that while an individual LNG export terminal would emit greenhouse gases it would help lower global emissions because countries want gas as an alternative to coal. To the extent that LNG is displacing coal around the world we think the impact is going to be positive Brouillette said. Brouillette also stressed the geopolitical implications of LNG exports and the role energy could play in President Donald Trumps foreign policy. These are decisions that impact the presidents ability to make foreign policy decisions Brouillette told TheDCNF.

DETROIT Theresa Landrum survived her battle with cancer. But her parents didnt. Neither did at least 10 other people who lived on her block. Such is life and death in the 48217 Michigans most polluted ZIP code home to automotive plants the states only oil refinery and more than 8200 mostly working class African Americans. On Tuesday Landrum a retired General Motors factory worker marched downtown with as many as 2000 fellow Detroiters to the steps of the Fox Theatre where 10 Democratic presidential hopefuls were scheduled to face off in thesecond round of primary debates. The protest marked one of the most confrontational demands for a Green New Deal in months as local groups took up the mantle from national climate campaigners which have shifted their efforts to focus on demanding a climate only Democratic primary debate. Amid the gleaming towers of automotive giants whose vehicles now spew the majority of Americas climate changing gases the demonstrators called for a future in which the health of the planet and its people guides industrial planning andin which the Motor City sheds its association with combustion engines. We are being robbed and pillaged by industry Landrum said her voice rising to a preachers righteous crescendo. Then you know what we get? A few job promises and they get to pollute as much as they want. The three word slogan surged into Americas political lexicon last November when activists with the youth led Sunrise Movement occupied then incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosis office demanding Democrats champion climate policy that actually matches the scope of the crisis. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D N.Y. took heed. In February she and Sen. Ed Markey D Mass. introduced a resolution that outlined the core tenets of a Green New Deal. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warrens growing inventory of policy proposals includes plans to decarbonize the military by 2030 halt fossil fuel leasing on public lands and put new restrictions on businesses ability to influence lawmakers. California Sen. Kamala Harris the only candidate to bring up the Green New Deal in the first round of debates co sponsored a climate justice bill with Ocasio Cortez this week that lays the groundwork for federal climate spending to benefit poor minority communities who disproportionately suffer the impacts of pollution. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders who has yet to release a comprehensive climate plan has positioned himself as the standard bearer of former President Franklin D. Roosevelts economic ideals and a vocal proponent of the Green New Deal movement. Climate change received a combined 15 minutes of airtime during last months debates in Miami woefully insufficient given the scope of the crisis but significant progress for an issue that was virtually ignored in the 2016 election. But because the events were held in a city threatened by rising sea levels debate questions focused on the magnitude of the global warming crisis and the risks posed by runaway emissions. The Frontline Detroit Coalition the alliance of a dozen local environmental groups and unions who organized Tuesdays march struck a markedly different tone. If Miami is a city in need of salvation from rising seas Detroit in their vision could be the savior. Ahead of the march musicians and activists took a makeshift stage in Cass Park a historic green space where last months record heatwave left the grass crisp and brown and led crowds chanting build a new economy and invest in our community. The Green New Deal is a platform an empty box. Its not going to be fully ready until it begins to reflect the kind of environmental and energy issues that our people are concerned about said Darryl Jordan 65 the co director of the East Michigan Environmental Action Council. Were not in a state where the differences between Democrats and Republicans are that radical. If there is poetry in demanding a Green New Deal in the city that birthed the automotive age the citys union legacy gives the call real teeth. Powerful construction unions that depend on the fossil fuel industry for lucrative jobs have publicly opposed the Green New Deal though the movement has garnered growing labor support including an official endorsement from the Service Employees International Union last month.

Ivanka Trump on Thursday retweeted a White House message hailing the administration as a driver for science and Twitter was agog. The initial tweet was posted the White House Office of Science and Technology after it issued a report titled Science Technology Highlights in the Second Year of the Trump Administration. On Wednesday The Washington Post reported that Trump was convening a panel the Presidential Committee on Climate Security to question the findings of federal scientists and experts on climate change andcounter red alert warningsfrom the scientific community. President Donald Trumps pick to head the committee William Happer once compared the demonization of CO2 to how Jews were characterized in Nazi Germany. Happer who has no experience in climatology has said having higher atmospheric carbon dioxide levels is beneficial. Trump said late last year that he didnt believe a dire report by federal agencies about climate change declaring Were the cleanest weve ever been. His run ins with climate science were repeatedly highlighted in responses to the retweet by thefirst daughter and senior White House adviser. For the past two years the Trump Administration has been an active and meaningful driver for science and technology policy in America. pic.twitter.comJQkiWI4Dx2 White House OSTP February 21 2019 Donald Trump has said he will pull the US out of the Paris international climate agreement! taken steps to cut back the US Environmental Protection Agency is on record saying that global warming is a hoax invented by the Chinese to attack US manufacturing......

Washington CNN Toy gun grasped firmly in his hand and a grin plastered wide across his face while he played Big Buck Hunter Pro Ryan Zinke could have been a kid at an arcade. But the Interior secretary and former congressman was actually in the department cafeteria showing off the arcade game installed to commemorate hunting season. To highlight contributions 2 conservation I installed Big Buck Hunter in the employee cafeteria. Get excited for season! Zinke tweeted from his personal account Tuesday. But Zinke is not toying around when it comes to his support of hunters and fishers. Hunting in the United States is down. A US Fish and Wildlife Service survey released last week found that there are 2.2 million fewer hunters in America now than in 2011. And the new administration is poised to change that. On his first day in office back in March Zinke issued two orders one which overturned a recent ban of lead ammunition and fish tackle on Fish and Wildlife Service lands and waters. Last week Zinke issued another secretarial order designed to increase access to various public lands for hunters and fishers. What really kind of expedited this whole thing was last week the US Fish and Wildlife put out a survey saying that hundreds of Americans were enjoying the outdoors but within that survey they found that hunting was down Heather Swift Interior spokesperson said when asked about last week's secretarial order. And the big thing that the secretary hears over and over again is that people just don't have access to land. Mr. Zinke was the pick of the litter not the best litter ever but he was definitely the pick and that's why we advocated for him and that's why Jr. advocated for him as well said Land Tawney the president of the Montana based Backcountry Hunters Anglers a non profit sportsmen's organization. Zinke and the Interior have recently made a big show of their support of hunting groups. In addition to the Buck Hunter game he gifted Interior employees the department declared Thursday that October would be National Hunting and Fishing Month. The declaration also generated the support of the National Rifle Association. Hunters anglers and target shooters are the best conservationists who contribute so much through the Pittman Robertson and Dingell Johnson Acts said Richard Childress NRA vice president. Last year they contributed 1.2 billion toward conservation and protecting our natural resources. We need more mentors taking young people out and teaching them to hunt and fish so I'm glad Secretary Zinke is promoting hunting and fishing at the federal level. With what's leaked it's super troubling. Any reduction on these monuments is an attack on the Antiquities Act said Tawney. All monuments are at risk now. They can become political footballs in our eyes. Conservationists who want to expand their access to hunting on public park lands and at monuments are as weary of opening up national park land to fossil fuel industries as environmentalists are since both value sustaining the land as is. We can have all the access we want to a concrete parking lot but that access doesn't mean anything if that fish and wildlife habitat isn't there said Tawney. Another pro hunting group says what they are seeing within Interior is a fight between access and conservation. On the access front the department has been good. Access to our own public lands is a lot harder today than it ever has been and that is in part introduced with the decline in hunting numbers we've seen said Whit Fosburgh president and CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership a non profit coalition of conservation organizations and outdoor related businesses. On the conservation side however I think it's a much less rosy picture Fosburgh said. It's been a lot more about expanding development opening up to oil and gas. There has been no proactive conservation vision espoused for our public lands. Fosburgh said that the hunting community started getting a little bit critical of Zinke after he first announced the National Monument Review earlier this year. And he's skeptical of just how far the secretarial order will go. They use hunting and fishing for an excuse for our changes in monuments he said. All of the ones under review already allow hunting and fishing very clearly. Fosberg's criticism is similar to what environmental groups said following the secretarial order last week. Don't be fooled the Trump Administration is pretending to be granting hunting and fishing rights that are already guaranteed by law and policy said a statement from the Center for American Progress a left leaning thing tank. The real story is that with this announcement the Trump administration is trying to create a distraction from their plans to dramatically reduce the size of America's national monuments which would be the largest elimination of protections on wildlife habitat in US history. Nevertheless Fosburgh said most pro hunting and conservation minded groups are still hoping for the best with the Trump administration. We're very prepared and we have been from day one. We supported his nomination and we are prepared to work with Secretary Zinke he said. We're not going to just say it's a lost cause in September of the first year of the administration.

Aswildfirescontinue torageacross the Westduring a brutally hotsummer on Thursday the US Forest Service released itsnewforest fire management strategy thatfocuses on science and thechanging climate. The report comes at the same time the president has sent out misleading tweets aboutthe causes and solutions of Californias wildfires and as Donald Trumps Interior head Ryan Zinke has blamed fires on environmentalists denied climate change science and called for more logging. Zinke has said the forest fires have nothing to do with climate change and recently called the left angry intolerant and uninformed on the environment and public land management according to the Huffington Post. But the Department of the Interior disputes this in an email to Mother Jones saying The Secretary addressed the correlation between climate and fires dozens of times over the 48 hours he was in California and all week in interviews since returning. Additionally in his op ed the Secretary directly addressed longer hotter drier seasons in the opening paragraphs.Its true that Zinke changed his tuneafter his earlier comments Zinke told reportersThursday that climate change has played a role in the fires and that global temperatures are rising. Trump weighed in on Californias fires on Twitter earlier this month with tweets that were immediately described as false and misleadingsaying California wildfires are being magnified made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which arent allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilizedMust also tree clear to stop fire spreading! Mother Jonesasked an expert to decipher this nonsense and you can read his analysis here. But today the Forest Servicewhich is part of the Department of Agriculture released anew 28 page fire management strategy. In itthe service writes Of particular concern are longer fire seasons and the rising size and severity of wildfires along with the growing risk to lives homes natural resources and other values. The report also includes a map of changes in fire weather seasons in the United States between 1979 and 2017 a phenomenon scientists warn is largely due to climate change Though the Forest Service doesnt mention the words climate change specifically aspast versions of the plan have it points out that changes in temperature precipitation patterns and other environmental conditions are all driving factors behind wildfires and other environmental challenges. And in the Appendix the Forest Service writes effects of a changing climate are a general threat to forest health. Its a breath of fresh air to see science instead of politics inserted into forest and fire management saidKirin Kennedy associatelegislative director for lands and wildlife at the Sierra Club in a statement. The longer Ryan Zinke continues to ignore these facts the greater the risks to homes and families.	False	False	False	False	False
Environmental groups plan to sue the Trump administration over offshore drilling tests launching a legal fight against a proposal that has drawn bipartisan opposition along the Atlantic Coast two people with direct knowledge of the pending litigation told The Associated Press. The lawsuit which aims to stop the issuance of permits for the use of seismic air guns will be filed by a coalition of environmental groups in federal court in South Carolina on Tuesday according to the individuals. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly before the suit is filed. The Trump administration has authorized five such permits which aim to find oil and gas formations deeply below the Atlantic Ocean floor from Delaware to central Florida an area where seismic surveys haven't been conducted in decades. The blasts are conducted in preparation for potential offshore drilling which the administration has proposed to expand from the Atlantic to the Arctic and Pacific oceans. The five year plan would open 90 percent of the nation's offshore reserves to private development. Survey vessels will be required to have observers on board to listen and watch for marine life and alert operators if a protected species comes within a certain distance officials have said and acoustic monitoring will be used to detect those animals swimming beneath the ocean surface. Surveys would be shut down when certain sensitive species or groups are observed and penalties could be imposed for vessels that strike marine animals. The precautions aren't enough for environmental groups who have said the blasts can disturb marine mammals. Industry groups say the surveys have been conducted around the world for decades with little adverse impact. The drilling issue has created strange political bedfellows along the East Coast with Democrats and Republicans in some areas united over the issue. In South Carolina's 1st Congressional District Republican Katie Arrington a supporter of President Donald Trump who initially said she stood by his plans to open up Atlantic Coast drilling later backed off that support amid a growing wave of drilling opposition in the coastal district she aimed to represent. Arrington ultimately lost the general election to Joe Cunningham a Democrat staunchly opposed to drilling who collected support from coastal Republican mayors. Voters said they had been turned off by what they saw as Arrington's flip flop on the issue and they turned instead to Cunningham's consistency. On Monday Cunningham told the AP that he backed the legal effort which would pair with legislative action he plans to take up in the U.S. House. I'm going to go up to D.C. and fight like hell Cunningham said. These lawsuits are one tool in our bag that we're going to use. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster's early support of Trump's candidacy hasn't stopped him from opposing the president's drilling plans. Earlier this year McMaster was among state executives to request a drilling waiver seeking the same sort of promise already given to Florida Gov. Rick Scott another Trump ally. Since then officials from the Department of the Interior have said Secretary Ryan Zinke's promise to Florida was not a formal action and will instead be part of the department's analysis as it completes its plans. In February McMaster met with Zinke at the Governor's Mansion in Columbia. This week McMaster spokesman Brian Symmes told The Associated Press that the governor and the state's top prosecutor both Republicans would continue to work on a plan to keep drilling away from the state. The governor and Attorney General Alan Wilson have resolved to continue working together to determine the best path forward Symmes said. Anything and everything is on the table to keep us from seeing seismic testing or offshore drilling off the coast of South Carolina. State Rep. Nancy Mace a Republican representing parts of the greater Charleston area supports the lawsuit which she called South Carolina's best option to challenge federal government overreach. The government doesn't get to pick winners and losers in this thing Mace said. When you have every mayor every community saying 'We don't want this' and now you're going to shove seismic testing down our throats? I don't think so. Mace said she is concerned both with potential environmental damage and the possible threat to South Carolina's 20 billion tourism industry much of which centers around the coast. We have the potential to destroy that beauty off our coast with rigs that nobody wants Mace said. We've got to do something and a lawsuit might be the only way to do it.	False	False	False	True	False
Trumps recently installed EPA chief dismissed a study from his own department's scientists about the dangers of climate change and then admitted he never even read the study in the first place. The study produced by EPA scientists andpublished in the journal Nature Climate Change concluded that climate change will affect 22 major sectors in the United States including human health infrastructure and agriculture and that the damages in some sectors are estimated to range in the hundreds of billions of US dollars annually by the end of the century if we do nothing and allow carbon emissions to remain high. But EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler a former coal lobbyist and a pro pollution apologist doesn't care. Just because our scientists publish something in a journal doesnt mean that thats agency policy or all the other scientists at the agency agree with that particular study Wheeler told Reuters. But Wheeler's quick dismissal of the report was followed up by an admission that he had no idea what it actually said. I have not read that article I just saw a news a clip about it but I haven't read it and I haven't talked to the scientist that wrote it Wheeler said. Wheeler was appointed to head the EPA after Trumps first scandal plagued EPA chief Scott Pruitt was ousted. And Wheeler's approach ignoring science in favor of industry and pollution is a perfect reflection of Trump's shameful approach to climate issues. The administration and its officials regularly disregard the scientific consensus about the harms of climate change in order to justify rolling back regulations and trashing initiatives designed to make the world cleaner and safer. Trump himself once infamously promoted the false conspiracy theory that climate change is a hoax from the Chinese government. Currently Trump is trying to create a senior level government panel that would oppose the scientific facts of climate change and instead promote baseless propaganda from pro pollution crackpots. Most U.S. government agencies are refusing to participate in the project. However Trump is still receiving plenty of help from congressional Republicans who refuse to take the climate crisis seriously. Senate Republicans have relentlessly made false and disingenuous attacks on the Green New Deal a sweeping Democratic proposal to help stop climate change before it's too late while also creating jobs and protecting vulnerable communities. And in the House Rep. Thomas Massie R KY made a viral fool of himself by attacking former Secretary of State John Kerry after he tried to raise concerns about how climate change would harm national security. Climate change is real. It is a threat to America and to all of humanity. But Trump and his fellow Republicans refuse to acknowledge reality and they certainly can't be bothered to read scientific reports about it. Published with permission of The American Independent.

The people who live there are at risk of lead contamination at every turn. It's in their drinking water and it's in their soil. More than one thousand people were forced to evacuate according to Debbie Chizewer at Northwestern Law School who has worked very closely with the affected residents. A local school was shut down and a public housing complex was also evacuated after soil tests showed lead and arsenic contamination levels 228 times the amount the Environmental Protection Agency considers potentially hazardous to children. It was the first superfund site EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has visited making a trip there Wednesday and the agency said he was the first administrator to visit this particular site. Pruitt visited to discuss cleanup and hear directly from East Chicago residents affected by contamination in their community the agency said in a press release. At a press conference local officials praised Pruitt for visiting the site. The community is what's a called a legacy contamination site. It was listed on the National Priorities List of the worst contaminated hazardous waste sites in the country in 2009. The site includes part of the former USS Lead facility along with nearby commercial municipal and residential areas including the West Calumet public housing complex. Barbara Bolling Williams state president of the Indiana branch of the NAACP said she is cautiously optimistic following Pruitt's visit but added that his visit comes with the threat of a skinnier EPA budget fewer regulations and rumors Chicago's regional EPA office could be shut down looms in the background. The Trump administration's proposed budget calls for a 31 cut to the budget including cuts to the agency's environmental justice program. The program is intended to support poor often minority communities with severe environmental challenges. One week ago the local chapter of the NAACP said it invited Pruitt to a roundtable discussion on environmental justice which happened Wednesday morning. In attendance were residents NAACP national President Cornell Williams Brooks and community members. Pruitt skipped that event and instead invited a group to a meeting of his own at a local school that was shut down as a result of the lead contamination in the community. Bolling Williams who was invited to Pruitt's meeting said Pruitt listened to all of our concerns but he did not offer any solutions. She said her organization wants to see the EPA do more to protect the East Chicago community. The NAACP presented Pruitt with a list of demands including a call for an executive order that would include a greater commitment to communities like East Chicago. We need them to commit to adjusting cleanup plan for the site. Instead of digging up two feet of contaminated soil for disposal digging up eight feet. We want that soil to be disposed of properly so as not to cause further contamination we want continued testing of the soil and ground water in this area and a commitment to ensure the residents exposed to the lead get the physical and mental health care they need for the rest of their life. That includes financial help to make sure that happens. EPA spokesman J.P. Freire told CNN in an email Forget about the politics. Administrator Pruitt was working for environmental justice by meeting with the real residents affected by lead contamination and by committing to get results. In its press release the agency laid out the accomplishments of its cleanup effort under Pruitt East Chicago is receiving 16.5 million in EPA State Revolving Fund SRF funding for drinking water infrastructure upgrades. EPA the state and the city are working together to coordinate lead service line replacement with cleanup work to expedite completion of the work and minimize disruptions. EPA provided 54 homes with filters and bottled water while Superfund work was underway at those properties in Zones 2 and 3. This year Indiana will distribute filters to all residents in Zones 2 and 3. The Natural Resources Defense Council told CNN that Pruitt has yet to respond to its request for more EPA assistance and oversight in the lead problem in East Chicago's drinking water. Those demands include Oversight of East Chicago's ongoing attempts to improve its corrosion control treatment expanded blood lead level testing of children under age 7 bottled water and home water filtration systems to residents throughout the city and testing the city's drinking water to determine the extent of the contamination. During his visit Pruitt provided brief comments at a press conference in East Chicago but quickly exited without answering questions from reporters. The Agency's press release quoted Pruitt saying I'm focused on getting EPA back to the basics of protecting human health and the environment and one of my top priorities is delivering real results for the people of East Chicago.' Pruitt went on Since I was sworn in as administrator funding has been secured for drinking water infrastructure upgrades in East Chicago filters and bottled water have been provided to residents and cleanup of contaminated soil has resumed.

Kirsti McCluer Reuters Golfers play in North Bonneville Washington last fall as the Eagle Creek wildfire burns. The U.N.'sIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said the world must drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions to avoid climate disaster. The only force that I know of on the planet that can deliver innovation as quickly as we need it is the free enterprise system said former Rep. Bob Inglis R S.C. now the executive director of RepublicEn a group urging Republicans to support a carbon tax. The report based on more than 6000 scientific references found that world governments have just 12 years to cut planet warming gases 45 percent at a time when humanitys CO2 footprint is rapidly rising and fossil fuel emissions are hitting an all time high. By 2050 emissions need to hit net zero. Failing to do so would be cataclysmic. The IPCC pegged the price of damage caused by 1.5 degrees of warming at 54 trillion a figure that soars to 69 trillion at 2 degrees Celsius or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit of temperature rise. There is near universal agreement that putting a price on carbon dioxide likely through a tax is key to scaling back emissions in much the same way levies on tobacco and alcohol are meant to offset those products societal costs. Last yearSens. Sheldon Whitehouse D R.I. and Brian Schatz D Hawaii and Reps. Earl Blumenauer D Ore. and David Cicilline D R.I.introduced companion carbon tax billsin Congress. In July Reps. Carlos Curbelo R Fla. and Brian Fitzpatrick R Pa. proposed a lower carbon tax earning plaudits for breaking with the Republican orthodoxy calling the very basics of climate change science into question. Its totally unrealistic said Jennifer Francis a research professor at Rutgers University. Were going to need to make a wide range of course corrections to have a hope of achieving 1.5 and also prepare for larger impacts than were already experiencing. Andrew Dessler a climate scientist at Texas AM University cast doubt on the possibility of halting human caused temperature at the 1 degree Celsius average global increase the planet has already experienced. Though he said a carbon tax high enough could reduce emissions arbitrarily fast the result would be soaring energy prices rather than what we want which is a switch to renewables. Asked during an IPCC press conference on Sunday night if carbon pricing could radically overhaul the global economy in the next decade two IPCC authors started to laugh. James Skeaa co chair of an IPCC working group said it was one among that portfolio of instruments that can be used but could not serve as a panacea. A number of insurgent left wing Democrats running in the 2018 midterms including star New York City congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio Cortez are coalescing around a so called Green New Deal a loose set of proposals to spend trillions in federal dollars on renewable energy projects coastal fortifications and home weatherization retrofits.Polling released last month shows swelling support for a federal policy guaranteeing a high wage job in a green industry to anyone who wants one. Last month California became the biggest state to pass alaw requiring 100 percent clean electricityby 2045. In a surprise move Gov. Jerry Brown D also signed an executive order mandating the changessweep extend beyond utilities to the entire economy including vehicles the nations largest source of carbon pollution. Curbelo and Fitzpatrick did not respond to requests for comment Monday. Nor did the oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp. which spent decades financing a network of climate change misinformation before announcing its support for a carbon tax or the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative a corporate consortium that advocates for what it calls practical solutions to climate change. But for some conservative climate hawks the reality of the IPCC report hit home. Jerry Taylor a former climate denier who in recent years became the poster boy for Republican climate realism said he sticks by a carbon tax as the best solution but believes keeping warming within 1.5 degrees is unrealistic at this point regardless of policy. A steep enough global economy wide price on carbon could do it but thats not likely to happen said Taylor the president of the libertarian Niskanen Center. Hence the 1.5 C target is aspirational not functional. Over lunch at a conference last week Flint staked out his opposition to the Obama administrations use of executive authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. A former Trump transition team official he described himself as a sherpa for Interior Secretary Ryan Zinkes confirmation process. Now he says hes trying to get politicians to catch up with the science. Asked where the line is between what critics said was the previous administrations federal overreach and attempting to stave off the worst of what the IPCC predicted Flint went quiet for a while.

US President Donald Trump is taking California to task for the management of its forests and dams blaming red tape for the devastating forest fires and drought plaguing the bluest of blue states and threatening to withhold aid. Speaking at a White House address on Tuesday Trumpwas shocked that Californians weren't using the water contained by their dams to put out the fires and irrigate their fields. We have so much water they could actually water some of it he said in disbelief. About half 48 percent of California's land is currently experiencing drought conditions which combined with high temperatures and strong winds are largely to blame for the record setting rash of fires in the state according to state fire chiefs. Trump a proud climate change skeptic attributes the fires to lousy management. He has repeatedly said the forests are too dense and need to be thinned a problem the logging industry would be happy to help with. As for the water it's Trump vs. the Delta smelt an endangered fish scientists argue can only be saved if the dammed waters are allowed to flow into the ocean instead of being used to irrigate the farms and homes of California residents. Trump wants to redistribute that water to Californians he says. Trump threatened to withhold future federal aid if Californiadoes not get on the ball implying that the state's environmental woes were its own fault. It's hard not to think there's an element of spite in this rhetoric as wealthy and influential Californians led talk of secession following Trump's 2016 election victory. Last week Trump signed a memo geared toward improving the reliable supply and delivery of water in California Oregon and Washington by streamlining environmental review and approval for water infrastructure projects. It's not a good week for the Delta smelt. Trump announced yesterday he will nominate Aurelia Skipwith a former Monsanto lawyer as director of the Fish and Wildlife Service. While she has worked for the department since 2013 environmentalists accuse her of gutting protections for migratory birds and endangered species.	False	False	False	False	False
Not that surprising except this was a Senate committee field hearing challenging the position shared by President Donald Trump and many Republicans in Congress that climate change isn't real. The site of the hearing just four miles from Trump's weekend getaway in Palm Beach was clearly intended to send a signal Much of Florida's coastline could one day be underwater including some of the President's own prized properties. Today we sit at ground zero of the impacts of climate change in the US Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson said. And while there are still some who continue to deny climate change is real South Florida offers proof that it is real and it's an issue we're going to be grappling with for decades to come. Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show that Trump's Mar a Lago Club and his condominiums in Hollywood Florida would be partially submerged if sea level rose three feet by the end of the century. Already Hollywood experiences more incidents of tidal flooding. NOAA itself in a recent report raised the specter of millions of coastal residents in the United States especially along the low lying East Coast being displaced by coastal flooding. The agency outlined how sea levels could rise by at least four to five feet by century's end engulfing numerous coastal communities or making flooding so frequent as to render them uninhabitable. What we thought was extremely rare large floods invading coastal cities on a regular basis is becoming more and more probable said William Sweet an oceanographer at NOAA and the report's lead author. The gap between our infrastructure and the global sea level is narrowing A recent study published in Nature concluded that with the acceleration of ice melt in Antarctica sea levels could rise to six feet by 2100. At that point Trump's golf course at Doral Florida and several properties at Sunny Isles Beach would also be under water. The fact that Trump's own properties are vulnerable to the impact of climate change is paradoxical given that the EPA is poised to undo President Barack Obama's plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions from coal fired power plants. In a now infamous 2012 tweet Trump claimed that global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non competitive. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non competitive. Donald J. Trump November 6 2012 The Senate Commerce Science and Transportation Committee hearing was conducted by Nelson the panel's ranking member but it was authorized by Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota the committee's chairman who has acknowledged human activity is responsible for climate change. Climate change is not just a threat to our planet's future it's a threat to our communities today. Thanks for this hearing. pic.twitter.comixO6VhRhrO Rep. Ted Deutch April 10 2017 Thune told Fox News anchor Chris Wallace in a 2014 interview for example Well look climate change is occurring it's always occurring Chris. There are a number of factors that contribute to that including human activity. The question is what are we going to do about it and at what cost? Trump has proposed slashing the EPA budget by a third and eliminating many climate change programs entirely. But when it comes to his own property in Ireland a golf course and resort in the small town of Doonbeg the President took a more proactive approach. He proposed to build a wall to fight coastal erosion by the course's sand dunes which eroded after heavy storms in 2014. After several attempts to gain approval the President refiled an application in December 2016 and is still waiting to get an authorization from the local county council. For many coastal communities the problems have already begun. Flooding and high winds are more frequent said Sweet the NOAA oceanographer. Hurricane Sandy broke through the sea walls of several homes near Mar a Lago in 2012 and Palm Beach County had to restore more than 20 acres of eroded seashore. Miami meanwhile is investing millions of dollars to raise the level of its properties its roads and water systems as protection against flooding. Other cities like Norfolk Virginia and Charleston South Carolina that are at risk of extreme flooding are also trying to deal with the issue. Christina DeConcini director of government affairs for the environmental group World Resources Institute said the US needs a fact based approach for how to address this clear and present danger to America's infrastructure homes and businesses. What won't solve the problem is putting our heads in the Florida sand while streets and basements flood around us she said in a statement. Palm Beach County Commissioner Steven Abrams downplayed the political aspects of the Senate committee hearing in a statement Friday. Sea level rise and coastal flooding driven by climate change pose real significant risks to our residents and should not be politicized he said.	False	False	False	False	False
Two water districts in Sacramento California are suing the US government for nearly one and a half billion dollars for groundwater cleanup. Plaintiffs claim heavy metals used by aircraft maintenance crews at the old McClellan Air Force Base have contaminated over 300 sites. The lawsuits named the US Air Force and 10 major firms involved in supplying chromium products and chemicals to the base and was filed by the Sacramento Suburban Water District and the Rio Linda Elverta Community Water District according to the Sacramento Bee. At contention is whether the cancer causing chemical hexavalent chromium or chromium 6 came from the base which was designated a federal Superfund site in 1987 for 326 contaminated sites identified for cleanup. They knew or should have known that this harmful compound would reach groundwater pollute drinking supplies render drinking water unusuable and unsafe and threaten the public health and welfare stated the complaint which claims an underground storage tank likely held the chemical. The lawsuits demands more than 1.4 billion to clean up the polluted wells install treatment equipment and replace wells that have been decommissioned for being polluted with chromium 6. Sacramento Suburban seeks to recover the substantial costs necessary to protect the public and restore its damaged drinking water supply the water districts lawsuit filed in federal court in Sacramento says as part of its claim seeking 1.1 billion in damages. Rio Linda Elvertas claim seeks more than 289 million in damages. Chrome 6 is a highly toxic compound and it shouldnt be in the water Victor Sher a San Francisco environmental attorney representing the plaintiffs said Tuesday. Water districts are constantly balancing risks against cost he said adding Theyre committed to delivering water that is as free as possible of contaminants but doing so is expensive. Plaintiffs argued that as far back as 1984 McClellan had burn and burial pits trenches and unlined ponds and ditches contaminated with chemicals. Contaminated with plating wastes solvents acids waste oils paint thinners strippers and sludges and other hazardous compounds the lawsuits stated. Plaintiffs argue that the chemicals have been found in groundwater under the base as high as 840 parts per billion six times higher than levels that decrease away from the air base. The state set a maximum concentration for chromium 6 as 10 parts per billion in 2014. The Air Force denied Rio Linda Elvertas claim in a May 9 letter before the district sued in federal court on June 30. The Air Force had consistently denied responsibility for polluting the groundwater around the base which operated from 1936 through 2001 before being converted to a business park. In addition to the Air Force the water district lawsuits name 10 firms they say were associated with providing chemicals to the base Elementis Chromium Inc. Occidental Chemical Corp. Honeywell Inc. BASF Corp. PPG Inc. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours and Co. Luxfer Holdings PLC Sigma Aldrich Corp. and Dow Chemical Co. Officials with Sacramento Suburban which serves 175000 customers just east of the old base and Rio Linda Elverta which serves about 15000 customers to the west of the base say the water they are currently providing is safe. A 2016 Harvard study of some36000 EPA water samples taken from 2013 to 2015 at industrial sites military fire training locations airports and wastewater treatments plants containedlevels of perfluoroalkyl substances PFASs or perfluorinated chemicals that go beyond what is considered safe by the federal government. Researchers determined that drinking water for 6 million in the US is at or beyond the EPA safety threshold for PFAS levels. Xindi Hu the study's lead author warned that the actual number of people exposed may be even higher than our study found because government data for levels of these compounds in drinking water is lacking for almost a third of the U.S. populationabout 100 million people.

WASHINGTON Reuters The U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee passed a spending bill on Thursday evening that includes 10 million to help fund the United Nations climate change body that oversees the Paris Climate Agreement despite President Donald Trumps decision to stop funding it. The 30 member Senate panel which allocates federal funds to various government agencies and organizations approved a 51 billion spending bill for the State Department and foreign operations which included an amendment to continue funding the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change as well as the scientific body the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The amendment passed even though the 2018 budget proposal that Trump a Republican introduced earlier this year eliminated support of any mechanism to finance climate change projects in developing countries and organizations. The United States is still a party to the 1992 UNFCCC which oversees the Paris agreement although Trump announced in June that he would withdraw the nation from the global climate pact and cease funding the Green Climate Fund which supports clean energy and climate adaptation projects in vulnerable countries. The United States has usually contributed to around 20 percent of the UNFCCC budget. Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon the amendments author said on Twitter on Thursday Despite dangerous decision unwillingness to act we can will fight back to combat The amendment passed 16 14. Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee voted in favor as did all committee Democrats except for West Virginias Joe Manchin. Although the United States announced it would no longer be a party to the Paris Climate Agreement a pact that nearly 200 countries approved in 2015 to combat global warming it has said it will continue to observe the ongoing negotiations. In a diplomatic cable that Reuters obtained last month Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said U.S. diplomats should sidestep questions from foreign governments on how the United States plans re engage in the global Paris climate agreement. The cable also said diplomats should make clear that the United States wants to help other countries use fossil fuels which have been linked to global warming. L1N1KU0UP	False	False	False	False	False
Participants included the CEOs of Italian oil giant ENI British Petroleum ExxonMobil and Norways Statoil as well as scientists and managers of major investment funds. Their remarks on the first day of the closed door conference were not released by the Vatican. While Francis lauded the oil executives for embedding an assessment of climate change risks into their planning strategies he also put them on notice for their continued search for fossil fuel reserves 2 years after the Paris climate accord clearly urged keeping most fossil fuels underground. Civilization requires energy but energy must not destroy civilization he implored. Energy experts and those who advocate fighting climate change expressed doubts before the conference that it would amount to anything other than a PR opportunity for the companies to burnish their image without making meaningful changes. In his remarks the pope said he hoped the meeting gave participants the chance to re examine old assumptions and gain new perspectives. Francis said that modern society with its massive movement of information persons and things requires an immense supply of energy. And still he said as many as one billion people still lack electricity. The pope said meeting the energy needs of everyone on the planet must be done in ways that avoid creating environmental imbalances resulting in deterioration and pollution that is gravely harmful to our human family both now and in the future. Frances also recalled his own appeal in the Laudato Si encyclical for an energy policy aimed at averting disastrous climate changes that could compromise the well being and future of the human family and our common home. That includes transitioning to efficient clean energy sources. This is a challenge of epochal proportions he said Saturday. At the same time it is an immense opportunity to encourage efforts to ensure fuller access to energy by less developed countries as well as diversifying energy sources and promoting the sustainable development of renewable forms of energy. The pope called for a long term global strategy to provide energy security along with precise commitments to tackle the challenge of climate change. He said it was disturbing and a cause for real concern that the levels of carbon dioxide emissions and the concentrations of greenhouse gases remain high despite commitments taken in the 2015 Paris accord to fight global warming. He urged participants to use their demonstrated aptitude for innovation to address two of the great needs in todays world the care of the poor and the environment. He noted that the poor pay the highest price for climate change often being forced to migrate due to water insecurity severe weather and an accompanying collapse in agriculture. The transition to accessible and clean energy is a duty that we owe toward millions of our brothers and sisters around the world poor countries and generations yet to come the pope said.

Greenpeace founder turned climate change skeptic Patrick Moore has reignited his feud with Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez calling her a pompous little twit and garden variety hypocrite in a barrage of tweets. Moore helped found the veteran eco organization in the 1970s before parting ways with his fellow activists over their left wing politics and becoming an advocate for nuclear power and lobbyist for the forestry industry. Lately he has been tussling with New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez over the Green New Deal an ambitious piece of environmental legislation that seeks to dramatically overhaul Americas energy sector and economy in a bid to slash carbon output. Moore began picking the Green New Deal apart in February ridiculing its promise to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Technically he stated this would mean removing all H2O vapour and all CO2 which would mean the eradication of all life on Earth. The legislation has been ridiculed from all sides for its proposed abolition of air travel and fossil fuel powered vehicles as well as its estimated cost of over 50 trillion over twice the worth of the entire US economy. Ocasio Cortez has stuck to her guns however. In a tweet the Bronx Democrat told skeptics If you dont like the Green New Deal then come up with your own ambitious on scale proposal...until then were in charge. Moore hit back calling AOC a pompous little twit and claiming that if fossil fuels were banned every tree in the world would be cut down for fuel for cooking and heating. You would bring about mass death. More recently a New York Post hit piece lambasted Ocasio Cortez for using cars to get around while campaigning in New York instead of the subway system. I also fly and use AC Ocasio Cortez responded. Living in the world as it is isnt an argument against working towards a better future. The world as it is has the option of taking the subway rather than a taxi Moore continued. You're just a garden variety hypocrite like the others. And you have ZERO expertise at any of the things you pretend to know he tweeted on Sunday before calling AOC an immature bully. Ocasio Cortez more mainstream Democrat colleagues have paid lip service to the Green New Deal but have been cautious about declaring support for the plan. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi brushed it aside in an interview with Rolling Stone on Thursday saying it goes beyond what our charge is. In addition to slashing carbon emissions the deal calls for widespread wealth redistribution to counteract systemic injustices and includes provisions for universal healthcare and taxpayer funded college tuition. An early overview of the plan since removed from Ocasio Cortez website promised economic security for all who are unable or unwilling to work swore to sideline the private sector in all environmental decision making and even vowed to eliminate farting cows. Republicans argue that the deal is tantamount to full blown socialism. Its more outlandish provisions have turned it into a punching bag for the GOP who have sought to paint the Democratic party as the party of socialist totalitarianism ahead of next years election. After referring to AOC as a raving lunatic President Donald Trump said on Saturday that the deal is the new Democrat platform and I dont want to talk them out of it...I want them to embrace this plan. I just want to be the Republican who runs against them. Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!	False	False	False	False	False
This story was originally published by High Country Newsand is shared here as part of theClimate Deskcollaboration. TheGreen New Dealand its proponents aim to tackle the intertwined issues of social and environmental justice in our age of anthropogenic climate change. To accomplish this they believe they must deploy the federal government since it is the only institution large enough to coordinate and invest in the necessary policies. But the idea of expanding the role of government has attracted critics whorail against socialism. To historians this sounds familiar. This is not the first time socialism new deals and the environment have intersected. During the catastrophe of the Great Depression of the 1930s the federal government similarly attempted to ameliorate social and environmental harms by investing in people and places through the New Deal. Then as nowcritics dismissed it as socialism. The socialist sobriquet stokes ideological fires but douses historical understanding. One prominent exampleBob Marshalls argument for nationalizing forests during the 1930sreveals how socialist solutions emerge from specific contexts and problems not ideological bunkers. In Marshalls case the dire state of private timberlands in the early 20th century prompted his call for reform. When massive problems develop cross jurisdictional lines and are associated with market failures big government responses can seem like the only possible solution. By the early 20th centuryhundreds of years of unregulated cutting had ravaged the nations forests and Americans faced a crisis that demanded intervention. Rocks and mountains may be ageless but men and society are emphatically of the present and they cannot wait for the slow process of nature to retrieve the catastrophe caused by their unthinking destructiveness wrote Marshall a forester for federal agencies throughout his career a co founder of The Wilderness Society and the person for whom Montanas Bob Marshall Wilderness Area is named. A massive evaluation of American forestry conducted by the Forest Service in 1932 both shaped and reflected Marshalls views. Appearing the next yearA National Plan for American Forestry known as the Copeland Report showed that private forests were failing. The majority of the nations timber came from privately held forests just as it does today. They burned more often were not harvested to provide a continual crop of timber failed to protect watersheds and offered few recreational opportunities compared to public forests. They caused social problems too with lumber workers doing dangerous transient jobs that resulted in mangled bodies and left hollowed out towns behind. As Marshall saw it The private owner is thus responsible for almost every serious forest problem. So Marshall argued that American timberlands should be publicly owned. In 1933 four years into the Depression and during the first year of Franklin D. Roosevelts presidency Marshall publishedThe Peoples Forests his own radical extension of the Copeland Report which advocated for public ownership of practically all commercial forests in America. He was writing amid an economic catastrophe mirrored in the nations wild and rural landscapes where bankrupted farmers out of work loggers and drought driven refugees were common not unlike today. ThroughoutThe Peoples Forests Marshall showed how private ownership even when tempered by public regulation fell short only full public ownership could keep forests and communities healthy. He united a biological and social vision for forestry one where human happiness and decent livelihoods might sprout from robust forests. In articulating that vision he made his socialist case plain The fundamental advantage of public ownership of forests over private ownership is that in the former social welfare is substituted for private gain as the major objective of management. Much the way todays Green New Deal seeks to redress both economic and environmental impoverishment Marshall sought to replace private profit with a broader public spiritedness that aimed for long term stability ending cut and run practices and ultimately strengthening communities. Marshalls call for reforms reflected an accelerating trend of expanding public lands in the 1930s when the federal government acquired millions of acres for national parks national forests andwildlife refuges. Newly passed laws like theMigratory Bird Hunting Stamp Act 1934and theBankhead Jones Farm Tenant Act 1937helped the government fund refuges acquire property for conservation and bail out private owners who lived on wrecked lands. Starting around the same time and lasting until the 1950s Forest Service administrators advocated for public regulation of logging on private land principally citing concerns about declining timber production and the threat of fire on poorly managed parcels. Though ultimately unsuccessful those efforts illustrated a push to establish stability amid unsettling crisis a goal Marshall shared. When capitalism stumbles badly producing degraded lands and gaping inequalities socialistic solutions rise in popularity because their incentives are not tied to profits. Marshalls closing line argues for that perspective The time has come when we must discard the unsocial view that our woods are the lumbermens and substitute the broader ideal that every acre of woodland in the country is rightly a part of the peoples forests. Shouting socialist as an epithet isa tired strategy a failure to reckon with specific contexts and problems whether its damaged timberlands in the 1930s or rising sea levels today.The Peoples Forestsand the Green New Deal highlight the ways social and environmental harms are woven together a reminder that real solutions require a mutual untangling and that despite American history and politics suspicion of true socialism government necessarily holds many of the threads.

WASHINGTON Andrew Wheeler is no longer the acting director of the EPA following the Senate's vote Thursday to make him the official head of the environmental regulatory agency. The Senate narrowly confirmed Wheeler 52 47 largely along party lines with Republicans in support and Democrats againsthim. While leading President Donald Trump's deregulatory agenda Wheeler also has emphasized the agency's work to clean up Superfund sites and for the first time begin regulating a set ofharmful chemicalsfound in drinking water systems that serve millions of Americans. Mr. Wheeler has proven his ability to advance pragmatic solutions to pressing environmental challenges Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R Ky. said on the Senate floor before the vote. Maine Sen. Susan Collins was the lone Republican to oppose Wheeler's confirmation. While calling Wheeler certainly qualified for this position Collins said some of the policies he has proposed as acting administrator are not in the best interest of our environment and public health particularly given the threat of climate change to our nation. A former EPA bureaucrat who also served as an influential Capitol Hill stafferand an energy lobbyistWheeler hadbeen acting administrator of the agency since July when he replaced Scott Pruitt who left under an ethical cloud. When Trump nominated Wheeler for the official post in November the president praised him for performing a fantastic job. Though not as controversial or ethically compromised as PruittWheeler is opposed by a number of environmental groups who sharply criticize the president's aggressive efforts to undo Obama era rules they say are designed to protect the environment and address climate change. It's a sad day for public health and the EPA but missionaccomplished for the fossil fuel and chemical industries Ken Cook president of the Environmental Working Group said in a statement following the vote. They have longed for one of their own to call the shots at the agency and now they finally have their man in Andrew Wheeler. At his confirmation hearing in January Senate Democrats grilled Wheeler about his agency's proposals toroll back mercury emissions standards weaken clean water regulations and scrap Obama era climate change rules. Related President Trump made the right pick for EPA Sen. Barrasso Shortly after taking over in July Wheeler's EPA moved aheadwith a planto do away with the Obama era Clean Power Planand replace it with aproposed rule to set state guidelines for power plant emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to a warming planet. And his agency finalizedrevisions to a 2015 Obama era rule regulating thedisposal of coal ashthat gives states and utilities what he called much needed flexibility to manage their waste. He alsorecommended freezing miles per gallon standards for cars and light trucks after the 2020 model yearand preventing California and other states from setting tougher standards saying it will improve safety andkeep prices lower for consumers. We haven't slowed downand we haven't missed a step Wheeler told senators in August. As you can see we're continuing the president's agenda post haste.	False	False	False	False	False
Nineteen of the 25 Democratic presidential candidates have gone on record in favor of holding a debate devoted to climate change policy. In the past three days four more candidatesincluding Kamala Harrishave told Mother Jones that they support a climate debate raising the stakes for the Democratic National Committee which has so far resisted allowing such an event to take place. In addition to the California senator New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio former Rep. John Delaney Md. and former Rep. Joe Sestak Pa. are now calling for a climate debate joining big name candidates including Joe Biden Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Earlier this year the DNC announced plans to hold a dozen primary debates in 2019 and 2020 and to prohibit candidates from appearing in any debates that had not been approved by the national party. In April climate activistslaunched a grassroots campaign demanding that one of the debates be dedicated to climate they noted that presidential debate moderators had a long history of giving short shrift to the issue. Its not just because activists want to vet candidate platforms and solutions but because even getting candidates to talk more about an issue can raise the issues profile. The activists quickly won support from Washington Gov. Jay Inslee who has put global warming at the center of his campaign. But the DNCs line all along has been that it wouldnt hold any issue specific debates. The controversy reemerged after the first round of Democratic debates last week. Climate received 15 minutes of discussion over two nights but the largely superficial discussion of the issue only seemed to strengthen the activists case as key policy proposals such as the Green New Deal and 100 percent renewable energy mandates were virtually ignored. DNC officials spent the weekend reconsidering the matter. The result was a pair of resolutions that could come up for a vote at the partys August meeting. One proposal backed by DNC executive committee member Christine Pelosi and others would create a climate debate. A separate resolution which Pelosi described as less ideal would call for a forum in which candidates would appear individually to address climate policy. A third way forward she suggested might include an effort to survey party members about which issues deserve a standalone debate. It was somewhat ironic we DNC officials spent more time debating climate in our debate on Saturday than the candidates did Wednesday and Thursday Pelosi said. If a climate debate does happen much of the credit will belong to activist organizations like the US Youth Climate Strike a teen led group that has pressured candidates into endorsing the efforts. They plan to join with another youth oriented group Sunrise Movement to keep up the pressure throughout the summer. Still six candidates either havent taken a position on a climate change debate or didnt respond to requests for comment in time for publication. They are Sen. Cory Booker who called for more time to be devoted to the issue after the first debate Montana Gov. Steve Bullock former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper Wayne Messam the mayor of Miramar Florida California Rep. Eric Swalwell and author Marianne Williamson. Heres what each of the candidates have said Biden addressed a Greenpeace activist at a campaign rally in Ottumwa Iowa on June 11 Thats what we should be doing he said. Im all in man. Take a look at what Im talking aboutand by the way the first climate change plan in the history of the Congress? The campaign confirmed his position to Mother Jones in July. He tweeted in response to a Youth Climate Strike activist The candidate tweeted a video of her reading a letter from an activist asking her to sign a petition for a climate change debate. Im up for that she said. She also backed Inslees pushback against the DNC Harris communications director told Mother Jones Shes said she is happy to debate. Harris previously hadnt said publicly that she supports a climate change debate. Buttigiegs campaign did not clarify the candidates position on a debate but a staffer says he plans to continue to address the issue of climate change at every debate and every event that he attends. ORourkes campaign did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication to confirm Youth Climate Strikes tweet Booker supports more climate change discussion but the campaign toldMother Jones that the decision is in the hands of the DNC. John supports having a climate debate his communications director wrote in a July 1 email. Climate has been a big part of our campaign and we mentioned our carbon fee and dividend plan during the debate last week. A DNC debate focused on climate change would show the world that America intends to lead again on this issue and would be a smart place to discuss the key tenets of the Green New Dealinfrastructure green jobs and clean air and waterand how to put a price on carbon she told the Daily Beast. Bennet toldPolitico he thought a climate debate would be great. Inslee was the first candidate to endorse a climate change debate on April 17 launching his own petition aimed at the DNC. I cannot rule out any other debate that would highlight both the necessity of defeating the climate crisis and calling for the candidates to step up to the plate Inslee said in an interview with Mother Jones. Sixty second sound bites which is all youll be able to get in a party debate is grossly inadequate to the task. The candidate wrote on Wednesday in an email to Mother Jones How could you not? It is the most destructive threat to America and mankind.	False	False	False	False	False
Senate Democrats used the Wednesday confirmation hearing of Andrew Wheeler the acting administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to push him on the agencys negligence on climate change its rollback of regulations designed to protect Americans health and his uncannily close ties to the fossil fuel industry. Do you agree with the scientific community that climate change is a global crisis? Sen. Bernie Sanders I VT asked Wheeler repeatedly. I would not call it the greatest crisis no sir Wheeler responded. I consider it to be an issue that has to be addressed globally. Substantively I think you have your thumb wrist forearm and elbow on the scale Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse D RI told Wheeler referring to Wheelers past work as a coal lobbyist. Some Republicans raised concerns about climate change as well. At a few points the hearing was interrupted by protesters and chants of shut down Wheeler not the EPA. Eight protesters were arrested. Wheeler for his part emphasized in the hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee that the EPA was revising Obama era environmental regulations like the Clean Power Plan and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards to comply with court rulings. It was a signal that he plans to continue to methodically advance Trumps agenda but in a much less bombastic way than former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt who resigned last year in disgrace after numerous allegations of ethics violations. Some Democrats even praised Wheeler for his collegiality and for being much more accessible than Pruitt. However others said he was tilting regulations in favor of the sectors the EPA is supposed to regulate for instance weakening pollution regulations on coal fired power plants. Before his work as a coal lobbyist Wheeler was a staffer at the EPA and on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. He was also an Eagle Scout and emphasized his love of hiking and camping. I do consider myself a conservationist he said. Unlike Pruitt Wheeler did acknowledge that humans are driving changes in the climate and that it must be addressed. When Sen. Jeff Merkley D OR asked Wheeler how he rated climate change in importance on a scale of 1 to 10 Wheeler said it was 8 or 9. Yet global emissions continue to rise and scientists recently warned that were running out of time to accelerate the global effort to limit warming to a less disastrous level. Instead of joining this effort the EPA is working to relax rules on emissions. And given that Wheeler answers to President Trump who has dismissed climate change as a concern its unlikely well see any radical changes at the EPA anytime soon. The Senate is expected to confirm Wheeler soon as the new head of the agency in a vote. Several Republicans brought up climate change during the hearing noting their concerns about the rise of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States in 2018 which Wheeler had disputed. We heard that there was an emissions rise in 2018 which you attributed to a cold winter a hot summer and also to more economic activity said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito R WV. You said you expect that to go down over time. What gives you the confidence that if this economy continues to roll the way we think it will that will actually happen? Wheeler said that greater energy efficiency in the power sector along with fuel economy standards would continue to drive down emissions. Sen. John Barrasso R WY suggested that technology is the main solution to greenhouse gases and asked Wheeler about the EPAs role in fostering innovation and using tactics like capturing carbon dioxide to extract more oil or make building materials. Wheeler said that all of EPAs programs encourage innovation. One thing thats important on the regulatory side is that we dont try to tip the scale one way or the other for example on energy sources he said. That Republicans are acknowledging climate change at all is a sign that the political winds on the issue have shifted and they can no longer afford to be passive on the issue if they want policies on their terms. And innovation seems to be the key thread uniting Republican responses to climate change. As my colleague David Roberts pointed out coming up with new technologies is indeed a key aspect of fighting climate change but for Republicans it may be a way to head off more ambitious climate policies. Already momentum is building in the House for taxing carbon as well as a Green New Deal to fight climate change. During the hearing Democrats revealed some of their strategy to pressure the EPA on climate change going forward. Since they lost seats in the Senate Democrats emphasized key state level disputes like the fight between California and the EPA over fuel economy standards. Vehicles are a huge source of greenhouse gas emissions and California wants to retain its authority to set tighter emissions rules than the rest of the country. The Trump administration wants one standard for the country as well as a much more relaxed fuel economy target than the one proposed under President Obama. Lawmakers from both sides also lamented the ongoing partial government shutdown. Most of the EPAs 13000 employees are furloughed but some are still on the job to deal with responses to disasters like the fallout from Californias wildfires last year. Some employees were also recalled to help the EPA meet court ordered deadlines for producing environmental regulations. Under these circumstances its not possible for EPA to do its mission said Sen. Ben Cardin D MD. I want to underscore how tragic this shutdown is.	False	False	False	False	False
Lab grown meat has been successfully cultured in space for the first time. The Israeli food technology startup Aleph Farms grew the meat on the International Space Station 248 miles 399 km away from any natural resources. Bovine cells were harvested on Earth and taken to space where they were grown into small scale muscle tissue using a 3D bioprinter. The method relies on mimicking a natural process of muscle tissue regeneration occurring inside a cows body. The experiment took place on 26 September on the Russian segment of the space station and involved the assembly of small scale muscle tissue in a 3D bioprinter under controlled microgravity conditions. In future the technique could be used to provide meat for people living on the space station. The development marks a further step forward for a nascent industry that aims to provide people with real meat without the environmental impact and welfare problems of intensive livestock production. In December Aleph Farms announced it had produced a prototype strip of steak grown from cells in the lab in two weeks although it admitted the taste needed to be improved. We are proving that cultivated meat can be produced anytime anywhere in any condition said Didier Toubia co founder and chief executive of Aleph Farms. We can potentially provide a powerful solution to produce the food closer to the population needing it at the exact and right time it is needed. In space we dont have 10000 or 15000 litres of water available to produce 1kg of beef added Toubia. This joint experiment marks a significant first step toward achieving our vision to ensure food security for generations to come while preserving our natural resources. Recent scientific studies have found that huge reductions in meat eating are essential in order to cut greenhouse gas emissions and avoid dangerous climate change. One found that avoiding meat and dairy products was the single biggest way to reduce an individuals environmental impact on the planet.	False	False	False	False	False
The New York Times has taken warnings about global warming to a whole new level publishing a three part series suggesting a potential apocalypse from melting ice sheets if humans keep pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. If that ice sheet were to disintegrate it could raise the level of the sea by more than 160 feet a potential apocalypse depending on exactly how fast it happened NYT reporter Justin Gillis wrote of what some scientists predict could happen to Antarctica. Gillis points to recent research suggesting the collapse of the ice sheet will become inevitable likening the projected 160 foot sea level rise to flood stories from the Epic of Gilgamesh tothe Bibles Old Testament. In the Epic of Gilgamesh waters so overwhelm the mortals that the gods grow frightened too Gillis wrote In Indias version Lord Vishnu warns a man to take refuge in a boat carrying seeds. In the Bible God orders Noah to carry two of every living creature on his ark. I dont think the biblical deluge is just a fairy tale Terence Hughes a retired glaciologist told Gillis. I think some kind of major flood happened all over the world and it left an indelible imprint on the collective memory of mankind that got preserved in these stories. That flooding would have occurred at the end of the last ice age Gillis reported. Of course he left out the part about Antarctic ice sheet melting taking place over a couple thousands years. Now the research Gillis points to is a worst scenario based on a Parallel Ice Sheet Model as reported by scientists in a 2015 study. Models can be useful tools to test complex climate interactions but they are still projections not facts. That 2015 study found half the Antarctic ice sheet would melt or fall into the sea in the first thousand years based on model projections according to a previous NYT report. The first installment of Gilliss three part series claimed Antarctica may have entered the early stages of an unstoppable disintegration but later in the series admitted the glacier NYT reporters toured with scientists seems stable now. Even so the effects of any current global warming on Antarctica are unclear. The South Poles western ice sheet has been shedding mass for decades but part of that has to do with underground volcanic activity and the fact the ice sheet rests on water. Recent evidence suggests the Antarctic peninsula has been cooling since the late 1990s. A recent study found the region has shifted from a warming trend of 0.32 Cdecade during 19791997 to a cooling trend of 0.47 Cdecade during 19992014. Antarcticas eastern ice sheet seems more stable and may have even been gaining mass in recent decades. A 2015 study by NASA found Antarcticas ice sheet increased in mass from 1992 to 2008. The study found ice gains in Eastern Antarctica offset ice loss from the west.

Upside down rivers of warm ocean water may be one of the causes of Antarctica's ice shelves breaking up leading to a rise in sea levels. A new study suggests that in the past increases in Antarctic sea ice in colder climates may have contributed to ice ages. Using computer simulations the research looked at past changes during the glacial periods and noted that previous increases in sea ice levels may have significantly altered the circulation of the ocean which led to a reverse greenhouse effect as carbon dioxide levels in the ocean increased and levels in the air decreased. One key question in the field is still what caused the Earth to periodically cycle in and out of ice ages University of Chicago professor and the study's co author Malte Jansen said in a statement. We are pretty confident that the carbon balance between the atmosphere and ocean must have changed but we dont quite know how or why. ANTARCTICA'S ICE SHEETS CONTAIN RADIOACTIVE CHLORINE GAS 60 YEARS AFTER NUCLEAR TESTS STUDY SAYS The last major ice age ended at the end of the Pleistocene epoch about 11700 years ago as glaciers have periodically grown and then gotten smaller. Researchers believe that changes to the Earth's orbit may be partly responsible for some of the Earth's cooling but additional factors have likely played a part Jensen added. The most plausible explanation is that there was some change in how carbon was divided between the atmosphere and the ocean Jansen continued. Theres no shortage of ideas about how this happens but its not quite clear how they all fit together. Researchers also believe a mini ice age may have occurred roughly 12800 years ago. It likely stems from an asteroid impact that rocked the Northern Hemisphere and led to the Younger Dryas climate event. Jansen pointed out that the Southern Ocean around Antarctica plays a key role in ocean circulation due to the deep waters in the region leading it to have outsized consequences. AIR POLLUTION MORE DEADLY THAN SMOKING NEW STUDY FINDS What this suggests is that its a feedback loop said the study's lead author Alice Marzocchi. As the temperature drops less carbon is released into the atmosphere which triggers more cooling. What surprised me is how much of this increased storage can be attributed to physical changes alone with Antarctic sea ice cover being the key player Marzocchi added noting that future study of the ocean and the role it plays in the carbon cycle can help simulate future environmental change. The research has been published in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience.

PresidentDonald Trumpproclaimed himself an 'environmentalist' Monday after missing a climate changediscussion on Monday with other world leaders at the G7 summit in Biarritz France. At a press conference the president said he knows 'more about the environment than most people' in part due to his time as a builder when environmental concerns often pose last minute roadblocks to a project. At a summit where relentless fires in the Amazon provided a backdrop Trump did not respond directly when asked if he still harbored doubts about global warming vouching for his environmental credentials by pointing to numerous environmental impact statements he has been involved with. 'I went the cleanest water on earth. I want to cleanest air on earth. And that's what we're doing. I'm an environmentalist' Trump told reporters at the end of the summit. 'A lot of people don't understand that I have done more environmental impact statements probably than anybody that's I guess I can say definitely because I've done many many many of them. More than anybody that's ever been president or vice president or anything even close to president. And I think I know more about the environment than most people' he said. Trump was referencing his time as a builder when an environmental review is part of the construction process. Although he steered clear of the global warming debate after long expressing doubts Trump touted the value of U.S. oil and liquified national gas reserves and called for new infrastructure to harness it. He said the domestic industry is creating 'tremendous wealth and LNG is being sought over all over Europe and all over the world.' 'Im not going to lose that wealth. Im not going to lose it on dreams on windmills which frankly arent working too well' Trump said once again taking a shot at a growing renewable energy source. 'I want clean air. I want clean water I want a wealthy country. I want a spectacular country with jobs with pensions with so many things and that's what we're getting so I want to be very careful at the same time at the same time it's very important to me very important to me we have to maintain this incredible this incredible place that we've all built. We've become much richer country and that's a good thing not a bad thing because that great wealth allows us to take care of people' Trump said. He concluded his remarks with some environmental boosterism. 'We can take care of people that we couldn't afford taking care of the past because of the great wealth we can't let that wealth is taken away clean air clean water thank you very much everybody I appreciate it thank you' he concluded. Trump was scheduled to attend the session on climate biodiversity and oceans but his chair remained empty while other leaders pledged a modest 20 million to help put out fires that are raging across wide swaths of the Amazon jungles in Brazil. 'He wasnt in the room but his team was there' French President Emmanuel Macron said. The White House attributed his absence to scheduled one on one meetings that he attended withIndia's Prime Minister Narendra Modi andGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel both of whom managed to attend. 'The President had scheduled meetings and bilaterals with Germany and India so a senior member of the Administration attended in his stead' White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told DailyMail.com and other news outlets. A White House official said the stand in was an aide from the National Security Council. Trump started the morning behind schedule. His meeting with Merkel was delayed about two hours. Asked about the global warming meeting during a photo op with Merkel the president said 'Were having it in a little while.' He had no reply to a journalist who informed him that it was already underway. During his meeting with Modi Trump said that he wants 'clean air and clean water' but made no comment about his decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord. He did offer however that the climate change discussion would be his next stop. That never materialized. Trump is a climate change skeptic who once claimed it was a hoax invented by the Chinese. United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said Monday that the world faces 'a dramatic climate emergency.' He will ask leaders at a Sept. 23 summit in New York to agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than they promised in the 2015 Paris agreement. Guterres said Monday that 'we are much worse than we were during Paris ... and so it's absolutely essential that countries commit themselves to increase what was promised.' Guterres claimed that Greenland's ice cap was melting 'dramatically' and that 2015 through 2019 were 'the five hottest years on record.'	False	False	False	False	False
WASHINGTON The Environmental Protection Agency is drawing heat for pulling its scientists from a paneldiscussion Monday in Rhode Island as part of a conference spotlighting the effects of climate change on the Narragansett Bay. The withdrawal of the two scientists as well as an agency consultanthas sparked fresh criticism about EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt'sskepticism toward the broad scientific community's conclusion that human caused global warming is a proven fact and a growing concern. The conference where the scientists were scheduled to speak coincidedwith the release of a report showing the threats of climate change to NarragansettBay the 196 square mile estuary whose watershed encompasses 1705 square miles with more than100towns and cities that are home to nearly 2 million people. Climate change is affecting air and water temperatures precipitation sea level and fish in the Narragansett Bay region the report which was partially funded by the EPAconcludes. Narragansett Bay is one of 28 estuaries that make up the National Estuary Program an EPA program designed to protect and restore the water quality and ecological integrity of estuaries of national significance. Rhode Island's two U.S. senators Democrats Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse criticized the EPA's decision during an appearance Monday at the conference in Providence R.I. This has traditionally been a bipartisan issue Whitehouse said citing former Rhode Island GOP Sen. John Chafee's role establishing the estuaryprogram. So there is no reason for it to have to be this way. And it should not take away from the terrific scientific work that is being done because at the heart of all this is not the politics its the knowledge. Reed said he was disheartened and disappointed that the EPA scientists were not allowed to publicly present their findings. This type of political interference or scientific censorship whatever you want to call it is ill advised and does a real disservice to the American peopleand public health. Scientific evidenceand input iscrucial to policy efforts. It informs decision makers. We can debate the issues we can have different viewpointsbut we should all be able to objectively examine the data and look at the evidence ... Now is not the time to turn a blind eye to what science is telling us that climate change and other factors are influencing the health of this estuary ... I hope the Trump administration will look at the facts read this report and reconsider its stance on trying to muzzle scientists who present evidence that doesn't conform to their political agenda. The EPA has not responded to a request for comment. Agency spokesmanJohn Konkus told The Washington Postin an email Sunday that EPA scientists are attending they simply are not presenting it is not an EPA conference. The agency officials initially scheduled to speak during the conference areAutumn Oczkowski a research ecologist at the EPAs National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory Atlantic Ecology Division in Rhode Island andRose Martin a postdoctoral fellow at the same EPAlaboratory according to The New York Times which first reported the story. Emily Shumchenia an EPAconsultant was also scheduled to take part in an afternoon panel titled The Present and Future Biological Implications of Climate Change.

CNN just posted an article about rising sea levels. Its good to know that the editors are much smarter than President Donald Trump or his equally climate denying Environmental Protection Agency Commissioner Scott Pruitt. The EPA matters because climate change is right up there with the national debt as a threat to national security. The DoD in a recent report says that rising sea levels will put more than a thousand military installations in serious jeopardy. But CNN is wrong in their projections. Ive just returned from Antarctica on a research trip to validate the most likely temperature and sea level rise projections in the ClyFy novel Im writing. 3F of average temperature increase and three feet of sea level rise by 2050. The scientists all agreed these were plausible. I commented Two feet by 2100? Get real. 3 feet by 2050. Talk to me after Cat 6 hurricanes blanket the Caribbean every year. Last year was just a preview. Pay attention CNN. Sea level rise is accelerating. One witty Facebook user quipped I will be dead by that time so who cares? I thought he was being sarcastic but he turned out to be dead serious. And there you have it. This is why deniers exist. They dont want to spend their own money to solve a problem that might affect their grandkids and not themselves. Its pure unadulterated selfishness. They cant accept the truth of that so they deny the science of climate change. The equation that is most dangerous according to Jeffrey Kluger of Time is n1 otherwise stated as If it matters to me it counts. If not I dont give a damn. Trump and Pruitt and others of their ilk might have greed and corruption as motives. But n1 applies to them too.	False	False	False	False	False
Madrid AFP A UN climate summit in Madrid was on life support Saturday after marathon negotiations between countries left them more divided than ever over on how to fight global warming and pay for its ravages. Diplomats from rich nations emerging giants and the world's poorest countries each for their own reasons found fault with a draft agreement put forward by host Chile in a botched attempt to strike common ground. Faced with fire alarm warnings from science deadly extreme weather made worse by climate change and weekly strikes by millions of young people negotiations in Madrid were under pressure to send a clear signal that governments were willing to double down in tackling the crisis. But the 12 day talks more than 24 hours after their scheduled end had retreated even further from this goal on Saturday. Simon Stiell Grenada envoy told AFP that the lack of ambition in the initial agreement text was crazy. It isn't reflective of the kids who are demonstrating on the streets the world over communities being washed away by rising sea levels he said late Saturday. We wanted provisions that were in the Paris agreement to remain and what we see at every COP it just seems to be another opportunity to erode those. Veteran observers of UN climate talks were stunned by the state of play nearly 24 hours after the negotiations had been due to close. I have never seen such a disconnect between what the science requires and the people of the world demand versus what the climate negotiations are delivering Alden Meyer strategy and policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists told AFP. Alexandria Villasenor a 14 year old climate activist said she was disappointed in the lack of action at COP 25. The difference between the youth on the streets and the negotiations is that the youth on the streets are acting with urgency she told AFP. COP 25 has failed us and it's another year of failure. Under the Paris accord countries agreed in 2015 to work to limit global temperature rises to well below two degrees Celsius through a series of voluntary action pledges that step up over time. The push for a strengthening of voluntary carbon cutting plans is led by small island and least developed states along with the European Union. Ministers from this high ambition coalition have called out countries they see as blocking a consensus call for all countries to step up notably the United States Australia and Saudi Arabia. China and India the world's No. 1 and No. 4 carbon emitters have made it clear they see no need to improve on their current emissions reduction plans which run to 2030. These emerging giants have chosen instead to emphasise the historical responsibility of rich nations to lead the way and provide financing to poor countries. Observers told AFP Saturday evening that a possible landing ground had emerged in which China agreed to yield a little over language surrounding ambition in return for a clear reiteration of historic polluters' obligation to do more. The COP 25 summit was also meant to finalise a chapter on carbon markets in the Paris rulebook which goes into effect next year. Some nations notably Brazil and Australia want to count carbon credits accumulated under a previous climate deal as part of their commitments under the Paris goals further stymying progress. The United States which is leaving the landmark Paris climate deal next year was accused of acting as a spoiler on a number of issues vital to climate vulnerable nations. This included so called loss and damage funding to help disaster hit countries repair and rebuild. The US has not come here in good faith said Harjeet Singh climate lead with charity ActionAid. They continue to block the world's efforts to help people whose lives have been turned upside down by climate change. Even if nations in Madrid snatch victory from the jaws of defeat and agree to implement their pledges Earth is on course to warm more than 3C by 2100. If there was one time in the history when I would say governments fucked up I would say today in Madrid governments fucked up said Mohamed Adow Director of Power Shift Africa. People across the world must rise to save the planet.	False	False	False	False	False
