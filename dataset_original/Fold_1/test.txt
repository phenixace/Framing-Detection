The Trump administration has held the biggest lease sale of oil and gas in US history. Environmentalists fear the auction will massively expand fossil fuel production and could lead to the next Deepwater disaster. President Donald Trump on Wednesday sold more than 77 million acres of federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore oil drilling an area twice the size of Florida. The lease sale forms part of the Trump administrations plans to increase domestic energy production by opening up new areas for oil drilling. Oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico became increasingly controversial after the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010 which killed 11 workers and released millions of barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The catastrophe caused 17.2 billion worth of damage to natural resources according to a study in 2017 commissioned by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Critics of the sale fear the expansion in offshore drilling could devastate marine life and lead to roll backs in environmental protections. Trump is selling off our oceans and selling out coastal communities and marine life to the oil industry said Kristen Monsell oceans program legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity. More drilling and less regulation will make the next Deepwater Horizon disaster only a matter of time. Whales dolphins and Gulf seafood are already marinating in oil spills and industry wastewater she added. The Interior Department said the sell off is necessary if America is to maintain energy independence. American energy production can be competitive said Vincent DeVito an energy policy advisor at the Interior Department. People need jobs the Gulf Coast states need revenue and Americans do not want to be dependent on foreign oil. he said. The Gulf of Mexico provides the US with around 1.5 million barrels of oil per day or roughly 17 percent of its national production total according to the Energy Information Administration. US crude oil output has grown by more than 20 percent since mid 2016. The oil industry welcomed the lease sale with Randall Luthi of the trade group National Oceanic Industry Association noting that the sale on Wednesday may draw more interest from industry than we have seen in recent years. Meanwhile some NGOs have questioned the economic rationale behind the sale arguing that the way in which federal assets are sold off does not serve the best interests of US taxpayers. The Project on Government Oversight warned in February that the uncompetitive lease system used by the government to auction sites allows energy companies to secure offshore leases for a pittance. It cautioned that the sale in the Gulf of Mexico means more publicly owned resources could be turned over to industry at bargain basement prices. The Center for American Progress a left leaning policy think tank has echoed this statement saying in a statement that offering a nearly unrestricted supply in a low demand market with a cut rate royalty and almost no competition is bad policy and an inexcusable waste of taxpayer resources.

After watching Schwarzeneggers video in fact it becomes immediately evident that the actor and former politician has never read the Paris climate accordand has no idea what it says. President Trump says hes pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. My message to you Mr. President is that as a public servant and especially as a president your first and most important responsibility is to protect the people Schwarzenegger begins. He then proceeds to chronicle the negative effects of pollution in the United States. Two hundred thousand people die every year in the U.S. from air pollution and half of our rivers and streams are too polluted for our health he says. We cant sit back and just do nothing while people are getting sick and dying especially when you know theres another way. Schwarzenegger goes on to suggest that without the Paris accord we will face a dirty energy future with asthma emphysema and cancer. The trouble is President Trump would heartily agree with Schwarzeneggers point while perhaps debating the exact statistics. According to President Trump clean air and water are exactly the issues that the EPA should be dealing with. But this has nothing to do with the Paris climate accord. Nowhere does the 25 page agreement deal with battling air pollution or cleaning up rivers and streams. It deals specifically with reducing greenhouse gas emissions particularly carbon dioxide CO2 with the stated objective of combatting global warming. Carbon dioxide is not a toxic gas. No one is dying from CO2 air pollution or from rivers and streams polluted with carbon dioxide. Some climate scientists in fact have argued that more carbon dioxide not less would be beneficial to the environment and to humanity. Growers regularly pump it into their greenhouses to achieve healthier heartier plants. Everything Schwarzenegger mentions in his short videofrom air pollution to clean water to asthma emphysema and canceris completely unrelated to the Presidents decision to withdraw from the Paris accord. So maybe the next time he decides to criticize the decision to get the U.S. out of the Paris accord he should read the document first. Meanwhile he should probably think about terminating that video.

California Gov. Jerry Brown ramped up his criticism of President Trump in an interview that aired Monday calling the president a saboteur in the fight to combat climate change and saying that somethings got to happen to this guy. Speaking to MSNBCs Andrea Mitchell at an environmentalsummitin San Francisco last week Brown tore into Trump for the presidents controversial tweets about the death toll in Puerto Rico from last years Hurricane Maria and urged voters to vote for Democrats in Novembers midterm elections in an effort to thwart Trumps agenda. We never had a president who was engaged in this kind of behavior Brown said. I mean hes not telling the truth he keeps changing his mind hes sabotaging the world order in many respects. Brown added Its unprecedented its dangerous and hopefully this election is going to send a strong message to the country the Democrats will winsomethings got to happen to this guy because if we dont get rid of him hes going to undermine America and even the world. Under Brown California has become one of the main opponents to the Trump administrations policies on everything from land use to immigration. But there is perhaps no area where California has been more combative against the White House agenda than the environment. California has positioned itself as the center of the Trump resistance Jessica Levinson a clinical law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles told Fox News. Its bloody combat. Earlier this month Brown signed two pieces of legislation effectively banning the construction of any new offshore oil and gas pipelines in the states waters. The new laws are meant to thwart a Trump plan to open nearly 1.7 billion acres of coastal waters to drilling. Shortly before the climate conference began last week the governor also put his signature on legislation phasing out electricity in the state produced by fossil fuels by 2045. Its really extraordinary that the president can deny science like that Brown told MSNBC of Trumps questioning the veracity of climate change. Its bad and how we counteract it is with a climate summit with normal people respecting the truth and communicating that with other normal people and combating the President of the United States in what are lies distortions and quite frankly bizarre behavior. Browns criticism of Trump appears to have fallen on deaf ears at the White House as the administration announced on Tuesday that it was rolling back an Obama era rule meant to curb climate changing pollution and easing restrictions on energy companies that allow huge volumes of natural gas to escape after drilling it from U.S. lands. The move rescinds much of a 2016 rule adopted under President Barack Obama that forced energy companies to capture methane a key contributor to climate change. The replacement rule from the Interior Department does not have the same mandates for companies to reduce gas pollution. It comes a week after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed weakening a similar rule for emissions from public and private lands. We're for clean air and water but at the same time we're for reasonable regulations Deputy Interior Secretary David Bernhardt told reporters. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

That was the sober but urgent warning from congressional Democrats who on Tuesday penned a letter to EPA head Scott Pruitt urging him to preserve the Great Lakes area office amid rumors it could be shuttered as part of the Trump administrations efforts to slash the EPAs budget. EPA Region 5 is critical to protecting the air drinking water and health of residents in the six Great Lakes states the region serves and closing its headquarters in Chicago would make EPA less efficient and effective in its efforts to protect human health and the environment read the letter. And in a visit last week to East Chicago Indianawhich is grappling with a lead contamination crisis affecting both the water and soil Pruitt reportedly denied to a resident of the town that Region 5 was on the chopping block. About a month ago the union got three press calls in the same day asking if it had heard there was announcement Region 5 might be closed. The Office of Management and Budget also issued a memo in March asking the EPA to propose two regions for elimination. Then two weekends ago Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel issued a statement in support of keeping Region 5 open following reports in the Chicago Sun Timesand Politico that it was on the chopping block. There are about 1000 people in Region 5 and it has the most industrial regions of all of the EPA the employee who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal told HuffPost. My question is Why us? Were a big region in terms of geography. It takes four hours flying to get to the edge of the whole region. There are a lot of folks who simply wont do the move. And to be honest thats why its being suggested the employee said. The Trump administration suggested getting rid of 31 percent of the budget about 3000 employees which is about 20 percent of the EPA workforce. How are they going to get there? Its a lot easier to combine regions knowing that many of the staff in Region 5 would not want to move to Kansas City. Members of Congress who signed Tuesdays letter underscored the important role the region plays in ensuring a quick response to spills and contamination in the six states which are criss crossed with oil and gas pipelines spills often near the bulk of the nations freshwater supply and the Mississippi River waterways. Mikulka the EPA employees union president said shuttering Region 5 would be an effective way to hobble an agency whose mission is largely at odds with the Trump administrations deregulation orientedanti climate protection stance. If we have the most industry and we do the most enforcement and get the greatest results what better way to disembowel the EPA than going after Region 5?	True	True	False	True	False
If we dont address the issues of climate change and inequality Ms. Lagarde said Tuesday before a major economic conference in Riyadh we will be moving to a dark future. Speaking directly to the question of global warming Lagarde said that we will be toasted roasted and grilled if humanity fails to make critical decisions regarding carbon emissions. If the human race wants a future that looks like utopia and not dystopia it needs to address such concerns Lagarde said predicting that in 50 years time oil will be a secondary commodity since green energy will have moved into prominence. Speaking before a major petroleum producing nation Lagarde hastened to add that these necessary measures are well understood in Saudi Arabia. Ms. Lagarde is no stranger to exaggerated predictions having proposed in 2016 that a Brexit victory would lead to 500000 job losses while suggesting that Brexit voters are narrow minded and calling for a united Europe. Ms. Lagarde said she had always admired Britains openness to other nationalities and cultures and added it was hard to believe attitudes had changed in such a short space of time. In June President Donald Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord arguing that it was a deeply flawed document that put American workers at an economic disadvantage. This announcement drew fierce criticism from world leaders and activists with former UN secretary general Ban Ki moon accusing Trump of standing on the wrong side of history. Recent reports however suggest that Trumps move has drawn numerous countries in his wake with a number of other nations quietly withdrawing from the Paris energy goals. According to Lawrence Solomon of Energy Probe a Toronto based environmental organization Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is one of the only signers of the Paris agreement who is actually abiding by the exacting demands of the accord. Most signatories Solomon notes in an essay in last Fridays Financial Post are ignoring if not altogether abandoning Paris commitments undoubtedly because voters in large part put no stock in scary global warming scenarios. Moreover a devastating new study from the prestigious UK based Lancet journal has revealed that pollution related diseasesrather than climate changewere responsible for an estimated 9 million premature deaths in 2015 or some 15 times more than from all wars and other forms of violence combined. Pollution is not only the largest environmental cause of disease and premature death in the world today the study found but diseases caused by pollution were responsible for roughly 16 percent of all deaths worldwide three times more deaths than from AIDS tuberculosis and malaria combined and 15 times more than from all wars and other forms of violence. So while there has not yet been a single documented case of a person being killed by carbon dioxide related global warming real pollution of air water and land is killing an average of 25000 people every day across the globe. As environmental activists jet around the world complaining of carbon footprints and preaching renewable energy they have been remarkably silent regarding the real and present menace that is wiping out millions of human beings around the world. Whereas the Paris Climate Accord prates about greenhouse gas emissions it never once mentions the word pollution in the entire 27 pagedocument. Yet not only is pollution control not getting better in many parts of the world pollution is getting worse the Lancet study found.	True	True	False	True	False
More and more Americans are coming to the conclusion that climate change is no myth at a time when the Trump administration is intent on ignoring reality and appeasing corporate interests. Some environmental leaders are responding by formulating a lowest common denominator strategy on climate like revenue neutral approaches hoping to magically create a middle ground by bowing to the altar of limited government. Fortunately an inclusive inter sectional and organic resistance is rising. This spring throughout a week of powerful demonstrations from Earth Day to May Day this resistance will blossom. OneAmerica is a multi issue immigrant rights organization that calls Washington state aka the Center of the Resistance home. Our communities are as harmed in the short term by ICE raids and unconstitutional travel bans as they are in the long term by gutted environmental regulations. To fight these destructive and unpopular attacks we need everyone but more importantly we need to follow the leadership of those most impacted by these regulatory rollbacks and programmatic cuts. People across the country overwhelmingly support action on climate and investment in renewable energy sources and believe immigrants make the United States a better place to live. In partnership with our allies among labor environmental faith and progressive business groups OneAmerica has worked with other organizations led by people of color to build a statewide movement for action on climate change that puts our communities and other front line communities first. Our communities to quote environmental justice advocate Majora Carter are the canaries in the coal mine We have already begun to experience climate disruption by virtue of where we live and work and we have always been on the front lines of pollution. Farm worker communities in Eastern Washington have worked through several severely hot summers under threat of wildfires and job loss due to drought. In the Puget Sound region some of the zip codes with the lowest life expectancy and highest pollution burdens are home to large and growing Latino and Asian Pacific American communities. Our movement has come together around the conviction that a well crafted climate policy must actively seek to close that climate gap the disproportionate and unequal impact of the climate crisis has on people of color and poor people. We demand climate action that addresses historic injustices by pricing pollution and investing in solutions that improve economic and environmental conditions in front line communities. Our policy developed in partnership with mainstream environmental groups labor unions public health organizations and other stakeholders represents some of the best of what a unified national resistance could create Comprehensive equitable action against the biggest existential threat of our generation climate change. Thats why on Saturday April 22nd we will support an inclusive March for Science that embraces research based policies to address climate change. We will push our allies in the movement to use racial equity in their analyses by identifying disparate impacts of pollution and climate disruption and designing remedies that improve conditions for the most overburdened first. The Peoples Climate Movement takes to the streets on Saturday April 29th shedding light on the intertwined destinies of clean energy and employment in the United States and around the world. Finally on May Day OneAmerica will join partner organizations in championing immigrant and workers rights in Seattle and Yakima in solidarity with mobilizations across the country. We will march to demand inter sectional immigrant rights The right to freedom from hate crimes and harassment the right to living wages and safe working conditions the right to love whomever we choose the right to keep families together and the right to a clean and healthy environment. These are the inextricable demands of a resistance as powerful as it is diverse and as strong as it is resilient. Our hope rests not in convincing the willfully ignorant to change their ways but in the coming together of broad based peoples movements prepared to act to take back the initiative moving from resistance to power.

A tiny endangered butterfly could stop President Donald Trump from building his beloved border wall. A lawsuit has been filed by the Center for Biological Diversityenvironmental groups and the State of California against theU.S. Department of Homeland Security. It outlines that the Quino checkerspot butterfly Riverside fairy shrimp and the Pacific pocket mouse will be threatened if the border wall is built. The butterfly which is native to southern California and Northern Mexico is already on the endangered species list. The lawsuit contends that the Department of Homeland Security does not have the ability to waive environmental laws requiring review before building the wall. The suit seeks a ruling that a border wall with Mexico must go through normal environmental reviews which could block construction or at least cause major delays. The challengers contend that authority to waive the environmental reviews falls under a 2005 law which has expired. 'The Trump administration can't use an expired waiver to bypass crucial environmental protections to build these destructive projects' Brian Segee a senior attorney at CBDtold San Diego TV stationKGTV. 'It's time to stop Trump's hateful bombast and his executive overreach here in San Diego before it goes any further. The law and the Constitution are firmly on our side and we think the judge will agree.' The DHS is arguing that it is within its right to issue the waivers citing a 1996 immigration law. The case was set to be heard on Friday in San Diego by US DistrictJudge Gonzalo Curiel. Curiel came to national attention in 2016 when he was presiding over one of the cases against Trump University. Trump said that he was biased because of his 'Mexican Heritage' and Trump's stance on the border. At the time he told CNN'We are building a wall. He's a Mexican. We're building a wall between here and Mexico.' Now Curiel will be hearing a case about the wall. On Friday he heard two and a half hours of arguments and saidthat he was leaning toward deciding he has jurisdiction in a lawsuit that alleges the Trump administration overreached in waiving laws that require environmental and other reviews. The administration argues he doesn't have jurisdiction. Curiel asked the administration and wall opponents to file additional briefings by the end of Tuesday.	True	True	False	True	True
Global warming is partially responsible for a decades old oil spill that happened after an Exxon Mobil tanker hit a barrier reef according to a Los Angeles Times report funded in part by liberal billionaire George Soros. The LA Times published a wide ranging piece Thursday suggesting climate change laid the groundwork for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill a disaster that eventually dumped more than 10 million gallons of crude off the coast of Alaska. Higher than normal water temperatures near Prince William Sound caused ice bergs to chip off the Columbia Glacier and force the ship into uncharted territory. Floating chunks of ice forced the tanker out of its primary shipping lane the paper noted. It veered off and crashed into the Bligh Reef causing Exxon more than 3.4 billion through 2008 in cleanup costs and court settlements. Columbia Journalism Schools Energy and Environment Reporting Project the group that conducted the papers report was also involved in an investigation last November targeting Exxons climate change research. Thursdays report dovetails with the groups previous investigations showing the oil company hid knowledge about climate change from the public for years. For the two decades following the Exxon Valdez disaster the company worked quietly to safeguard its operations and infrastructure against steadily rising sea levels and thawing permafrost The LA Times wrote. Yet in public it vociferously fought regulations and policies that would have limited fossil fuel emissions while publicly questioning the science behind climate change. Some climate scientists believe the LA Times is taking a leap of faith. Roy Spencer a climate scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville for one told The Daily Caller News Foundation that ice always calves off glaciers because snow falls on the mountains and the ice flows downhill no global warming needed. There is a perfectly reasonable explanation for why ice bergs were cleaving off glaciers at the time of the Valdez disaster he said and it doesnt really have anything to do with man made global warming. If the Columbia Glacier was calving more in the 1980s its most likely because the Pacific Decadal Oscillation PDO flipped in the late 1970s which caused it to suddenly warm in Alaska Spencer added referencing an El Nino like weather pattern that commonly affects the area the oil spill. What happened to the Valdez is no different than what happened to the Titanic he said referring to the passenger ship that hit an iceberg in 1912 which killed thousands of people heading to New York from England. Several wealthy philanthropic groups such as the Rockefeller Brothers Fund RBF Rockefeller Family Fund RFF and the Open Society Foundations bankrolled large portions of the LA Times report. Soros is the director and founder of Open Society and has financed climate crusades in the past. RFF has single handedly financially propped up the anti Exxon campaign. It also pressured various attorneys general into investigating Exxon namely for the purposes of bringing the company up on racketeering charges. The only way to target Exxon for hiding climate change research was to request the New York AGs office to open an investigation into the company David Kaiser and Lee Wasserman directors of RFFwrote in an editorialfor New York Books. The LA Times for its part has failed in the past to disclose itsties with RFF. Wassermanwrote an op edin January for the California paper fleshing out specifics about the probes into Exxons climate research. The paper disclosed the Wassermans financial contributions to the investigation but falsely suggested RFF had nothing to do with the investigations. TheFund has made grants to the Columbia Journalism Schools Energy and Environment Reporting Project and InsideClimate News but hasno involvement in articles they produce the papers disclosure notes. The disclosure implies RFF did not actively participate in the investigations which were first reported by environmental media group InsideClimate News and the LA Times last November.

Glamour Rep. John Shimkus R Ill. long a climate change denier who in the past has relied on Bible verses to make his case argued against the Green New Deal at a House hearing on Wednesday. Moments after he started speaking Wednesday morning before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce Rep. John Shimkus R Ill. urged Democrats to accept that proposing top down government requirements to rapidly decarbonize the U.S. and global economies may not be the most realistic way to address the climate change problem. We should be open to the fact that wealth transfer schemes suggested in the radical policies like the Green New Deal may not be the best path said Shimkus who less than a decade ago deployed Bible verses to dismiss the realities of climate science. Two congressional hearings on Wednesday morning the first science based discussions in the House focused on climate change in years did little to move the needle on a long stagnant policy debate on how to keep global warming from reaching temperatures with catastrophic consequences. But GOP opposition to a Green New Deal the grassroots effort to dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions that has energized activists for months was on full display. Once a vague term for clean energy stimulus the Green New Deal re emergedin the political discourse in mid 2018. A cadre of left wing Democratic candidates began using it to describe plans to spend trillions of dollars on a national industrial strategy to zero out fossil fuel emissions and power the country with 100 percent renewables in a decade. The proposals electrified a static debate that too often ranged from outright denialism of climate change by some to dubious market fixes offered by others. Scientists quickly praised the idea of a Green New Deal as the first policy on the scale of the climate crisis. In November newly elected Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D N.Y. positioned herself as the champion of the Green New Deal movement. After failing to persuade House Democratic leaders to establish a select committee on a Green New Deal she began work on a sweeping new resolution outlining a transformative policy to guarantee high wage clean energy jobs to millions of Americans and upgrade the nations crumbling infrastructure to withstand already unavoidable extreme weather and sea level rise. Despite years of partisan bickering over the realities of climate change the idea proved popular. Eighty one percent of registered voters said they supported the main goals of the Green New Deal in a poll released in December. That included 64 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of self described conservative Republicans. Last month another poll found a narrow majority of voters said they supported a Green New Deal even if it required raising taxes to fund it. Rich Powell the executive director of the conservative clean energy advocacy group ClearPath complained that the emissions projected to come from new coal fired plants in other countries particularly India and China would completely offset the climate benefits of the U.S. completely decarbonizing. As HuffPost reported on Tuesday the Green New Deal resolution Ocasio Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey D Mass. are expected to unveil this week does just that calling on the nation to promote the international exchange of technology expertise products funding and services with the aim to reclaim U.S. leadership on climate change to help other countries achieve a Green New Deal. You only have to be 25 years old to be a member of Congress. We have young people that bring a lot of great qualities but maybe they dont bring a lot of life experience he said. I guess I can understand if someone has not had a lot of life experience and theyre proposing something thats extremely unrealistic well impossible. Impossible. What I dont understand is adults and grownups who are older and more mature who are also advocating something thats impossible he added referring to several of the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls. Rep. Louie Gohmert R Texas resorted to misrepresenting the Green New Del proposal in arguing against it. He said he and other Republicans have real concerns about shuttering military bases around the globe and cutting military spending by 50 percent proposals floated not by any congressional Democrats in the climate change debate but by Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein in 2016. Gohmert told panel witness Rev. Lennox Yearwood president of the national nonprofitHip Hop Caucus that he found it interesting at the activist would support a Green New Deal given Yearwoods previous service as an officer in the U.S. Air Force Reserve Chaplain Corps.

According to Lawrence Solomon of Energy Probe a Toronto based environmental organization Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is one of the only signers of the Paris agreement who is actually abiding by the exacting demands of the accord. Meanwhile Solomon notes in an essay in Fridays Financial Post most signatories are ignoring if not altogether abandoning Paris commitments undoubtedly because voters in large part put no stock in scary global warming scenarios. Trudeau now stands almost alone in sincere support of Paris Solomon writes. The populist backlash a revulsion at top down governments laden with jet setting politicians landing in posh places to preach restraint to the masses has swept America with Trumps election Great Britain with Brexit much of Europe and Australia. In the process global warming enthusiasts are being swept out he writes. Last week Australia rejected its Clean Energy Target CET a lengthy proposal that would have forced electricity utilities to rely on renewables and other low emission sources for a substantial percentage of their production. The measure had been put forward as a way of complying with requirements of the non binding Paris agreement. Earlier this month the prominent Australian economist Judith Sloan wrote a scathing essay decrying renewable energy as the greatest scam being perpetrated against taxpayers and consumers greater even than Ponzi Madoffor Enron. While sinking enormous financial resources into propping up renewable energy prospectors national governments are providing no perceptible benefits to their citizens Sloan wrote. With very few exceptions governments all over the world have fallen into the trap of paying renewable energy scammers on the basis that it is necessary at least politically to be seen to be doing something about climate change Sloan writes before providing readers with an avalanche of economic data to back up her assertion. Apparently Sloans arguments and those of like minded analysts prevailed on policy makers and the country rejected the CET with its taxpayer funded subsidizing of renewables. A second blow to disciples of the Paris Climate Accord was last weeks Austrian election Solomon argues which saw two conservative parties with no interest in climate change it wasnt even an election issue come in first and second making them likely to form a pro carbon coalition government. Germany too which has been a staunch proponent of anti climate change regulations has fallen hopelessly behind in meeting its carbon targets according to a leak. The current state of affairs has not only undermined Germanys climate policy but also jeopardizes Germanys international reputation as a climate leader Solomon asserts. According to the analyst popular opinion against German Chancellor Angela Merkels Energiewende energy transition policies which had doubled electricity prices played no small part in Merkels terrible showing in last months national elections. Costs of the ill fated Energiewende now total some 650 billion a bill that weighs heavily on the shoulders of German taxpayers. Late last year to their national embarrassment the Germans had to be bailed out of a small energy crisis by Poland when the wind failed to blow for several days and a thick fog surrounded many parts of Germany driving the output from renewables to just 4 percent of total demand. It was coal fueled Poland that had to rescue Germany from its self induced energy crisis. Merkel may now be unable to form a government without the support of the libertarian Free Democratic Party which demands an end to renewables subsidies Solomon notes. And so around the worldexcept in Trudeaus Canadanations are once again turning back to inexpensive coal rather than pouring more money into costly renewables and coal plants are being built at five times the rate that old plants are being decommissioned. This quiet revolution may simply be a welcome return to common sense and realism. After all once the photo ops are finished and the politically correct accords are duly signed amidst solemn brow furling political leaders must get back to the business of meeting the real needs of their citizenswhich all depend on the availability of affordable energy.

A United Nations special climate report suggests a tax on carbon dioxide emissions would need to be as high as 27000 per ton at the end of the century to effectively limit global warming. For Americans thats the same as a 240 per gallon tax on gasoline in the year 2100 should such a recommendation be adopted. In 2030 the report says a carbon tax would need to be as high as 5500 thats equivalent to a 49 per gallon gas tax. If you think thats an unlikely scenario youre probably not wrong. However its what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes report released Sunday night sees as a policy option for reducing emissions enough to keep projected warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The IPCCs report is meant to galvanize political support for doubling down on the Paris climate accord ahead of a U.N. climate summit scheduled for December. The report calls for societal changes that are unprecedented in terms of scale in order to limit future global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius the stretch goal of the Paris accord. However the costs of meeting that goal are high based on the IPCCs own figures. RELATED Heres What The Media Wont Tell You About The U.N.s New Climate Report In order to effectively keep future warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius the IPCC says carbon taxes would need to range from 135 to 5500 per ton in 2030 245 to 13000 per ton in 2050 420 to 17000 per ton in 2070 and 690 to 27000 per ton in 2100. To meet the goals of the Paris accord which seeks to limit future warming to below 2 degrees Celsius the IPCC says carbon taxes would have range between 10 and 200 in 2030 and 160 and 2125 in 2100. Thats equivalent to a gas tax as high as 1.70 per gallon in 2030 to nearly 19 per gallon at the end of the century. Thats less onerous than limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius but still no walk in the park. California and many European countries have policies to price carbon dioxide emissions and mandate green energy including cap and trade systems and carbon taxes. But carbon prices under those systems are nowhere near where the IPCC says they need to be. The IPCC said the price of carbon would need to increase significantly when a higher level of stringency is pursued. However the groups report tacitly acknowledges the unlikelihood that governments will enact astronomical taxes on energy. While the price of carbon is central to prompt mitigation pathways compatible with 1.5 degree Celsius consistent pathways a complementary mix of stringent policies is required reads the IPCCs report. In the U.S. Republican lawmakers overwhelmingly passed a resolution opposed to carbon taxes in July. Democrats called for a price on carbon dioxide in their 2016 party platform but they havent made much effort on that front since the failure of cap and trade legislation in 2010. Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo of Florida introduced carbon tax legislation shortly after all but five of his GOP colleagues in the House voted to oppose such a bill. Curbelos bill would tax carbon dioxide at 23 a ton nowhere near what the IPCC calls for. However the IPCC suggested a lower carbon tax could be used in conjunction with command and control policies like regulations and bans on coal plants could achieve generate a 1.5C pathway for the U.S. electric sector. But that point only serves to undermine Curbelos bill which would put a moratorium on some environmental regulations and possibly eliminate some if emissions goals are reached. The IPCC noted the literature indicates that the pricing of emissions is relevant but needs to be complemented with other policies to drive the required changes in line with 1.5C consistent cost effective pathways.

Former Vice President Al Gore said the Central American migrant caravan seeking asylum in the U.S. is a recent startling example of global warming forcing people from their homes. People from all over the world are being forced to migrate because the climate crisis is affecting their livelihood. The migrant caravan from Central America is a recent startling example Gore tweeted Monday. The migrant caravan made up of thousands of mostly young males from Honduras and other Central American countries arrived at the U.S. Mexico border in November seeking asylum. Migrants are fleeing violent corrupt countries with poor economies but some environmentalists and journalists claim global warming is also to blame. Gore pointed to a Financial Times video on climate change and the migrant caravan claiming that while most migrants are fleeing violence climate change is also playing a part based on an interview with a farmer turned migrant whos crop failed. The video published on Dec. 13 largely reflects arguments made by some media outlets in the past few months that migrant caravans to the U.S. are a preview of climate migrations meaning people driven from their homes due to global warming. Many experts who have seriously examined claims linking climate to violent conflict and mass migrations have found little evidence to support such claims but the media still applied the narrative by linking global warming to Central American migrations. Experts say that climate change in the region is exacerbating and sometimes causing a miasma of other problems including crop failures and povertyThe Guardian reported in October. And they warn that in the coming decades it is likely to push millions more people north towards the US the paper reported. Central American officials also claim global warming is part of the reason why their citizens are fleeing en mass. Governments say droughts have been made more frequent and intense by global warming. However the latest United Nations climate report in 2014 found low confidence in a global scale observed trend in drought or dryness lack of rainfall since the middle of the 20th century. The Guardian also noted that federal data showed a surge in outward migration from western Honduras a prime coffee producing area. The collapse in coffee bean prices has made growing it less profitable forcing migrants to hit the road.

The head of the Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that he will sign a new rule overriding the Clean Power Plan an Obama era effort to limit carbon emissions from coal fired power plants. The war on coal is over EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt declared in the coal mining state of Kentucky. For Pruitt getting rid of the Clean Power Plan will mark the culmination of a long fight he began as the elected attorney general of Oklahoma. Pruitt was among about two dozen attorney generals who sued to stop President Barack Obamas push to limit carbon emissions. Closely tied to the oil and gas industry in his home state Pruitt rejects the consensus of scientists that man man emissions from burning fossil fuels are the primary driver of global climate change. President Donald Trump who appointed Pruitt and shares his skepticism of established climate science promised to kill the Clean Power Plan during the 2016 campaign as part of his broader pledge to revive the nations struggling coal mines. In his order Tuesday Pruitt is expected to declare that the Obama era rule exceeded federal law by setting emissions standards that power plants could not reasonably meet. Appearing at an event with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Pruitt said The EPA and no federal agency should ever use its authority to say to you we are going to declare war on any sector of our economy. Obamas plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions. The Supreme Court put the plan on hold last year following legal challenges by industry and coal friendly states. Even so the plan helped drive a recent wave of retirements of coal fired plants which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power as well as state mandates promoting energy conservation. The withdrawal of the Clean Power Plan is the latest in a series of moves by Trump and Pruitt to dismantle Obamas legacy on fighting climate change including the delay or roll back of rules limiting levels of toxic pollution in smokestack emissions and wastewater discharges from coal burning power plants. The president announced earlier this year that he will pull the United States out of the landmark Paris climate agreement. Nearly 200 countries have committed to combat global warming by reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. Associated Press writer Michael Biesecker contributed to this report from Washington.	True	False	False	True	True
The cruelty and the idiocy of Donald Trumps presidency does not chiefly lie in his tweets or even his words. Trump the performer is ridiculous but thats the clown show that keeps many of us either terrified or entertained the real harm is elsewhere away from the blaring headlines. Trump has been most destructive in his willingness to carry out an unabashedly rightwing policy agenda. Most Republicans competing for the nomination in 2016 embraced their partys total capitulation to the fossil fuel industry denying the existence of climate change and promising to shred Environmental Protection Agency EPA regulations. This is a central threat to Americas future a major powerful political party rejecting science itself. This week the Trump administration said it would weaken federal clean water rules epa proposes big changes to federal water protections designed to protect millions of acres of wetlands and thousands of miles of streams from pesticide runoff and other pollutants. This proposal would not just undo Obama era regulations but chip away at protections instituted under the late George HW Bush perhaps the last major Republican to pay even lip service to the environment. The Obama era rule was designed to limit pollution in about 60 of the nations bodies of water protecting sources of drinking water for about a third of the United States. Federal authority was extended to limit pollution in large bodies of waters and smaller bodies that drain into them like streams and wetlands. Rural landowners complained about the government regulating how much pollution from chemical fertilizers and pesticides could seep into water on their property. Real estate developers and owners of golf courses attacked the water regulations too and cheered the news that Trump a fan of both real estate development and golf was delivering on a campaign promise. The protection of our water they figure shouldnt interfere with business. Not only will it soon be easier for pollution to seep into our waterways if a developer finds a wetland is in the way of a money making opportunity the habitat can be paved over altogether. Wetlands adjacent to a major body of water will warrant federal protection. The rest are fair game. Environmentalists are rightfully horrified and fearful of whats to come. Its not just clean drinking water the Trump White House has disregarded. Proposals have circulated to weaken regulations on planet warming emissions from power plants oil rigs and cars. Trump is trying to speed new drilling at the Arctic national wildlife refuge. As climate change accelerates and the planet hurdles ever closer to an existential crisis Trump went to a United Nations conference to tout the benefits katowice climate talks cop24.html of fossil fuels. The current administrator of the EPA Andrew Wheeler used to spend his time lobbying against environmental regulations on behalf of coal magnate Robert E Murray. He was chief counsel to Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma a proud denier of climate change. Democrats hoping Trump is impeached indicted or somehow toppled before 2020 should understand even such farfetched scenarios wont change the status quo. Trump has surrounded himself with people who care far more about the sanctity of fossil fuel profits than the safety of the American people. They worship at the altar of nihilistic capitalism. Mike Pence wont save you. For 2020 and beyond climate justice will have to become the most animating issue for Democrats not because its a winning argument though it is but because the future of the planet depends on it. This is why Alexandria Ocasio Cortez occupied ocasio cortez sunrise activists nancy pelosi Nancy Pelosis office to force support for a Green New Deal. We are left with no other alternatives. The job of the next president will be to undo the damage Trump has wrought. There will be much handwringing about the shattering of democratic norms but the real work will be in doing whatever we can in the little time we have to avert a true climate catastrophe.

Washington Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee invoked former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in announcing a legislation aimed at fighting global warming. There is no other option than victory because without victory there is not survival Inslee said at a press conference Monday. If that sounds apocalyptic then look at the science. Churchill gave similar remarks before British Parliament in May 1940 in the early days of World War II. Inslee and his allies cited the recent National Climate Assessment to back equating future global warming to Nazi Germany sweeping across Europe. Inslee who is a 2020 presidential contender is styling himself as a leader for Democrats agitating for action on global warming. Inslee is considering making global warming a central theme of his campaign should he seek the Democratic nomination in 2020. Inslees legislative pitch comes weeks after Washington voters rejected a ballot initiative to tax carbon dioxide emissions. The Inslee backed measure was defeated in an overwhelmingly Democratic state in November. Now Inslees back with an even more urgent message Adopt policies to tackle global warming or there is not survival. RELATED Congress Debates Whether More Tax Dollars Will Go Towards Add Ons For Luxury Electric Cars Inslees legislative proposal would force utilities to use 100 percent clean energy mandate more energy efficiency in buildings require a clean fuel standard and phase down hydrofluorocarbons HFCs in refrigerators and air conditioners. Those policies would cut Washington state greenhouse gases 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2035 according to Inslee. Washingtonians are ready to see their elected leaders step up to prevent further harm to our forests our air and our communities. These are enormous steps forward in our effort to save our state and our planet Inslee said. Washington already gets most of its electricity from clean energy being the largest state producer of hydroelectricity. The state also has existing laws mandating 15 percent of its electricity come from renewables like wind and solar. However Inslees critics point out that state green policies have raised energy prices including in Seattle where electricity prices have doubled since 2013. Costs have nearly doubled since 2013 Todd Myers environmental director at the Washington Policy Center tweeted Monday. Inslee also neglected to mention the most important aspect of climate policies their projected impact on future global warming. Thats probably because anything Washington state does will have no measurable impact on projected climate change. The governor also used alarming rhetoric when announcing carbon tax legislation earlier this year. We have just 59 days to do our part to save our children from an endless cycle of crop killing droughts one year and rivers spilling their banks the next Inslee tweeted in January.

The death toll in cyclone hit northern Mozambique has risen to 38 officials say as aid workers struggle to reach the worst affected areas. Cyclone Kenneth struck the southern African nation last week with winds of 220kmh 140mph flattening villages and damaging thousands more homes. The storm lost strength but torrential rain was still battering the area on Monday with more expected. As a result flights have been grounded hindering the aid effort. It is predicted the weather system will dump twice as much rainfall as Cyclone Idai which struck last month leaving more than 900 dead across Mozambique Malawi and Zimbabwe. The flood risk was compounded by Kenneth hitting at the end of the rainy season when river levels were already high the UN Office for the Co ordination of Humanitarian Affairs Ocha noted. Already Pemba the regional capital of Cabo Delgado state has experienced more than 2m 6.5ft of rain and flooding. According to Mozambique's National Institute of Disaster Management INGC 38 people have been killed by Cyclone Kenneth while another 35000 homes have been destroyed or damaged. The privately owned O Pais website reported five people died after part of a rubbish dump collapsed onto homes in Pemba on Sunday evening. It is unclear if these deaths are recorded in the government total. Ocha says humanitarian needs have sky rocketed and the humanitarian response will need to rapidly scale up. Some 200000 people are in danger in Pemba alone Ocha warned. Spokesman Saviano Abreu added that the situation in the northern towns of Macomia and Quissanga was critical while there were also worries for the cut off island of Ibo. But attempts to reach those areas had not been entirely successful. We managed to send one flight with World Food Programme WFP supplies of rice and biscuits and some non food items Mr Abreu told news agency AFP. But unfortunately the weather conditions are changing too fast and threatening the operation. It's raining again and the second flight couldn't go. This satellite image shows the cyclone over northern Mozambique and Tanzania on Friday night. On Sunday a spokesman for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was appealing for additional resources from the international community to fund the response in the immediate medium and longer term. Tropical cyclones in this part of the Indian Ocean are not that rare. However according to the BBC's Environment Correspondent Matt McGrath Cyclone Idai was the seventh such major storm of the Indian Ocean season when it struck back in March. That is more than double the average for the time of year. What's even more unusual however is the fact Idai and Kenneth hit in such quick succession. According to the World Meteorological Organization WMO there is no record of two storms of such intensity striking Mozambique in the same season. It is especially unusual in the context of the trend which has seen tropical cyclones in the region decrease slightly over the past seven decades. But it is far too early and too small a sample size to say whether this frequency is a direct result of climate change. Instead experts point to other elements making the storm's impact worse which they know are related to climate change. There is absolutely no doubt that when there is a tropical cyclone like this then because of climate change the rainfall intensities are higher Dr Friederike Otto from the University of Oxford told the BBC in the aftermath of Cyclone Idai. And also because of sea level rise the resulting flooding is more intense than it would be without human induced climate change. Cabo Delgado province is not as densely populated as the area hit by Cyclone Idai and there is apparently more high ground there. That in addition to warnings by authorities ahead of the storm could significantly stem losses compared with Cyclone Idai. But reports said many thousands of homes had been flattened by the winds and the area has been hit by militant Islamist violence in recent months which could complicate humanitarian operations. Thousands of people had already fled their homes to seek shelter from violence in camps for displaced people.	False	False	False	True	False
Conservation groups are protesting efforts to build a small offshore wind farm off the coast of Lake Erie arguing that the project poses a grave risk to the local bird population. A local energy company wants to construct a six turbine 20.7 megawatt offshore wind development eight miles from Cleveland in Lake Erie. If completed it would be the first freshwater offshore wind farm on the continent. Supporters point outthe project would create more than 500 jobs and pump millions into the local economy over the turbines 25 year lifespan. Lake Erie Energy Development Corporation the company behind the project also argues it would be a step forward for environmentally friendly energy production. However not every ecologically minded group is on board with Icebreaker the name of the project. The Black Swamp Bird Observatory and the American Bird Conservancy two different bird conservation groups are opposed to the proposal claiming the turbines would harm the local bird population and that major errors were made during an environmental assessment. RELATEDDisposal Of Wind Turbines Proving To Be A Major Environmental Concern We reject the environmental assessments claim that this wind energy facility would have little to no impact' on birds Kimberly Kaufman Black Swamp Bird Observatorys executive director said in a statement. The six turbine Icebreaker project poses a larger threat to wildlife than is now indicated in the documents Kaufman continued. But the planned expansion of offshore wind energy to over 1000 turbines will have even more major impacts to birds that breed and migrate across Lake Erie and that must be addressed. The bird conservancy groups point out that vast numbers of migratory birds and bats have been recorded just a few miles from the Great Lakes shorelines with many flying at the same level of the rotor swept area of windmills. They submitted their concerns to theU.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Energy. A second public hearing about Icebreaker will take place Thursday atCleveland City Council. This is far from the first time bird advocates have lamented over wind turbines. Wind farms across the globe kill thousands of birds a year that inadvertently fly into their turbines. Offshore wind farms while also posing a threat to birds can also harm the local aquatic ecosystem.

President Donald Trump blamed bad environmental laws for making wildfires spreading across California much worse in a Sunday tweet. Trump wrote these laws arent allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized which is instead being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire spreading! Persistent heat dry condition and winds have fueled several major wildfires across California the biggest of which is the Carr Fire thats scorched more than 140000 acres and killed seven people. RELATED NYT Claims Global Greening From CO2 Is Terrible Gets Owned State officials said the Carr Fire was sparked in late July by a flat tire on a trailer scraping against the asphalt on a road near Redding California. California Gov. Jerry Brown a Democrat blamed man made global warming for the states rash of intense fires in the last couple of years however wildfire experts and conservatives tend to blame poor land management policies coupled with the expansion of human development into fire prone areas. Thats likely what Trump is referring to when he tweeted must also tree clear to stop fire spreading! Thinning of trees and removing of dead vegetation and brush can help mitigate wildfires. Whats not a clear link to wildfires however is Trumps referral to California water supplies being diverted into the ocean. Hes likely referring to the diverting of water from the Sacramento San Joaquin River Delta into the ocean to protect the delta smelt an endangered fish. Republicans and farmers have complained about management of the smelt population for years because precious water was being pumped out to sea instead of going towards other uses including agriculture. Those concerns were magnified during the recent multi year drought and recent population surveys show fresh water diversion has not been enough to keep smelt populations from declining. However its unclear how diverting water into the Pacific Ocean affects wildfires in California. Trump also lambasted policies forcing river water to be diverted during the 2016 campaign. Is there a drought? Trump said at a rally in Fresno that year. No we have plenty of water adding we shove it out to sea. Trump approved disaster declarations for the Carr Fire making it easier for state and federal officials to share resources and coordinate a response.	True	True	False	False	False
Scientists have uncovered the largest volcanic region on Earth two kilometres below the surface of the vast ice sheet that covers west Antarctica. The project by Edinburgh University researchers has revealed almost 100 volcanoes with the highest as tall as the Eiger which stands at almost 4000 metres in Switzerland. Geologists say this huge region is likely to dwarf that of east Africas volcanic ridge currently rated the densest concentration of volcanoes in the world. And the activity of this range could have worrying consequences they have warned. If one of these volcanoes were to erupt it could further destabilise west Antarcticas ice sheets said glacier expert Robert Bingham one of the papers authors. Anything that causes the melting of ice which an eruption certainly would is likely to speed up the flow of ice into the sea. The big question is how active are these volcanoes? That is something we need to determine as quickly as possible. The Edinburgh volcano survey reported in the Geological Societys special publications series involved studying the underside of the west Antarctica ice sheet for hidden peaks of basalt rock similar to those produced by the regions other volcanoes. Their tips actually lie above the ice and have been spotted by polar explorers over the past century. But how many lie below the ice? This question was originally asked by the teams youngest member Max Van Wyk de Vries an undergraduate at the universitys school of geosciences and a self confessed volcano fanatic. He set up the project with the help of Bingham. Their study involved analysing measurements made by previous surveys which involved the use of ice penetrating radar carried either by planes or land vehicles to survey strips of the west Antarctic ice. The results were then compared with satellite and database records and geological information from other aerial surveys. Essentially we were looking for evidence of volcanic cones sticking up into the ice Bingham said. After the team had collated the results it reported a staggering 91 previously unknown volcanoes adding to the 47 others that had been discovered over the previous century of exploring the region. These newly discovered volcanoes range in height from 100 to 3850 metres. All are covered in ice which sometimes lies in layers that are more than 4km thick in the region. These active peaks are concentrated in a region known as the west Antarctic rift system which stretches 3500km from Antarcticas Ross ice shelf to the Antarctic peninsula. We were amazed Bingham said. We had not expected to find anything like that number. We have almost trebled the number of volcanoes known to exist in west Antarctica. We also suspect there are even more on the bed of the sea that lies under the Ross ice shelf so that I think it is very likely this region will turn out to be the densest region of volcanoes in the world greater even than east Africa where mounts Nyiragongo Kilimanjaro Longonot and all the other active volcanoes are concentrated. The discovery is particularly important because the activity of these volcanoes could have crucial implications for the rest of the planet. If one erupts it could further destabilise some of the regions ice sheets which have already been affected by global warming. Meltwater outflows into the Antarctic ocean could trigger sea level rises. We just dont know about how active these volcanoes have been in the past Bingham said. However he pointed to one alarming trend The most volcanism that is going in the world at present is in regions that have only recently lost their glacier covering after the end of the last ice age. These places include Iceland and Alaska. Theory suggests that this is occurring because without ice sheets on top of them there is a release of pressure on the regions volcanoes and they become more active. And this could happen in west Antarctica where significant warming in the region caused by climate change has begun to affect its ice sheets. If they are reduced significantly this could release pressure on the volcanoes that lie below and lead to eruptions that could further destabilise the ice sheets and enhance sea level rises that are already affecting our oceans. It is something we will have to watch closely Bingham said.	True	False	False	True	True
Bill Nye took on Republican Rep. Thomas Massey who claims to be an electrical engineer but he doesnt understand climate change. And the guy that I saw the other day if I may take a moment was congressman Thomas Massey from Kentucky and he is an electrical engineer. He says on his website he claims to be an inventor and he acted as though he cannot grasp this he focused on the idea that 800000 years ago there was a higher level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than there is today and how do we know that? By looking at the ice cores or the ancient atmospheres in the ancient ice. I presume you dont watch MSNBCA member of his staff might. Thats what Im hoping for. Im hoping for. So congressman or the congressmans staff heres the hockey stick graph that you guys love to go off thats been debunked. No it hasnt been debunked. Its a fact. If youre really an electrical engineer heres the problem. The rate of global warming if it was even detectable at this scale with about .1 degrees celsius every thousand or maybe even every 10000 years. Now its that .1 degree Celsius every decade. So congressman its like this in calculus terms. The rate of temperature getting bigger is very high. This would be dT dt where capital T is temperature and and the lower case is time or congressmans staff if out there thats the problem. This looks like an exaggerated hockey stick because it is. Its the speed. The Trump administration recently called a science a Democrat thing so no one should expect the Republican Party to get won over into believing facts again but Bill Nye laid it all out nice and easy. The temperature is rising quickly. It is a race against time and the longer that Republicans deny and delay the worse it will be for our planet our people and our future.

ROME Reuters Pope Francis implicitly criticized the United States on Monday for pulling out of the Paris agreement on climate change praising it as a means to control the devastating effects of global warming. The United States is the only country out of 195 signatories to have withdrawn from the accord which aims to cut emissions blamed for the rise in temperatures. U.S. President Donald Trump announced the decision in June shortly after visiting the pope a strong supporter of the deal. At the time a Vatican official said the move was a slap in the face for the pope and the Vatican. We see consequences of climate change every day the pope said in an address to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation FAO at its headquarters in Rome. Thanks to scientific knowledge we know how we have to confront the problem and the international community has also worked out the legal methods such as the Paris Accord which sadly some have abandoned he said. Under the deal United States had committed to reducing its own emissions by 26 to 28 percent compared with 2005 levels by 2025. Many world leaders have criticized Trump for deciding to pull out. In his Spanish language address to the U.N. agency Francis denounced negligence toward the delicate equilibriums of the ecosystems the presumption of manipulating and controlling the limited resources of the planet and the greed for profit. Agriculture ministers and diplomats from the Group of Seven G7 world power nations attended the gathering which marked FAOs World Food Day. We cant be satisfied by saying someone else will do it' the pope said. Ending local conflicts and curbing the effects of climate change were two of the prerequisites for dealing with world food security Francis also said. The yoke of poverty caused by the often tragic movement of migrants can be removed by prevention consisting of development projects that create jobs and offer the capacity to respond to climactic and environmental changes he said.

Two of the attorneys representing various cities in climate litigation against oil companies have a history of suing and counter suing each other over personal squabbles according to documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. Environmental attorneys Vic Sher and Matt Pawa got intoa multi million dollar legal dispute in 2014 stemming from a lawsuit they both worked on against ExxonMobil. Sher who was with Sher Leff at the time allegedPawas group Pawa Law Group failed to distribute money from a settlement in the case. Pawa in turn argued in a lawsuit that Sher was the one cheating him out of millions of dollars. Sher who is now with Sher Edling eventually paid Pawa about 6 million for the retributionscourt documents show. The disagreementstems from a lawsuit New Hampshire filed in 2013 alleging Exxon negligently contaminated the states water ways with 2 billion gallons of MTBE a gas additive experts believe poisons drinking water. The intrigue comes amid growing bad blood between the two sides. The state initially sued 26 oil companies in 2003 over the contamination. New Hampshire previously collected over 130 million for MTBE cleanup from the other defendants. The jury eventually awarded the state damages of 816 million. Exxon was made to pay roughly 29 percent of market share which equaled roughly 236372664 at the time of the lawsuit. New Hampshires Supreme Courtupheld the decisionin 2015 after Exxon appealed the ruling to the top court. A dispute arose between Pawa and Sher in 2012 relating to the division of attorneys fees between them under a contract with New Hampshire which retained both to represent the state in the Exxon contamination case. A panel eventually awarded Pawa nearly 6 million for breaching the agreement. Sher Leff refused to comply with the final award including payment of the amounts awarded to Pawas law firm even while Sher Leff pocketed more than 27 million in attorneys fees from the Exxon case. Sher countersued in 2014 arguing Pawa entered into a secondary oral agreement that the legal fees associated with the case would be delivered proportionally. Shers case was dismissed. Neither Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP a California based law firm that now employs Pawa nor Sher Edling responded to TheDCNFs request for comment about how the nearly five year old lawsuit is affecting their current legal pursuits of Exxon. Both law firms Sher Edling and Hagens Berman are barnstorming the country convincing cities to sue energy companies for allegedly contributing to damage caused by climate change. The rivalry between the two attorneys heated up Nov. 26 after San Francisco and Oaklandfired Hagens Bermanand hired Sher Edling to represent the cities as they appeal a courts decision to dismiss their lawsuits against Exxon.

A new study published in the highly influential journal Nature suggests rising global temperatures during the 19th and 20th centuries may be linked to greater plant photosynthesis. The study conducted by researchers at the University of California at Merced estimated based on its models the sum of all plant photosynthesis on Earth grew by 30 percent over the 200 year record captured according to an article published on the UC Merced website. Photosynthesis is the process of converting carbon dioxide into carbohydrates which power plants using sunlight. According to the UC Merced article The research did not identify the cause of the increased photosynthesis but computer models have shown several processes that could together create such a large change in global plant growth. The leading candidates are rising atmospheric CO2 levels a result of emissions from human activities longer growing seasons a result of climate change caused by CO2 emissions and nitrogen pollution another result of fossil fuel combustion and agriculture the article also claims. In other words more carbon dioxide which is being produced by humans at record levels has improved plant growth which in turn improves food production for humans and animals. Campbell said the evidence shows a fundamental shift in the Earths plants and that global plant growth should be a central goal for the human race. However dont too excited Campbell warns. He says despite the researchers findings which clearly show global warming helps plantsand thus also helping humans and animalsglobal warming has many negative effects too such as causing climate change which will increase flooding of coastal cities extreme weather and ocean acidification. The researchers study in Nature provided no proof oftheclaim global warming is caused by humans or that global warming will cause the severe problemsCampbell said it will in the quotes provided by the UC Merced article. The study also offered no solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions without causing severe economic and social problems for billions of people. The study did however show increased carbon dioxide levels have generally helped plants and crops.	False	False	False	True	True
A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit Friday targeting ExxonMobil on the basis that two California cities waging a legal battle could not prove the energy company was responsible for climate change in the state. District Judge William Alsup wrote that San Francisco and Oakland failed to prove that global warming would be substantially curtailed if the oil company did not operate inside California. His decision follows a ruling the judge made in June dismissing both cases on the grounds that Congress not the court system is responsible for addressing the emission of greenhouse gasses. It is manifest thatglobal warming would have continued in the absence of all California related activities of defendants Alsup wrote in his July 27 decision. Plaintiffs have therefore failed to adequately link each defendants alleged California activities to plaintiffs harm. Cities in Colorado Rhode Island and New York have also filed similar lawsuits against energy producers over the past year. They argue that Exxon and others should pony up money for mitigation efforts designed to forestall the effects from climate change. Many of the lawsuits have already been nixed. Alsup also suggested that climate change would be no better or worse even if Exxon were not operating in California.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders dismissed a major White House climate change report that some have used to criticize President Donald Trumps position on global warming. The report is not based on facts Sanders told reporters during a press conference Tuesday. She also arguedthat climate modeling of the kind researchers used in the National Climate Assessment report is never exact. We think that this is the most extreme version and its not based on facts she said. Its not data driven. Wed like to see something that is more data driven. Its based on modeling which is extremely hard to do when youre talking about the climate. The NCA report came from a team of 13 federal agencies and was cobbled together with the help of 300 scientists. They used a Representative Concentration Pathway adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes IPCC fifth Assessment Report AR5 to make their conclusions. Continued use of coal and other fossil fuels will eliminate 10 percent of the GDP by 2100according to the report. The country will also be 3 to 12 degrees hotter depending on the level of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere the report warns. It also suggests wildfires and hurricanes will increase as a result if the risk is left unchecked. The report is not without its controversies. One climate expert argues researchers used an unreliable climate model. University of Colorado Prof. Roger Pielke Jr. for instance criticized the researchers in a series of tweets Saturday for basing their modeling on a data that are likely to change dramatically over the course of the next 80 years. He says the NCAs second volume relies on the RCP8.5 one of the four possible pathways in the trajectory. RELATED A Top Line Claim In The Newest US Climate Report Relies On Research Tied To Major Democratic Donors This particular pathway is slowly being phased out of the IPCCs modeling becausescientists believethe model likely overestimates future supply of fossil fuels. Researchers used the most extreme example possible to sell the narrative that wildfires will get worse Pielke noted. He has criticized the medias handling of similar reports. NCAs dire prediction of a 10 percent hit to U.S. GDP comes froma 2017 study supported by the charitable foundations founded by major Democratic donors. The study was also funded by other organizations including theNational Science Foundation the U.S. Department of Energy and the Skoll Global Threats Fund.

His environmental policy record in his home state is long. In 2015 he ordered Washingtons Department of Ecology to impose a cap on carbon emissions. He created a fund for clean energy and the state now has extensive solar energy infrastructure and electric buses. While economic damage is a concern for opponents of limiting fossil fuels Washington had the highest G.D.P. growth in the nation in 2018 according to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. Mr. Inslee also tried unsuccessfully last year to get the Washington Legislature to vote on a carbon tax which would have been the first in the nation voters rejected the proposal in November. He then proposed a different series of actions including running the states electric utilities fully on renewable power by 2045 requiring buildings to be more energy efficient promoting electric vehicles and cutting down on hydrofluorocarbons which are used in air conditioners. Hydrofluorocarbon emissions have been growing faster than any other form of greenhouse gas emissions. In an op ed in The Washington Post Mr. Inslee called for net zero carbon emissions nationwide by 2050 a longer timeline than the Green New Deals 10 years which experts say is unrealistic. Net zero could mean either eliminating carbon emissions altogether or reducing them and using offsetting technologies to cancel out the rest. He also called for a 100 percent clean energy grid and massive investments to transition buildings industries and transportation to renewable sources. While Mr. Inslee has made clear that he intends to focus overwhelmingly on climate change he is on the record supporting liberal policies in many other areas. He has been outspoken in favor of gun control and after the shooting in Parkland Fla. last year he confronted President Trump on live television denouncing Mr. Trumps suggestion to arm schoolteachers. Among other measures he wants to expand background checks and restrict some semiautomatic weapons. His advocacy on the issue goes back many years he lost his seat in Congress after voting for the 1994 assault weapons ban.	True	False	False	True	True
The last time Californian climate scientist Peter Kalmus was on an airplane was in 2012 He says it made him feel physically sick and like he was stealing from his children's future and vowed never to fly again. US President Donald Trump's administration has made no secret of its disdain for climate science but that hasn't stopped some ordinary Americans from finding ways to drastically reduce their own carbon footprints hoping to persuade others through their examples. Kalmus was pursuing his post doctoral studies in 2009 when he became increasingly concerned about the prospect of climate breakdown tipping points such as the thawing of the Earth's permafrost triggering runaway global warming that wreaks havoc on weather systems. I was shaking people by the lapels posting screeds on Facebook not really getting anywhere he told AFP in an interview from his home in a Los Angeles suburb. Eventually it dawned on me that I should maybe bring my actions into alignment with my beliefs. Drawing upon his expertise as a scientist he calculated the emissions associated with various aspects of his life and was surprised to learn that electricity consumption made up a tiny portion compared to air travel. So I started focusing on flying less. I tried being a vegetarian for a month and I liked it better he said quickly realizing that rather than feeling like sacrifices the changes he made were improving his sense of wellbeing. Some people like Tarek Maassarani take their philosophy to what others may see as extremes. The bespectacled 40 year old with long blond hair does paid consulting for the United States Institute of Peace and is an adjunct professor at two Washington universities but performs the bulk of his work in the volunteer sector. Two years ago he moved out of a co housing community in a Washington suburb when his two sons shifted to Utah to live with their mother and has been living between friends' houses ever since. Apart from relying almost exclusively on his bicycle for transport including deep into winter Maassarani is focused on avoiding buying new products because of the energy intensive nature of their production. He instead depends on hand me downs and I sort of extend the life of things well past what most people would do finding ways to keep tatty decade old cell phones and laptops going. He gets much of his food from dumpster diving or from the leftovers at buffets from conferences he attends describing himself as a supply and demand vegan. What this means is I don't buy any animal products I try not to create any demand signal for animal products he said. At the same time if meat is all that is left when he rummages through garbage or approaches buffets he makes it a point to go last he will consume it. Maassarani is quick to admit that his case falls well outside what most people could envisage and is made possible only by living in what he calls a consumption excessive society. I'm aware of course that if the excesses weren't there it wouldn't work but then again the problem wouldn't be there. Others like Elizabeth Hogan lead more conventional lives but are still re orienting themselves toward more carbon neutrality. Hogan who works as a consultant on mitigating the impact of ocean plastics on marine life just outfitted solar panels on the roof of her home in Washington. She and her husband estimate these will account for 80 percent of their energy needs with the balance coming from wind power bought at a premium from their electric provider. Both of our careers are very planet oriented so it's kind of our whole lives but I am certainly not claiming to be perfect she says conceding that they both fly extensively for work. Her love of cheese means she's a vegetarian rather than a vegan but sources her dairy from a nearby local farm that cleans and re uses glass bottles returned to them. But how impactful can individual action be in the absence of systemic changes from the top? After all the United States' current climate commitments are rated by Climate Action Tracker as critically insufficient in meeting the goal of limiting long term warming to two degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels. Kalmus who has written a book on his experiences said meeting critical goals to avert disaster will require a rapid cultural transformation and acts of individual defiance help achieve that. The reason everyone's waking up is because there's been this massive grassroots shift over the last year or two he said citing the global youth movement for climate action. One of the many ways people can contribute to that movement is by telling others about steps they have personally taken then when you say 'this is really urgent' your words are backed by the truth of your actions.

US crude oil and petrochemical refining capacity in Texas has been severely damaged by Hurricane Harvey releasing hazardous pollutants into the air and flood waters left in the wake of the storm. Arkema a global chemical major warned Wednesday that flooding has severely damaged their Houston plant's refrigeration systems increasing the likelihood of an explosion in the coming week and a heightened risk of yet more pollutants leaking into the ecosystem. At this time while we do not believe there is any imminent danger the potential for a chemical reaction leading to a fire andor explosion within the site confines is real Arkema said in a statement. Oil giant Exxon Mobil is among the companies to report incidents of emissions released at its refineries as a result of the hurricane which ransacked coastal parts of Texas and caused widespread flooding in the countrys fourth biggest city Houston. However the true extent of the air pollution will prove hard to determine for some time after the storm subsides as The Texas Council on Environmental Quality shut down all of its air quality monitors in the Houston area according to the Houston Press. This effectively means the affected companies can report whatever they wish without any oversight from the state regulators. Texas is also home to several so called superfund sites designated areas of extreme pollution which warrant further investigation according to the Environmental Protection Agency. As shown in the before and after maps below the vast majority of these toxic sites are now flooded in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. On Wednesday Saudi owned Motiva shuttered its refinery in Port Arthur Texas the largest facility in the US which normally produces 600000 barrels a day. At least 13 other refineries in the area closed as a result of Harvey the US Department of Energy reported while others are operating at limited capacity. Exxon admitted there were issues at its plants in a regulatory filing to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Its Baytown refinery near Houston the second largest in the country was shutdown on Sunday as Harvey moved inland. The refinery reported two controlled emission release events which included carbon monoxide nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide and benzene being released into the atmosphere. The chemicals and pollutants released from refineries and plants in Texas petrochemical hub are known to have a damaging effect on the environment and could pose a risk of contaminating floodwaters left in the hurricanes wake. The petrochemical Benzene a carcinogen and major component in fossil fuels reduces red and white blood cell production and decreases auto immune cell function following prolonged exposure. While other emissions including sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are particle forming air pollutants that contribute to cardiopulmonary health issues like lung cancer bronchitis and emphysema. In a third reported incident since Harvey made landfall in Texas Exxon said a floating roof over a tank in its Baytown refinery sank as a result of the rain causing unusually high levels of emissions to be released. Floating roofs are common in oil tanks and are a way to control how much oil is lost to evaporation by allowing the roof to move based on the amount of liquid in the tank. Exxon said it would conduct an assessment to determine the impact of the storm once its safe to do so the Washington Post reports. The company said it needed to make repairs on the tank which would involve first emptying it though Exxon could not confirm in what time frame. One of the companys other facilities in Beaumont east of Houston also released 1300lbs of sulphur dioxide in one hour on Sunday exceeding its allocated emissions limit by a factor of ten to one. Excess emissions occurred during an upset on the Sulfur Plant Thermal Oxidizer Exxon said in the report. The unit was stabilized. No impact to the community has been reported the company said. Actions were taken to minimize emissions and to restore the refinery to normal operations. Petrochemical giant Chevron Phillips reported an estimated 776000 pounds of combined chemicals released from its Cedar Bayou plant in Baytown as part of its plant shutdown. Kinder Morgan the largest energy infrastructure company in North America stores petroleum products for companies such as Chevron and Shell at its terminal in Pasadena Harris. It reported 394000 pounds of combined hazardous chemicals on Sunday and Monday also as a result of a malfunctioning floating roof. In this case it caused product to spill to the ground. Kinder Morgan said it will attempt to safely land roof of Tank 150 39 and remove product when conditions are safe. It added it was taking all necessary steps to prevent or minimize any increased risk to human health and safety and to the environment. Almost one third of US oil refining capacity is located on the Gulf Coast. The US produces about 17.5 million barrels of oil per day. According to oil market analysts cited by CNBC about 20 percent of the countrys oil refining operations are out of service. Ships carrying crude oil from the Mexican Gulf are not able to port in the area due to swelling waters caused by Harvey resulting in a backlog of ships waiting to dock and unload their cargo. The Gulf of Mexico accounts for close to 20 percent of total US crude oil production. CNBC estimates the port closures cost roughly 350 million a day. The port hold up also affects the amount of crude oil refineries have access to once they return to full operation. Gas prices across the US have already risen to a two year high with the increase likely to hit consumers at the pump in a week. It is unknown how long the refineries will remain out of production as the extent of flood damage is not yet known. Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 refineries in the area didnt return to normal production capacity for two months.	False	False	False	True	False
Lawsuits are a poor way to make the tradeoff between abundant energy and environmental harm. Numerous jurisdictions are suing energy companies. Not for fraud or white collar crime but for the effects of climate change. Bill de Blasio mayor of New York recently added his city to the list and also started to divest the citys pension funds from fossil fuel companies. But the phenomenon is primarily a California centric one. In an address at SXSW earlier this month even Arnold Schwarzenegger joined the fray. Presumably this will soon be a cause clbre. But it is unlikely to succeed and lawsuits are a poor way to address the environmental harms of energy production anyhow. As David Bookbinder at the Niskanen Center notes while all of the complaints are grounded in the energy companies alleged accountability for rising sea levels they fall into two essential categories. San Francisco and Oakland allege public nuisance and are suing to win compensation for that nuisance. This is the usual category for environmental harm suits the same legal theory by which localities have sued over lead pollution water pollution and the like. It was also the basis for the successful legal action taken against lead paint producers in the same area. According to Bookbinder the claim simply requires demonstrating that the defendant contributed to a condition that constitutes an unreasonable interference with public rights. The other plaintiffs namely San Mateo County Marin County and Imperial Beach are employing a much more scattershot strategy not only in the number of defendants that they name nearly 40 but in alleging design defect failure to warn negligence and trespass in addition to public nuisance. This approach gives juries multiple routes to a ruling against the energy companies but it could backfire with so many claims being made against such a wide variety of defendants that none of the blows really land. So whats the problem? The Union of Concerned Scientists the activist group that has spearheaded this push for legal action has compared energy companies behavior with that of tobacco companies decades ago. The comparison reveals two fundamental issues with the suits. First unlike smoking energy is a basic good. Some form of energy is necessary to do just about anything including to meet essential needs such as heating or cooling a home which in some places is a genuine safety issue. There is an inherent tradeoff between affordable energy and environmental harm and it makes no sense to ask judges and juries rather than elected legislators to strike the right balance. Second a key allegation against cigarette companies was that they hid and denied the harms of smoking but the parallel allegations against the energy companies are contradictory. We are expected to believe that energy companies covered up the damage done by fossil fuels and yet publicly available industry funded research is cited as evidence that the companies were aware of the harms they were causing. For instance San Mateo Countys lawsuit notes that Exxon made its climate findings public in peer reviewed science journals by 1982. Another obstacle is the fact that energy companies have government granted permits to do what they do a fact that some courts have found highly relevant. In North Carolina v. Tennessee Valley Authority the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit dismissed a common law nuisance action on the grounds that there is a distinction between an activity that is merely not illegal versus one that is explicitly granted a permit to operate in a particular fashion. The opinion further notes citing New England Legal Foundation v. Costle that courts traditionally have been reluctant to enjoin as a public nuisance activities which have been considered and specifically authorized by the government. Local lawsuits also struggle to address the global scope of the climate change problem. According to a study that is often drawn upon to make the case for liability the two largest contributors to the rise in CO2 emissions since 1980 are Saudi Aramco and Gazprom the state owned oil companies of Saudi Arabia and Russia. The initial San Mateo suit did name Statoil a company majority owned by the Norwegian government as a defendant but even this was dropped in an effort to keep the case in state as opposed to federal court. As the eminent legal scholar Richard Epstein puts it If youre going to need a system of regulation you can do that in a thousand different ways but erratic independent lawsuits in separate courts by separate people is the wrong way to go. This approach is likely to cause backlash that derails real sustainable reforms to protect the environment.	True	True	True	True	True
Donald Trump is threatening to derail climate change efforts with his persistent denial of global warming claim scientists. Pulling the US from the Paris Agreement has opened the flood gates as several others including Russia and Turkey follow his lead. Trump removed the US the second greatest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world from the Paris Agreement as one of his first major presidential acts. One expert has published a study and said that the withdrawal of the US from the 2015 Paris Agreement as well as Trump's ill informed remarks on climate change could have long lasting and severe ramifications. AUnited Nations sponsored climate summit in Poland has kicked off today which brings together experts from around the world as leading figures in the UN claim our planet has reached a 'crossroads'. They say the next two years are crucial to our success if we are to successfully halt global warming. A study fromthe Institute of International and European Affairs says Trump's decision has created the 'moral and political cover for others to follow suit' in leaving the agreement. It also claims it has soured the atmosphere and damaged goodwill in the international arena. 'The Paris agreement sent a shiver down the spine of institutional investors globally and made them question if they were exposed to stranded assets and whether these political leaders were really serious about climate change' saidJoseph Curtin a senior fellow at the IIEA. 'There's absolutely no doubt that the Trump effect has created a sense of uncertainty in terms of the political commitment to achieve anything close to a 2C target.' The Paris Agreement which was first signed in 2015 is an international agreement to control and limit climate change. It hopes to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2C 3.6F 'and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C 2.7F' Sir David Attenborough will be in attendance in the 'people's seat' to represent the people who are affected by global warming. He gave a speech at the opening ceremony of the summit and said We are facing a man made disaster of global scale. 'Our greatest threat in thousands of years. Climate Change.' The Conference of the Parties COP comes shortly after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC announced the intention to limitglobal temperature rise to 1.5C. This gathering has been pegged as the most influential since the 2015 ratification of the Paris Agreement. It claimed that to achieve this goal governments around the worldwould have to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent by 2030. Four influential previous presidents of the talks called for decisive action to reach these targets. They said the planet sits at a 'crossroads' and urged action to cut emissions and reach Paris targets. Antonio Guterres UN Secretary General said this period of time is'a matter of life and death' for countries around the world. A statement from the former chiefs came a day before the summit was scheduled to begin and is a highly unusual move. It earmarked the next two years as a key opportunity to help halt climate change. It read 'What ministers and other leaders say and do in Katowice at COP24 will help determine efforts for years to come and either bring the world closer to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement including protecting those most vulnerable to climate change or push action further down the road. 'Any delay will only make it harder and more expensive to respond to climate change.' The statement was issued by Frank Bainimarama of Fiji Salaheddine Mezouar of Morocco Laurent Fabius of France and Manuel Pulgar Vidal of Peru. In a report released ahead of the climate summit in Poland the World Meteorological Organisation WMO pointed out that the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years. It found that 2018 is on course to be the 4th warmest year on record and we're the 'last generation to be able to do something about it'. The UN agency said in its provisional report that 'the past four years 2015 2016 2017 and 2018 are also the four warmest years in the series'.	True	False	False	True	True
Washington CNN Since the Trump administration released its blockbuster report on the day after Thanksgiving outlining the dire environmental and economic impacts of climate change it has made a series of policy and diplomatic decisions or statements that appear to run counter to all of the warnings in the report. In fact none are designed to reduce fossil fuel emissions which the report said is needed to combat extreme climate change which otherwise will cause substantial damages to the US economy environment and human health and well being over the coming decades. President Donald Trump who previously has called climate change a hoax has rejected the report's conclusion that climate change could be devastating for the economy saying I don't believe it. Here's what the administration has said and done since Thanksgiving EPA acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the carbon capture technology required by the Obama era made constructing new power plants too expensive. But the decline of coal for power plants has been a long term trend regardless as the energy industry has moved to less expensive sources such as natural gas. Environmentalists worry the proposed rule suggests the EPA will set new standards that would weaken the requirements that the agency uses to regulate other types of pollution. The administration may be trying to lower the bar significantly for future new sources of pollution that the EPA tries to regulate said Mary Anne Hitt senior director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign. Sides with Russia Saudi Arabia and Kuwait at climate conference Considering Trump announced the US would walk away from the Paris climate agreement which brought together the rest of the world it's no surprise the US continues to be an outlier on the international stage. Countries were asked to welcome the report put out by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which says governments around the world must take rapid far reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society to avoid disastrous levels of global warming. The US and the three other nations sided against welcoming the measure. The United States was willing to note the report and express appreciation to the scientists who developed it but not to welcome it as that would denote endorsement of the report the State Department said in a statement. As we have made clear in the IPCC and other bodies the United States has not endorsed the findings of the report it added. At the recent G20 meeting in Argentina which came just days after the release of that dire climate report US diplomats insisted on noting that the US reaffirmed its intention to withdraw from the Paris accord. A clause in a communique signed by the member nations says the US reiterates its decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and affirms its strong commitment to economic growth and energy access and security utilizing all energy sources and technologies while protecting the environment. When the US Geological Survey last week announced a major discovery of oil and natural gas underneath Texas and New Mexico Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke called it a gift. Christmas came a few weeks early this year he said. American strength flows from American energy and as it turns out we have a lot of American energy. Zinke's position involves the dual and sometimes competing roles of overseeing leases to develop resources such as oil natural gas and minerals and preserving federal lands for wildlife and human recreational uses. The Interior Department proposed to cut protections that benefited the sage grouse a grassland bird that lives in the Great Plains and western states which could allow for expanded oil and drilling. The plan would remove protections on nearly 9 million acres of protected habitat. The oil industry says any impacts minimal because of improved technology and more limited footprint needed for exploration.	True	False	False	True	False
The Trump administration has escalated its fight with California over environmental regulations. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler sent a letter Monday to the California Air Resources Board threatening to withdraw billions of dollars in federal highway money unless the state clears a backlog of air pollution control plans. California has the worst air quality in the United States with 82 nonattainment areas and 34 million people living in areas that do not meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards Wheeler wrote. California's population topography weather and other factors do worsen air pollution there but the state also is widely recognized as a leader in improving air quality. Under the Clean Air Act states that don't meet federal air quality standards are required to submit State Implementation Plans. Wheeler says California represents a disproportionate share of the backlog of such plans. Since the 1970s California has failed to carry out its most basic tasks under the Clean Air Act said Wheeler. He then laid out the penalties for failing to meet federal requirements which include losing federal highway dollars. California is expected to receive about 8 billion in fiscal years 2019 and 2020. The Trump administration has been picking fights with California over environmental regulations recently. Last week the administration said it will revoke a waiver that allows California to set stricter car emission standards. A senior EPA official said the two actions were not linked and that California is the focus now because it represents the largest share of backlogged plans. Even though other states have similar backlogs the administration has not sent letters to them. Gov. Gavin Newsom has been critical of President Trump's environmental record and challenged the administration in court. Newsom called Wheeler's letter a brazen political stunt. The White House has no interest in helping California comply with the Clean Air Act to improve the health and well being of Californians. This letter is a threat of pure retaliation Newsom says. Former EPA officials say they were surprised Wheeler sent the letter to California. I just think it's so ironic that the EPA is chastising California which has been so progressive in working towards cleaner air more than any other place in the country says Janet McCabe who was an EPA official during the Obama administration and now directs Indiana University's Environmental Resilience Institute. McCabe says it's unusual for the EPA to publicly criticize a state in this way. She says typically the agency would communicate with a state privately and work out differences to encourage a cooperative rather than adversarial relationship.	False	True	False	True	False
Much of Venice was left under water this week after the highest tide in 50 years ripped through the historic Italian city AFP PhotoFilippo MONTEFORTE Venice AFP Italy on Thursday declared a state of emergency for Venice after an exceptional tide surged through churches shops and homes causing millions of euros worth of damage to the UNESCO city. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the cabinet had approved the state of emergency and ordered the immediate release of 20 million euros 22 million in funds for the most urgent interventions in the devastated city after Tuesday's flooding. Despite the emergency tourists larked around in the flooded St Mark's Square in the sunshine snapping selfies in their neon plastic boots and taking advantage of a respite in bad weather which has driven the high tides. Sirens warning of fresh flooding rang through the canal city early Thursday but the water level remained low compared to Tuesday's tide the highest in 50 years. Conte who has called the flooding a blow to the heart of our country met Venice's mayor and emergency services before jumping in a speed boat to visit businesses and locals affected by the tide. Residents whose houses had been hit would immediately get up to 5000 euros in government aid while restaurant and shop owners could receive up to 20000 euros and apply for more later he said. Several museums remained closed to the public on Thursday. As authorities assessed the extent of the damage to Venice's cultural treasures such as St Mark's Basilica where water invaded the crypt locals were defiant. Many stopped for their habitual coffees at flooded bars drinking their espresso while standing in several inches of water. Austrian tourist Cornelia Litschauer 28 said she felt mixed emotions seeing Venice's famous square half submerged. For the tourists it's amazing it's something to see. But for the people who live here it's a real problem Litschauer said cradling her white Chihuahua Pablo. It's strange. Tourists are taking pictures but the city is suffering. The Locanda Al Leon hotel said its bookings had suffered from the international media coverage of the flood with some guests cancelling their rooms after seeing images of Venice underwater. Under the arches of the Ducal Palace a couple from Hong Kong posed for photos in the chilly morning sun. This trip was planned a long time ago so we couldn't change it groom Jay Wong 34 said. Actually this is a good experience. It's an adventure. Tuesday's acqua alta or high waters submerged around 80 percent of the city officials said. Only once since records began in 1923 has the water crept even higher reaching 1.94 metres in 1966. Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi arrived for a private tour of the damage sustained to the basilica while rival leader of the Italian right Matteo Salvini was due to drop by for the same on Friday. French tourist Manon Gaudre 22 said seeing Venice submerged was a unique experience. The damage it's causing to monuments and the people is worrying she said wondering if climate change was to blame. Many including Venice's mayor have blamed the disaster on global warming and warned that Italy a country prone to natural disasters must wake up to the risks posed by ever more volatile seasons. We need to be resilient and adapt. We need a policy that looks at the climate through completely different eyes Environment Minister Sergio Costa said Thursday. Mayor Luigi Brugnaro has estimated the damage to Venice at hundreds of millions of euros. The Serenissima as the floating city is called is home to a mere 50000 residents but receives 36 million global visitors each year. A massive infrastructure project called MOSE has been under way since 2003 to protect the city but it has been plagued by cost overruns corruption scandals and delays. This engineering solution that will end up costing nearly six billion euros has got to work Transport Minister Paola De Micheli said. The plan involves 78 gates that can be raised to protect Venice's lagoon during high tides but a recent attempt to test part of it caused worrying vibrations and engineers discovered it had rusted.

Environmental groups were not going to be happy with anyone President Donald Trump picked for the Supreme Court. But the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has them especially worried. A conservative who would replace the more moderate Justice Anthony Kennedy Kavanaugh has a record of slapping back Environmental Protection Agency regulations during his 12 years as a federal appeals court judge. Kavanaugh could shift the court to the right in many areas. But Kennedy was especially pivotal on environmental cases ruling with the majority on nearly all of them over 30 years on the bench and often siding with the environmentalists in the biggest cases. Kavanaugh has a narrower view of what environmental protections the federal government can implement. That was clear from an Associated Press review of his opinions while on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit along with other writings and speeches. It threatens to take us back to the old days said Pat Gallagher the legal director at the Sierra Club recalling environmental disasters from the 1960s and '70s. The Cuyahoga River Love Canal when there was no environmental protection. Kavanaugh's backers don't see him as anti environment. His rulings in cases involving the EPA say far more about the aggressive nature of the EPA in terms of trying to stretch beyond its breaking point its mandate from Congress said John Malcolm vice president of the conservative Heritage Foundation's Institute for Constitutional Government. Republicans hope the Senate can confirm Kavanaugh by the time the court's next session begins Oct. 1. But that is in doubt because of delays in reviewing documents related to Kavanaugh's time in President George W. Bush's administration. In his opinions on environmental issues Kavanaugh has often stressed the importance of policies to protect against climate change before saying that Congress not the EPA should create those policies. One prominent example came last year in a majority opinion that found the EPA lacks the authority to regulate hydrofluorocarbons chemicals linked to global warming. Kavanaugh wrote EPA's well intentioned policy objectives with respect to climate change do not on their own authorize the agency to regulate. William Buzbee a Georgetown Law professor who teaches constitutional and environmental law said Kavanaugh often rules that either Congress didn't delegate duties clearly enough to the EPA or that the agency wasn't carrying them out correctly in contrast with a history of judges giving wide latitude to agencies to try to solve problems. It's a move that sounds like an attitude of deference and separation of power Buzbee said. The effect is to take away an agency's powers to deal with real world problems. President Barack Obama relied heavily on administrative action as Republicans controlled Congress for most of his presidency and resisted passing laws that favored environmental protections over companies. Kavanaugh addressed that in the hydrofluorocarbons case Under the Constitution congressional inaction does not license an agency to take matters into its own hands even to solve a pressing policy issue such as climate change. Kavanaugh took similar approaches in two major 2012 rulings. In one Kavanaugh dissented from the circuit wanting to grant further review in a case in which the appeals court upheld the EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gases. In another Kavanaugh wrote the majority opinion to eliminate a 2011 EPA rule limiting emissions from power plants and other sources to reduce pollution in neighboring states. Writing for a divided panel he found that this good neighbor rule overstepped the EPA's authority. The Supreme Court overruled Kavanaugh. In a speech last year at the American Enterprise Institute Kavanaugh praised the late Justice Antonin Scalia for applying a principle laid out by Chief Justice William Rehnquist to an EPA case. The major questions doctrine he said is critical to limiting the ability of agencies to make major policy decisions that belong to Congress at least unless Congress clearly delegates that authority. Still Kavanaugh has not always ruled against environmental regulation. In 2010 he wrote the majority opinion for a divided panel when trucking groups sued the EPA over California's regulations for engines such as those that power refrigeration systems on trucks. Kavanaugh praised the agency for properly following Congress' directions in delegating that narrow area of regulation to California. In environmental cases judges often must sort out who has the legal standing to challenge regulations or push for protections. The Supreme Court now for decades has said that environmental and aesthetic interests count for standing Buzbee said. My sense is they count less for Judge Kavanaugh. In a 2014 case he wrote the unanimous opinion finding that environmental groups did not have standing to challenge an EPA decision not to tighten carbon monoxide standards. There are also cases where he found that industrial groups have standing to oppose environmental restrictions. One of those came last year when he was on a panel that unanimously found that logging interests had standing to challenge the designation of 9.5 million acresin California Oregon and Washington as a critical habitat for the northern spotted owl. He wrote that industry groups showed clearly that they would face economic harm if logging was banned in the area. There are exceptions in his record. Kavanaugh was part of a unanimous 2009 ruling that found road and transportation building groups did not have standing to challenge some EPA rules. If Kavanaugh is confirmed in time for the new court session the first case he'd hear would deal with an environmental issue. In the case the private owners of land used for logging in Louisiana object to their property's inclusion in the critical habitat for the dusky gopher frog which was added to the endangered species list in 2001 when fewer than 100 were known to be in existence all in southern Mississippi. None of the frogs has been spotted in Louisiana for more than 50 years. A federal appeals court found the land's inclusion as a critical habitat was appropriate.	False	False	False	False	True
Republican politicians often evoke the Bible when it suits their purposes. But they disregard some of its most important teachings when formulating policy. This includes the story of Noahs Ark.Noahs story holds powerful lessons for us today. We live in a time when it has become absolutely clear that global warming is starting to have a devastating affect on our lives. From super storms and floods like the disaster unfolding in Houston to droughts and fires of unprecedented magnitude the direct effects of climate change are now impossible to ignore. Rising sea levels will put whole swaths of coastal cities like Miami under water before the end of the century. Yet despite such ample evidence and warnings the Republican Party still chooses to ignore the reality. And sometimes I wonder whether any amount of evidence could convince you to act. After all we have a surplus of evidence. What is lacking is the political will of Republican elected officials like youto do anything about it. The catastrophe unfolding in Houston is yet another stark warning.People are losing their homes and their jobs. Some have lost their lives.Scientists expect monster storms like Hurricane Harvey to increase in number and intensify in magnitude as warmer temperatures disrupt weather systems around the world. As I write Hurricane Irma a terrifying superstorm with the highest wind speeds ever recorded in the Atlantic is cutting a destructive path through the Caribbean. Cities like Houston and New Orleans on the Gulf of Mexico face the threat of severe and life threatening impacts. We have a moral responsibility to address this urgent threat.But Republicans dont want to talk about the problem or even admit it exists. Instead the Republican strategy has consisted of aggressive denial of the facts coupled with staunch obstruction of any serious action to address the problem. Tragically no industry has done more to block crucial action to address climate change than the oil industry. In fact as Hurricane Harvey barreled towards Houston two Harvard researchers were simultaneously releasing a report that detailed how Exxon Mobil spent decades lying to the American people about climate change. Now Exxon along with other major oil corporations like Valero Shell Citgo and Phillips 66 has been forced to shut down its Houston refinery because of flooding from the storm. Port Arthur the planned terminus of the Keystone XL pipeline is completely under water. The executives of these oil companies are bearing witness to the boomerang effect of burning fossil fuels. They are glimpsing a future that millions of Americans will face as the climate crisis intensifies. Senators I hope that you will take some time to reflect. Few politicians have done more to prevent action on climate change than the two of youwhich I suspect may have something to do with the5.6 million youve taken from the oil and gas industry over the years.But with so many citizens of your state suffering the direct consequences of climate change I hope you can summon the moral courage to change course. We face an existential threat and in the face of this your specious economic arguments and lame fossil fuel endorsed excuses fall flat. We know that fighting climate change will reduce costs and create millions of jobs.We have the knowledge and technology needed to prevent future catastrophes.By doing so we will create broad prosperity cleaner air and water cheaper energy for all and most importantly we will save lives. Just as the evidence of crisis has made itself apparent in Texas so has the fact that clean energy provides a better path for all made itself evident in the Lone Star State. Texas leads the nation in wind power generation and its on the way to becoming a solar energy powerhouse. Senators its time for you to join the team that is trying to do the right thing not just in the short run but with an eye to our shared future. The people of Texas need you to get on board with the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century clean energy technology that will save lives create jobs and protect the amazing creation we all call home. On behalf of NextGen America please know that the people of Houston are in our thoughts and prayers. We are also fully engaged in fundraising efforts to assist our fellow citizens affected by this catastrophe. Words do not suffice in a tragedy like this. This is a time for action action to care for our fellow citizens in the face of disaster and action to prevent a systemic worsening of the climate crisis by heeding the warning and doing what is right.

Rashida Tlaib was nearly breathless. It was 130 on Tuesday afternoon and the newly elected congresswomantold me that shed been racing from one meeting to the next since she arrived in Washington for the weeklong new member orientation. But before 800 amthis morning the incoming representative from Detroit had still found time to give a pep talk to the Sunrise Movement agroup ofyouth activists who would soonstorm the office of Democratic leaderNancy Pelosi to demand that the party use its new House majority to address climate change. The night before Tlaib and Representative elect Alexandria Ocasio Cortez N.Y.who made headlines today by joining the protesters at Pelosis officehad stopped by St. Stephens church to meet with the activists on the eve of the demonstration. For me those young people I saw at that church that was me 15 years ago Tlaib said in a phone interview. I was fighting back against corporate greed and this constant disregard for public health. I wanted to come and help. The move is unusual for newly elected members of Congress but not so for Tlaib and Ocasio Cortez both of whom arrived in electoral politics through activism and community organizing and identify themselves as democratic socialists. And while Congress affords them a bigger platform to advance their progressive policy agenda their decision to join with the protesters during their first days in Washington makes clear that they have no intention of abandoning the strategies and principles that paved their way to Capitol Hill. Climate change has been a key issue for both Tlaib and Ocasio Cortez. As a Michigan state legislator Tlaib fought to reduceair and water pollution in Detroit and put environmental justice at the center of her campaign. Ocasio Cortez meanwhile has proposed a new congressional committee to develop a plan to transition the US economy away from fossil fuels reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and promote economic and environmental justice and equality. Tlaib views her workwith groups like the Sunrise Movement as a natural extension of the campaigns she and her fellow progressive built. I dont have to stop being an activist because Im a member of Congress she says. That movement work is critical to moving the needle. Indeed Tuesdays protests appear to have already had some success. Pelosiwho is courting support for her bid to be House speaker issued a statementreaffirming her support for reinstating a select committee to address climate change a new iteration of a House committee that met from 2007 to 2010 but was eliminated when Republicans took control of the House. That promise falls short of what Ocasio Cortez Tlaib and the Sunrise Movement protesters seeknamely the creation of a so called Green New Dealbut the attention has started a conversation between the new members and their partys longtime leader. How far these freshmen progressives can push their fellow Democrats remains uncertain. The Congressional Progressive Caucusa coalition ofliberallawmakers thatTlaib and Ocasio Cortez have joinedwill have a record 90 members in the new Congress. Theres a lot more of us now Tlaib says. Be hopeful.	True	False	False	True	True
President Donald Trump asserted that he had very high levels of intelligence and as such did not believe in the scientific consensus surrounding climate change in a sweeping interview with The Washington Post published Tuesday. One of the problems that a lot of people like myself we have very high levels of intelligence but were not necessarily such believers said Trump speaking to the Posts Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker. You look at our air and our water and its right now at a record clean. ... As to whether or not its man made and whether or not the effects that youre talking about are there I dont see it not nearly like it is. Trumps statements his latest in a long history of climate change denial go against the vast majority of scientists who say the planet has rapidly warmed since the Industrial Revolution and will continue to do so unless humanity is able to dramatically scale back greenhouse gas emissions. Without such action the planet faces a slew of devastating effects including a mass die off of coral reefsan increase in the severity of natural disasters such as wildfires and a global economic hit in the trillions of dollars according to a recent United Nations study. The White House released its own sweeping National Climate Assessment on the Friday after Thanksgiving. The 1656 page reportcompiled by 13 federal agencies and more than 300 researchers painted the bleakest portrait of the future United States yet noting that the country had already warmed 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit over the past century and will warm a further 3 degrees by 2100 unless fossil fuel use is scaled back. Predictions even said that warming could approach 9 degrees or more by the end of the century. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday that the recent National Climate Assessment was not based on facts. The report was compiled by 13 federal agencies and more than 300 researchers. Among threats to health and the environment the report also warned that sweeping damage would cut off as much as 10 percent of the U.S. economy. Its not based on facts. ... Its not data driven White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a news briefing Tuesday. Wed like to see something that is more data driven. Its based on modeling. I wrote the climate scenarios chapter myself so I can confirm it considers ALL scenarios from those where we go carbon negative before end of century to those where carbon emissions continue to rise Katharine Hayhoe a co author of the current assessment and director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University said in a tweet on Friday. The president has stayed firm on his anti climate rhetoric in recent days even after the devastating Camp fire in Northern California left at least 88 people dead. Trump toured the town of Paradise which was incinerated and said that his opinion of climate change hadnt shifted after the visit. He moved to lay blame on forest management policies during the visit instead even suggesting that raking would help stop the scourge of wildfires claims he appeared to repeat in his interview with the Post on Tuesday. The fire in California where I was if you looked at the floor the floor of the fire they have trees that were fallen they did no forest management no forest maintenance and you can light you can take a match like this and light a tree trunk when that thing is laying there for more than 14 or 15 months Trump said. You go to other places where they have denser trees its more dense where the trees are more flammable they dont have forest fires like this because they maintain.	True	False	False	False	False
President Trump on Monday once again backed off his previous claim that climate change is a hoax but would not say whether or not he believed it was a man made problem. Speaking at a Red Cross center in Georgia where he was touring areas devastated by last weeks Hurricane Michael Trump said there is something there in response to a question on climate change from a reporter. There is something there man made or not the president said before deflecting to note that there have been previous storms that were much more intense and destructive than the recent slew of hurricanes to hit the Southeast. Trumps comments come a day after CBS aired an interview on 60 Minutes with the president who said he doesn't want to put the U.S. at a disadvantage in responding to climate change. I think something's happening. Something's changing and it'll change back again he said. I don't think it's a hoax. I think there's probably a difference. But I don't know that it's man made. I will say this I don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs. Trump called climate change a hoax in November 2012 when he sent a tweet stating The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non competitive. He later said he was joking about the Chinese connection but in years since has continued to call global warming a hoax. I'm not denying climate change he said in the interview. But it could very well go back. You know we're talking about over a ... millions of years. As far as the climate changing back temperature records kept by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show that the world hasn't had a cooler than average year since 1976 or a cooler than normal month since the end of 1985. Trump's comments came just days after a Nobel Prize winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a warning that global warming would increase climate related risks to health livelihoods food security water supply human security and economic growth. The report detailed how Earth's weather health and ecosystems would be in better shape if the world's leaders could somehow limit future human caused warming. On Monday the president said that he had heard of the recent report and that hell have to take a look at it. Trump added I want crystal clear water I want the cleanest air on the planet. Citing concerns about the pact's economic impact Trump said in 2017 that the U.S. will leave the Paris climate accord. The agreement set voluntary greenhouse gas emission targets in an effort to lessen the impact of fossil fuels. Im truly an environmentalist he said on Monday in regards to leaving the Paris Agreement. But that doesnt mean we have to put one of our businesses out of business.

WASHINGTON AP An agency ethics official at the Environmental Protection Agency says Administrator Scott Pruitts lease of a Capitol Hill condo tied to a prominent fossil fuels lobbyist didnt violate federal ethics rules. A memo signed by Kevin Minoli contends that Pruitts 50 a night rental payments constitute a fair market rate. The memo was dated March 30 the day after ABC News first reported Pruitt lived last year in condo co owned by the wife of Steven Hart a registered lobbyist whose firm pushed EPA to relax pollution regulations. Pruitts college aged daughter stayed in the second bedroom while interning at the White House last summer. Minolis memo says the 50 a night rate would total 1500 for 30 nights a month which he deemed to be a fair price. Pruitts lease however required him to pay just for nights he occupied in the unit. Pruitt actually paid a total of 6100 over the six month period he leased the property an average of about 1000 a month. But current rental listings for two bedroom apartments in the neighborhood show they typically go for far more than what Pruitt paid. A two bedroom townhome on the same block as the one leased by Pruitt was advertised for rent on Monday at 3750 a month. Another two bedroom unit on the next block was advertised as available for 4740 a month. The lease authorized use by the administrator and his immediate family specifically including his spouse and children and consistent with that provision of the lease his immediate family did stay there when they were in Washington D.C. Minoli wrote. The lease did not require payment when the property was not utilized. Neither of these two provisions render the rental cost under the lease as something other than market value. EPA did not provide a copy of Pruitts lease and did not respond to questions about how Minoli determined what he considered to be the fair market rate for the neighborhood. Also left unanswered was how Pruitt came to rent a property tied to a lobbyist with business interests involving his agency. The unusual arrangement has attracted attention in Washington where Pruitt has been under increasing scrutiny for this frequent taxpayer funded travel which has included first class airline tickets. Though federal regulations typically require federal officials to fly in coach the EPA chief has said he needed to sit in premium seats due to security concerns. Walter Shaub who ran the U.S. Office of Government Ethics until last year rated EPAs legal justification of Pruitts living arrangements as Total Baloney. He jokingly tweeted on Friday that he would like to rent the Harts prime location condo for 50 a night. Ill only pay for nights I use it but need it held vacant all other nights wrote Shaub who has become a frequent critic of what he sees as ethical lapses in the Trump administration. has certified that these are standard terms at market rate so it shouldnt matter to you that I dont run EPA. A Republican who previously served as the state attorney general of Oklahoma Pruitt has long been a champion of the oil and gas industry. In the year he has served as the Trump administrations top environmental official Pruitt has moved to scrap gut or replace numerous environmental regulations opposed by the industry while boosting the continued burning of fossil fuels which is the primary cause of climate change. In a statement to The Associated Press last week Steven Hart described Pruitt is a casual friend from Oklahoma with whom he had only occasional contact. Records show the powerhouse lobbying firm where Hart serves as chairman and CEO Williams and Jensen PLLC represents companies that include Exxon Mobil and Cheniere Energy Inc. In December Pruitt and members of his staff spent about 40000 in taxpayer funds to fly to Morocco to help encourage the North African kingdom to import liquefied natural gas from the United States. Cheniere is currently the only exporter of liquefied natural gas from the continental United States. The firm also represents OGE Energy Corp. an electricity company serving Oklahoma and Arkansas. Copies of Pruitts daily calendar obtained by the AP through a public records request show that Pruitt meet in his EPA office with two top OGE executives and a registered lobbyist from Harts firm in March 2017 when he was living at the condo. In October EPA announced it would rewrite the Clean Power Plan an Obama era regulation that sought to limit planet warming carbon emissions from coal fired power plants like those operated by OGE which paid Harts firm 400000 in lobbying fees in 2017.

5 Major Crops In The Crosshairs Of Climate Change Climate change is coming like a freight train or a rising tide. And our food so dependent on rain and suitable temperatures sits right in its path. The plants that nourish us won't disappear entirely. But they may have to move to higher and cooler latitudes or farther up a mountainside. Some places may find it harder to grow anything at all because there's not enough water. Here are five foods and food growing places that will see the impact. Wheat source of bread and a foundation of life in much of the world will suffer from hotter temperatures and the country where the impact may be greatest also is among least well equipped to cope with a shortfall. India is likely to see a large drop in wheat production due to heat stress about 8 percent if average global temperatures rise by 1 degree Celsius according to one recent study. Temperatures are expected to rise more than that according to a recent report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change limiting climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius will require heroic and dramatic action. It will take significant cuts in greenhouse gas emissions within 15 years plus efforts to recapture some of the carbon that's already been emitted perhaps by planting new forests. Globally though wheat may not be in short supply in a warmer world. Russia which is already a major wheat exporter may be able to expand the amount of land devoted to this crop. Despite Georgia's claim to be the Peach State California is the country's biggest peach producer. Farmers there grow about half of the country's fresh peaches and almost all of the fruit that's canned and processed in other ways. Many fruit trees including peaches have a peculiar requirement. If they don't experience enough chill during wintertime they get confused and don't bloom properly. No bloom no harvest. The peach trees currently grown in California's Central Valley require about 700 chilling hours during the winter. But scientists are predicting that by the end of the century only 10 percent of the valley will reliably see that much chilling. And even if plant breeders create peach varieties that need less chilling there's another problem Peach trees also yield less fruit when it gets too hot in summertime. Coffee can't take freezing temperatures but it doesn't like extreme heat either at least the highly prized Arabica type doesn't. So it's mainly grown on relatively cool mountainsides in the tropics. Brazil is the biggest coffee producer in the world by far but as the globe warms up most of its main coffee growing regions probably won't be suitable for growing this crop anymore due to heat as well as more frequent rainstorms. Coffee could move to cooler parts of the country but researchers don't think those new growing areas will make up for what's lost. Meanwhile rising temperatures could threaten native coffee trees that grow wild in the forests of Ethiopia and central Africa. The wild trees represent an irreplaceable storehouse of coffee's original genetic diversity. The world's commercial coffee trees are genetically very similar to each other and those genetically diverse wild trees could be the source of genetic traits that plant breeders may need in order to create commercial trees that can thrive in tomorrow's climate. Some of the wild trees however are preserved in gene banks in Ethiopia and Latin America. Nothing says Iowa quite like fields of corn. Climate models though see a different future. They're predicting that a warming climate will bring several changes most of them bad for growing corn. Rain will come less often and when it comes the storms will be more intense neither of which is helpful for a crop that demands frequent rains but doesn't do a good job of preventing soil erosion. In addition corn suffers when it gets too hot especially when it's too hot at night. Add it all up and one study estimates that corn yields in Iowa will fall substantially anywhere from 15 percent to an astounding 50 percent. By 2100 the Corn Belt is going to be in Canada not in the United States says Jason Clay senior vice president for food and markets at the World Wildlife Fund. So what will replace corn on Iowa's fertile land? According to one study by the end of the century this part of the Midwest will be more suited for growing cotton soybeans grass and forests. California the biggest single source of America's fresh vegetables and nuts and the primary source of almonds for the entire world is a dramatic illustration of how subtle shifts in climate can have huge effects. California's farms rely heavily on snow that piles up in the Sierra Nevada mountains during the winter and then slowly melts during the summer delivering a vital flow of water to the state's irrigation canals. As the climate warms though winter precipitation will arrive more often as rain and the snow that does fall will melt much more quickly leaving farmers scrambling for water to keep crops alive in late summer. Also there will be more variation from year to year wet years will be wetter and dry years will be even dryer. Both trends increase the chances that from time to time farmers will face catastrophic shortages of water. And that's especially bad for tree crops of which almonds are the biggest because losing an orchard is much more devastating than losing a single crop of say tomatoes. California's farmers may be forced to reduce the amount of land devoted to orchards since there there's a chance that they will not survive a major drought.	True	True	False	True	True
The Trump administration will repeal the Clean Power Plan the centerpiece of President Barack Obamas effort to fight climate change and will ask the public to recommend ways it could be replaced according to an internal Environmental Protection Agency document. The draft proposal represents the administrations first substantive step toward rolling back the plan which was designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector after months of presidential tweets and condemnations of Mr. Obamas efforts to reduce climate warming pollution. But it also lays the groundwork for new presumably weaker regulations by asking for the public and industry to offer ideas for a replacement. In 2016 when it launched the plan at Obamas behest the EPA declared that theClean Power Plan was a vital cost effective way of combating climate change which would ultimately benefit the U.S. consumer. However an independent study by the Manhattan Institute showed this to be nonsense. The EPAs cost benefit analysis wasfallacious it had drastically underestimated the costs which it claimed would be 9 billion a year but which the Manhattan Institute showed would be closer to 40 billion and it would make no measurable difference to climate change. Hence Trumps election trail promise and executive orderin March this yearrequesting EPA chief Scott Pruitt to rescind the CPP. This was part ofa wider war on the Green Blob which has also involved withdrawing from the UNs Paris climate accord. Had it been implemented the CPP would have required U.S. power plants to lower their carbon emissions by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels. Since carbon dioxide is a natural by product of almost every industrial process the knock on damage to the U.S economy in the form of lost jobs and higher energy prices would have been huge. Note though that the CPP is not being scrapped altogether but rather being delayed indefinitely through judicial fudge. Janet McCabe who headed the EPAs Office of Air and Radiation under Obama said an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking could take years meaning the replacement for CPP could be a long way off. It certainly will draw the process out she said. Some conservative groups have urged the EPA to scrap the CPP without replacing it effectively ending U.S. regulation of carbon emissions. But some industry groups want a replacement to give utilities regulatory certainty and avoid possible lawsuits by environmental groups. So while its good news that the CPP will probably never be implemented the bad news is how difficult it is even for a determinedly skeptical president like Trump to unravel environmental regulation. Even within his own cabinet there are numerous siren voices Javanka Secretary of State Tillerson Economics advisor Gary Cohn urging Trump to maintain his predecessors disastrous green policies. This fudge isnt perfect and it still doesnt solve the problem of the EPAs Obama era Endangerment Finding on carbon dioxide which ludicrously treats a harmless life enhancing trace gas as an existential threat. But at least its a step in the right direction the green blob just lost another of its tentacles.	True	False	False	False	False
We cannot live in a world that is burning one young woman said that is melting. Climate change is already affecting millions of people another young woman claimed. This could lead to mass extinction. We are not here to guilt individuals that forgot to recycle a cup last week another young woman said. We are here to hold cowardice sic politicians accountable who have caused this damage by turning their heads in fear. Those 12 years left to stop carbon emissions a young woman yelled. Is now down to 10 years and five months. One young woman said she wanted to acknowledge Hurricane Dorian a storm that is still in the Atlantic Ocean and is not expected to make landfall somewhere in Florida until early next week. It is ravaging the coast of Florida the girl said. It is not a coincidence. It isa direct impact of the climate crisis. The youths held signs that read Greed Kills Help My Home is on Fire and 527 Years of Indigenous Resistance and chanted in between speeches phrases such as What do we want? Climate Justice. When do we want it? Now. No more coal no more oil keep your carbon in the soil and Waters are rising people are dying. A speaker said that the protest was not the goal of the movement by a catalyst for action including a planned global climate strike on September 20 just three days ahead of a U.N. climate summit that is expected to draw leaders from around the world and where Thunberg will be a special guest and speaker. The speaker listed the groups demands which will be presented at the U.N. summit A just and livable world where fossil fuels are left out of every decision around the world 100 percent renewable energy around the globe and holding polluters accountable for causing the climate crisis. The publicist for the New York City protest refused to speak with Breitbart News when an inquiry was made about Thunbergs appearance and about Alexandria Villaseor a 14 year old who claims she has been protesting every Friday at the United Nations for 38 weeks. Reporters on the scene were kept from interviewing Thunberg during the protest. Thunberg gained international attention when she cut school a year ago to appear before the Swedish parliament where she called on young people around the world to cut school every Friday to protest climate change. It is not clear how many students in New York are still on summer break or skipped classes but Thunbergs publicity team announced that the 16 year old is taking a sabbatical from her high school studies to concentrate on her activism. After attending the U.N. summit Thunberg and her father will travel in the United States Canada and Mexico before attending a second U.N. climate change summit in Chile in December. Thunberg has said she is not sure how she will get back to Sweden and no details have been released on how she will travel around the North and South American continents without the help of fossil fuel powered transportation.

The Democratic candidates sounded the alarm on climate change in the first presidential debates but the discussion in June was so limited that they never really got into the details of how theyd solve the crisis. It was a different story this time around. It took more than an hour to get there Tuesday night but during the 12 minutes of discussion of global warming policy two of the frontrunnersElizabeth Warren and Bernie Sandersbecame the first candidates to substantively embrace versions of a Green New Deal in the debates. The concept of a Green New Dealpushed by lawmakers like Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D N.Y.has become a favorite idea for progressives. It outlines a vision for economic infrastructure and clean energy investment while aggressively ramping down to net zero emissions as soon as possible. Elizabeth Warren didnt actually use the words Green Neal Deal or tout AOCs specific resolution Tuesday night but she did capture its ethos by touting her plan for investing 2 trillion over 10 years in green manufacturing. The climate crisis is the existential crisis for our world she said. I have a plan for a green industrial policy that takes advantage of the fact that we do what we do best and that is innovate and create. She promised that her plan would produce roughly 1.2 million manufacturing jobs. This could revitalize huge cities across this country she added. Bernie Sanders also embraced the Green New Deal on stage albeit briefly. The Green New Deal is a bold idea he said. We can create millions of good paying jobs. We can rebuild communities in rural America that have been devastated. As he often does Sanders pledged to fight back againstthe fossil fuel industry noting that it continues to receive tax breaks and subsidies adding up to hundreds of billions of dollars globally. I get a little bit tired of Democrats afraid of big ideas. Republicans are not afraid of big ideas he said. Please dont tell me that we cannot take on the fossil fuel industry. Other candidates on stage were far more critical of Green New Deal policies. Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney pointed to his plan for a carbon price and investing in technology to capture carbon from the air. But he argued a Green New Deal would tie progress on climate to other things that are completely unrelated to climate like universal health care and guaranteed jobs. Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooperwho has advocated working collaboratively with the oil and gas industry to address climate changecalled Green New Deal proposals a disaster at the ballot box. You might as well FedEx the election to Donald Trump Hickenlooper said. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock expressed doubt that such an ambitious program could make it through Congress. Lets not just talk about plans that are written for press releases that will go nowhere else if we cant even get a Republican to acknowledge that the climate is changing he said. Nearly every Democratic presidential candidate has now released a climate change plan or at least part of a plan. Climate change has consistently ranked as one of the top concerns among Democratic primary votersand polls suggest that Trumps climate denial is deeply unpopular. The relatively brief segment devoted to climate change Tuesday is unlikely to satisfy environmental activists. They have pressed for an official DNC climate change debate because they argue its needed to finally allot candidates the time to debate their plans in depthand to highlight the fact that President Donald Trump has no answers himself. Frankly I dont think we see an indicator that candidates arent willing to talk about solutions Greenpeaces US climate campaigns director Janet Redman told me after the last debate in June. But I think they need more time to state the case.	False	False	False	False	False
India's southern state of Tamil Nadu is poised to become a global leader in wind power according to a new report. But first the state must overcome its addiction to coal writes Nityanand Jayaraman. The report by the US based Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis predicts that by 2027 more than half of Tamil Nadu's power will be generated by zero emissions technologies notably solar and wind. The state's current capacity to generate wind power 7.85 gigawatts GW is already impressive considering it is higher than that of Denmark or Sweden. But the report estimates that it could double over the next decade and that solar installations too could increase six fold to reach 13.5GW. If that happens clean renewable energy would account for 67 of Tamil Nadu's capacity which could revive the state's debt ridden utility. But in order to harvest that potential Tamil Nadu needs to transform its power sector. Tamil Nadu's population is three times that of Australia and its per capita GDP is on a par with Sri Lanka and Ukraine. It could prove to be an example of how emerging economies can grow while slashing their carbon emissions. Assuming Tamil Nadu's GDP will grow at an annual rate of 7 the report suggests that much of this growth can be driven by renewables. Installation and operating costs for wind and solar power have dropped low enough to compete with established but dirty sources of power such as coal. But that is where reality tempers the possibilities. The report argues that not only does Tamil Nadu not need coal or nuclear power but that these projects are financially fraught. Electricity from new coal power plants is likely to be twice as expensive as solar or wind power. But despite the bleak financial prospects Tamil Nadu currently has 22.5GW of coal power plants in the pipeline. Pursuing these ventures will weaken the state utility's finances and its ability to invest in smarter cleaner alternatives. There are other challenges too. Wind power can be generated only from May to October. Even during those months production cannot reach its peak because the state does not have a large enough grid to convey excess electricity to other states. So they will have to slow down generation from other sources. This also means the state is unable to import cheap power from other states during the remaining seven months when wind power is not feasible. Work is afoot to change this but its not guaranteed that the improvements will ensure that the grid can cope with the predicted generation. Integrating power from seasonal sources like wind requires a smart grid one with a sophisticated system of supply and management that can adjust to variations in demand. On this count too Tamil Nadu has a long way to go. But the biggest limiting factor for the state is likely to be water. Between climate change and reckless exploitation and pollution of rivers streams and lakes Tamil Nadu is staring at a bleak water future. At least 60 of groundwater resources in the state are assessed as over exploited critical or semi critical according to India's Central Ground Water Board. In April 2017 Tamil Nadu farmers camped out in India's capital Delhi staging dramatic protests stuffing dead rats in their mouths stripping themselves naked in front of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home and drinking their own urine to underscore the intensity of the drought back home. In June 2017 villagers in Tamil Nadu's parched Ramanathapuram district were protesting against a solar power plant they alleged that more than 200000 litres of scarce water was being extracted illegally from bore wells to clean the 250000 solar modules daily. Utility scale solar farms massive projects that supply power to the gird such as the one in Ramanathapuram need to be re evaluated especially if they are to run in areas where water is scarce. The report predicts that Tamil Nadu will have 10.3GW of utility scale solar installations by the end of this decade and only about 2GW of rooftop installations. Given that both the availability of sunlight and the demand for electricity are decentralised it makes sense to maximise rooftop solar installations rather than to invest in large solar parks. The overall direction if not the magnitude and rate of change laid out in the report is not just possible but essential both financially and environmentally. A healthy and environmentally sustainable future requires more than just switching from dirty coal to wind or solar power. But the bigger challenge lies not in decoupling growth from carbon emissions but in decoupling human wellbeing and progress from growth.	False	True	False	True	False
In his Message for the World Day of Prayer for the Care of Creation the pope adopted the apocalyptic language encouraged by climate alarmists to frighten people into taking action. Too many of us act like tyrants with regard to creation he declared. Let us make an effort to change and to adopt more simple and respectful lifestyles! Now is the time to abandon our dependence on fossil fuels and move quickly and decisively towards forms of clean energy and a sustainable and circular economy. Let us also learn to listen to indigenous peoples whose age old wisdom can teach us how to live in a better relationship with the environment he said. Recent studies have shown that the language of climate change and global warming do not stir up an emotional reaction in people and so climate alarmists have issued an appeal for the use of more powerful expressions to provoke people to action. Last April a team of advertising consultants from SPARK Neuro released the results of astudysuggesting that worn out expressions such as climate change do not frighten people enough whereas stronger vocabulary such as climate crisis and environmental collapse produced a significantly stronger emotional response. The expression climate crisis for instance got a 60 percent greater emotional response from listeners than climate change the study found. In its research SPARK Neuro measured physiological data such as brain activity and palm sweat to quantify peoples emotional reactions to stimuli. Of six different options global warming and climate change performed the worst beaten handily by climate crisis environmental destruction weather destabilization and environmental collapse. The pope has apparently joined the climate alarmists in employing more incendiary language dropping his former references to climate change to speak of a climate emergency and an environmental crisis in Sundays message. He also underscored the forthcoming United Nations Climate Action Summit as of particular importance while proposing that governments will have the responsibility there of showing the political will to take drastic measures to achieve as quickly as possible zero net greenhouse gas emissions. Referring specifically to fires in the Amazon region Francis called on everyone to take up these opportunities to respond to the cry of the poor and of our earth! Egoism and self interest have turned creation a place of encounter and sharing into an arena of competition and conflict he said. In this way the environment itself is endangered something good in Gods eyes has become something to be exploited in human hands. Deterioration has increased in recent decades constant pollution the continued use of fossil fuels intensive agricultural exploitation and deforestation are causing global temperatures to rise above safe levels he said. The pontiff went on to enumerate the effects of climate change an increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather phenomena the desertification of the soil melting of glaciers scarcity of water neglect of water basins and the considerable presence of plastic and microplastics in the oceans. All of these testify to the urgent need for interventions that can no longer be postponed he warned.	True	True	True	True	True
In an effort to suppress federal climate research the Trump administration newstrump administration will direct state agencies to no longer consider worst case scenarios of global warming. Climate modelers working for federal agencies will only be permitted to forecast to 2040 decades before the as much as 8C degrees of global warming that could take place by 2100 if we continue on our current path. William Happer most recently famous for complaining trump science advisor compares climate science 1793497686 that the demonization of carbon dioxide really differs little from the Nazi persecution of the Jews will lead a team charged with reviewing the science produced by government researchers no doubt hunting for references to the disastrous sea level rise crop failures and health impacts continued warming stands to create. The irony in all of this is that Trump Happer and company may have a firmer grasp on the epic scope of these climate projections than many Democrats. As Naomi Klein argues even the rights fervent conspiracy theorists tend to understand at some level how profound the implications of this crisis are for business as usual which has distributed its profits among elites of both parties. Members of Trumps cabinet Klein has written donald trump tax cuts climate change republican ideology capitalism with their desperate need to deny the reality of global warming or belittle its implications nonetheless understand something that is fundamentally true. To avert climate chaos we need to challenge the free market fundamentalism that has conquered the world since the 1980s. For all their bluster and junk science Republican decision makers have a clear sense for their own self interest and just how much is at stake for them and the rest of the 1. Consider Happer himself a retired physicist who has spent his post academy days hopping between various climate denying thinktanks a good many of them funded by the fossil fuel industry. In 2015 Greenpeace activists duped Happer into agreeing to write a report on the benefits of carbon dioxide for a fictional oil company. The real coal company Peabody Energy has paid him to deliver testimony at a state hearing in Minnesota and Happer has joined hands with groups like the Heritage Foundation the Cato Institute and the Competitive Enterprise Institute all recipients of ample industry funding to bolster Trumps agenda and cast doubt on the scientific consensus. As the New York Times reported in its article on the White Houses new climate plans both Happer and John Bolton who tapped him for the administration have received generous support from the Mercers the rightwing family credited with both spreading climate denial and helping fuel the opioid epidemic. We cant know whether Happer genuinely believes the nonsense hes spouting or is just being paid well enough to sound like he does. The answer doesnt really matter. Any clear eyed assessment of what the science is telling us spells out who the winners and losers of rapid decarbonization would be. To cap warming at around 2C a threshold many already dealing with climate impacts argue is too high about three quarters of known fossil fuel reserves will need to be kept underground a reality that if realized as public policy would crater the stock price of energy companies. Climate scientist Kevin Anderson has estimated that if the top 10 of greenhouse gas emitters were to live like the average European an improvement even for many of us in the United States global emissions could decline by a third. It is possible climate change new ipcc report wxcindex.html with the laws of chemistry and physics according to IPCC scientists to limit warming to the boldly ambitious target of 1.5C. The problem is our politics and how much of a stranglehold the fossil fuel executives with the most to lose from decarbonization have over them. Establishment Democrats meanwhile are asleep at the wheel. The pitch for taking on the climate challenge is a compelling one for reasons well beyond the fact that it could prevent runaway catastrophe. The Green New Deal promises a well paid job for everyone who wants one a real mass transit system clean and affordable energy and universal healthcare a necessity as people leave their jobs to find new work in the transition away from fossil fuels. While several Democratic primary contenders have embraced the Green New Deal and begun proposing their own plans the frontrunner in that race Joe Biden and the Democrats congressional leadership have been cooler toward it offering neither a decarbonization plan nor a compelling reason for voters to get behind them come 2020. Thats a dead end for the planet but also for the partys political prospects. With Donald Trump at their helm Republicans will keep denying climate change because it represents a dire threat to their fossil fuel donors bottom lines. Democratic leadership would do well to follow the lead of their partys insurgent progressive wing and take the climate threat as seriously. 	True	False	False	False	False
On Thursday President Donald J. Trump rejected failed former President Obamasdisastrous Paris global warmingdeal that sought to burden our economy with heavy regulations and taxes all to push the lefts global warming hysteria. In a Rose Garden speech President Trump said he rejected the global warming agreement because I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh not Paris words that the global warming alarmists cannot comprehend. Now a new report sheds some more light into why President Trump rejected the globalist scam and its incrediblespecifically he wanted to stick it to holier than thou elites in America specifically leftists who flyaround in private jets drive SUVs and live in massive mansions yet lecture Americans about their environmental impact. This is religion for the political left and our supporters are constantly being asked to change their behavior a top White House official told Axios who added that snarky comments from European leaders also encouraged Trump to withdraw. The White House official said Trump resented the corporate critics who ride in fossil fuel guzzling planes and SUVs then act holier than thou according to Axios. Trump announced he would withdraw the U.S. from the Paris agreement which the Obama administration joined in 2016 after years of negotiating with United Nations member countries. Some 147 countries have ratified the Paris agreement. Trump said the Paris agreement was poorly negotiated and would harm the U.S. economy. Trump said the deal transferred wealth from the U.S. to economic rivals like China and India. I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh not Paris Trump said. Its also important to note that the Obama administration didnt have the authority to commit the United States to a treaty without being ratified by the Senate a crucial point that the liberal media deliberately ignores in order to attack President Trump. Its been rumored that Trumps liberal son in law Jared Kushner as well as his daughter Ivanka and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson pushed the President to remain in the global warming deal but the President chose the American people instead. For years liberals like Al Gore and Leonardo DiCaprio have lectured the American public on global warming yet these hypocrites have bigger carbon footprints than millions of poorer peoplecombined traveling around the world in private jets accompanied by a fleet of SUVs. Throughout much of the 2016 campaign then candidate Donald Trump railed against corporate and global elitists who want to dictate their liberal agenda onto the American public with no understanding of how such liberal policies would harm our economy and the Americanpeople. President Trumps decision to pull out of the Paris climate deal is a giant middle finger to elitists all around the world who want America to suffer simply to promote their global warming alarmism.

Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil has also spoken in favor of keeping a seat at the table in the climate pact and in recent days major corporations have stepped forward to embrace that position. While no decision has been made experts tracking it say that view is gaining traction. We do not currently believe the Trump administration plans to withdraw from either Paris agreement wrote Kevin Book an analyst at ClearView Energy Partners a Washington firm in a memo to clients on Monday. While Mr. Trump does not have the power to undo a multilateral United Nations accord he could withdraw the worlds largest economy from the pact weakening it substantially. Such a move would win cheers from the nations most powerful conservative political advocates and give Mr. Trump bragging rights in coal country. But withdrawing from the landmark accord that committed nearly every nation to take action against planet warming emissions could create diplomatic blowback while weakening American leadership in arenas far afield from energy and the environment. Besides keeping the United States name on the accord does not obligate the Trump administration to abide by the ambitious emissions control pledges of Mr. Trumps predecessor Barack Obama. At least one senior White House climate policy adviser George David Banks has advocated staying in the agreement while replacing the Obama plan with a weaker more industry friendly pledge. Over recent weeks Mr. Banks has asked top officials at several major corporations including Exxon Mobil who have similar views to submit letters to the White House confirming their support of staying in the Paris deal even if in a modified form. In response Peter Trelenberg the manager of environmental policy and planning at Exxon Mobil wrote to Mr. Banks Exxon Mobil supports the Paris agreement as an effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change. Royal Dutch Shell and BP European companies with significant investments in the United States have also endorsed the accord. Last month Representative Kevin Cramer a Republican from oil gas and coal rich North Dakota wrote The U.S. should present a new pledge that does no harm to our economy. Mr. Cramer an early supporter of Donald J. Trump advised Mr. Trump on energy issues during his presidential campaign. Colin Marshall the chief executive of Cloud Peak a major coal producer in Wyoming the nations largest coal mining state also wrote to Mr. Trump By remaining in the Paris agreement albeit with a much different pledge on emissions you can help shape a more rational international approach to climate policy. Regardless of his decision Mr. Trump has already undermined the United States ability to meet its Paris pledge. Mr. Obama declared that the United States would reduce its planet warming carbon pollution about 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. Its primary policy for meeting that target would be the Clean Power Plan a set of Environmental Protection Agency regulations designed to shutter hundreds of heavily polluting coal fired power plants the nations chief source of greenhouse emissions. Last month Mr. Trump directed Scott Pruitt the head of the Environmental Protection Agency to begin the legal process of dismantling the Clean Power Plan. Whether or not the United States remains in the Paris pact it almost certainly will not be able to meet its pledged pollution reduction targets. Mr. Pruitt has emerged as a leading voice for withdrawal from the Paris deal. Last week he told Fox News Its something we need to exit. That reflects the views of powerful conservative political advocacy groups such as Americans for Prosperity which is funded by the influential libertarian brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch. What we say to the White House is that its clearly a terrible agreement for the American people said Tim Phillips the president of Americans for Prosperity. That view is also backed by economists at the Heritage Foundation the conservative think tank that has supplied the Trump administration with many of its policy proposals. Harold G. Hamm the chief executive of Continental Resources and a Trump campaign adviser has also condemned the pact. Cancel the Paris climate treaty and any other agreements entered into unilaterally and without the consent of Congress Mr. Hamm wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump before his inauguration. Bob Murray the chief executive of the coal company Murray Energy who is personally close with the president has also strongly criticized the deal. Mr. Book the analyst noted that the risks of withdrawing from the Paris deal include not only diplomatic ill will but also the possibility of trade reprisals. Countries that tax emissions of carbon dioxide pollution could place a carbon tariff on imports of American made goods. The European Union currently charges polluters fees for carbon emissions while China Mexico and Canada are in the process of carrying out such programs. If the U.S. were to pull out it would do so in the context that would invite trade reprisals Mr. Book said. It could lead to a carbon tariff trade war. Daniel M. Bodansky an expert in international environmental agreements at Arizona State University said that remaining in the Paris deal but weakening the United States commitment could still have the effect of generating some ill will but without the repercussions of trade sanctions. They could just submit a new plan he said. People internationally would not be happy but theyd be a lot less unhappy than if the U.S. actually pulled out.	True	True	False	True	True
Speaking at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow slammed the progressive proposal that was recently introduced by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts. Kudlow said the deal will knock out energy transportation airlines jobs businesses. We'll probably lose 10 to 15 of our GDP. It's remarkable. The package of legislation is aimed at among other things addressing climate change. It would phase out fossil fuel use and calls for the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions and pollution in agriculture transportation manufacturing and construction. The deal describes a 10 year economic mobilization that would overhaul the nation's infrastructure and build new layers into the existing social safety net. It calls for the creation of millions of new high wage jobs to help wipe out poverty. The resolution co sponsored by several Democrats running for President in 2020 has been heavily criticized by those on the right. Kudlow likened the deal to socialism and called for the American people to put socialism on trial and convict it. The resolution proposes providing all people of the United States with i high quality health care ii affordable safe and adequate housing iii economic security and iv access to clean water clean air healthy and affordable food and nature. The deal proposes guaranteeing a job with a family sustaining wage adequate family and medical leave paid vacations and retirement security to all people of the United States. Kudlow said universal health care and ending private insurance were also crazy ideas citing high costs. He said guaranteed jobs free to those who don't want to work probably cost 45 trillion. Earlier this week Ivanka Trump a senior White House adviser and the President's daughter was asked about the Green New Deal proposal and what she would say to people who are enticed by the proposal's job guarantee. In response Ivanka Trump said I don't think most Americans in their heart want to be given something adding People want to work for what they get so I think this idea of a guaranteed minimum is not something most people want. Ocasio Cortez fired back on Twitter and said A living wage isn't a gift it's a right. Workers are often paid far less than the value they create.	True	False	False	False	False

Over 250000 Americans and 500 organizations submitted comments rejecting the US Department of Agricultures USDA proposal to approve genetically engineered eucalyptus trees for planting. If approved the trees would be planted in seven southern states. Public comments on the USDAs draft environmental impact statement dEIS closed on Wednesday. The agency will now evaluate the comments for a final review on whether to approve the GE trees. Activists from the South Pacific Islands Southern Asia and North and South America weighed in rejecting all genetically engineered trees including field trials. Critics of the dEIS said the USDA downplayed the risks posed by the GE trees. The agency predicts GE eucalyptus plantations would cover over 1 million across seven states from coastal South Carolina to eastern Texas. The GE eucalyptus trees developed by biotech companies such as FuturaGene and ArborGen are designed to tolerate freezing temperatures and to help feed demand for pulp and paper production biomass pellets for electricity and fuel for cars. Anne Petermann executive director at the Global Justice Ecology Project said the tradition has been for the government to rubberstamp genetically engineered organisms but this would be the first time they are approving a genetically engineered forest tree. She said ArborGen asked for approval to legalize the trees six years ago. They USDA are really taking their time with it becuase they know there is overwhelming public opposition to the plan Petermann told RT. Petermann said there is a lack of independent research on the long term or even short term consequences of putting genetically engineered trees out into the environment and that the risks could be significant. We are talking about forest ecosystems that have evolved over millions of years Petermann said. Planting eucalyptus trees with mutations in their genomes how are these organisms going to interact with the forest? How are they going to interact with soil micro organisms? Those studies have not been done and that is one of the major points in the comments. Petermann said if the studies were to be done they would have to be carried out over the full life of the tree between 50 to 100 years. As that is not likely to happen she said there is no way to know the full scope of the risks. Eucalyptus trees are the number one industrial tree plantation used in Latin America Africa and Asia traditionally in tropical areas where commerce appreciates their fast growth and versatility. The forest products industry is worth 400 billion a year. This technology is worth billions of dollars a year. If you can increase yields by 40 percent you can greatly reduce prices. Eucalyptus today are harvested at seven years in Brazil we are looking to produce the same sized trees in five and a half years Stanley Hirsch chief executive of the Israeli biotech company FuturaGene told the Guardian in 2012 over its plans to plant GM eucalyptus in Brazil. Documented as an invasive species around the world the trees have escaped the limits of their plantations in South Africa and shown up in native grasslands and in Chile where they are showing up in the forests. In the US the trees only grow in Southern Florida and California hence the need for a genetically engineered variety to withstand temperature variations in other states. Petermann said another red flag is wildfires. She points to the massive wildlife that hit Portugal last month that left 60 people dead and one that happened in Chile in January. Both were fed by eucalyptus plantations. Eucalyptus is extremely flammable said Petermann. Combine that with dry conditions which these trees exacerbate because they drink so much you end with these incredible firestorms. The US southeast is already experiencing repeated droughts it is already experiencing heatwaves it is the last place to plant a eucalyptus plantation. Among other commentators was former NASA scientist Kate Cato who lives in the US south and has mapped parts of Mars. She said it was clear that the planet once had rivers and great amounts of water and possibly an atmosphere similar to ours but a global catastrophe had happened. She said the effects of invasive species such as kudzu lionfish and Australian pines have already caused chaos in the southern states where they lack predators and displace native plants and animals and already cost the states millions of dollars in losses and eradication.

The executive order titled Promoting Domestic Manufacturing and Job Creation Policies and Procedures Relating to Implementation of Air Quality Standards reverses an Obama era decision. The 2015 decision allowed the EPA to intervene in states that fail to meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards forcing them to adopt federal regulatory plans to reduce ozone emissions that generally come from power plants refineries and cement factories. It opens the door to drastic changes in how science is used to set clean air rules disqualifying huge amounts of peer reviewed public health research in favor of industry backed studies in a move that builds on steps EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has already taken. The order requires the EPA to speed up reviews of state plans to reduce air pollution setting a strict 18 month deadline and complete reviews of all pre construction permits for industry within a year. Construction permitting is primarily a state level issuethe language in the order critics say appears to be a dog whistle to polluters suggesting the EPA would pull back on any oversight. The purpose is that if states make determinations that are somewhat less than the rigor of what might be expected EPA wont second guess it Stan Meiburg a former acting deputy EPA administrator who spent 39 years at the agency told HuffPost by phone. Its a go ahead for industry that if they take their best shot at states the EPA wont be getting in the way. The orderinstructs the EPA to consider what countries that dont border the United States are doing to reduce pollution allowing the agency to compare U.S. regulations to those in developing nations like China and India. It also directs Pruitt to allow states to trade pollution permits a move environmentalists warn could make offsets nearly impossible to track and police. In what could be the most controversial part the order requires the EPAs science advisers to consider the downside of cleaner air rulessomething for which industry groups have clamored for years. They argue the policies could raise electricity costs and make things like air conditioning more expensive. That directive is likely to prompt watchdog groups to sue. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in 2001 in a decision written by late Justice Antonin Scalia that the EPA cannot consider the costs of implementation when setting air quality standards. It marks the latest assault on clean air rules putting poor people and communities of color particularly at risk. People living below the poverty line were exposed to 1.35 times more particulate matter than those living above it according to a landmark EPA study released in February. People of color breathe in 1.2 times more particulate matter pollution and black people in particular are on average exposed to 1.54 times more particulate matter pollution than the general pollution. The National Association of the Advancement of Colored People released a report in February that found black people are exposed to air that is 38 percent more polluted than white people on average and they are 75 percent more likely to live in communities abutting industrial sites. People who are most affected by air pollution are the most vulnerable and these policy changes would mean even less protection for those people Janet McCabewho served as the assistant administrator for the EPAs Office of Air and Radiation until 2017 told HuffPost by phone. It could mean yet more pollution in their neighborhoods. The new order could put the administration at loggerheads with California regulators again. But the quiet rollout of the memorandum avoided swift criticisms. The California Air Resources Board told HuffPost the agency had not yet reviewed the ordered by Thursday afternoon. This is yet another example of this administration selling out our future to industry polluters its nothing more than a naked attempt to attack science gut our clean air protections and put polluter profits ahead of our health Sara Jordan a legislative representative at the nonpartisan League of Conservation Voters said in a statement.

Trump regularly brags about making Americas air cleaner but evidence from his own Environmental Protection Agency EPA shows the opposite is happening The air we breathe is getting dirtier. New EPA data shows that since 2016 a decades long trend of improving air quality has started to backslide. In both 2017 and 2018 the number of unhealthy air days in metropolitan areas increased 15 compared to the last four years of President Obamas administration the Associated Press reported Tuesday. That's the exact opposite of what Trump regularly claims. During his embarrassing trip to Ireland in early June Trump said We have the cleanest air in the world in the United States and its gotten better since Im president. At his big rally Tuesday in Orlando Trump made a similar false claim We have among the cleanest and sharpest crystal clean youve heard me say it I want it crystal clean air and water anywhere on Earth. Air pollution leads to the premature death of 100000 Americans every year the AP reports and Trumps own EPA shows not only worse air pollution but a significant increase in the two worst categories very unhealthy and hazardous conditions. During the Trump administration U.S. cities saw air pollution in one of these two categories nearly 140 times which is almost three times as often as the average from 2013 to 2016. In fact the AP notes that the four years from 2013 and 2016 Obama's second term in office were a clean air heyday for America that boasted the fewest unhealthy air days since 1980. That heyday appears to be over for now. To make matters worse on Wednesday the EPA finalized what will be its biggest climate policy rollback according to the Washington Post. The new rule will allow coal plants to spew more pollution into the air than a previous rule put in place by President Obama. The new rule is really a dereliction of duty moral ethical but also legal Andres Restrepo a lawyer with the Sierra Club's Environmental Law Program told the Post. Scientists are unclear as to the exact reasons air pollution has gotten worse under Trump but they say its very clear that his policies will make the situation worse. There is zero reason to expect any other outcome than worsening air quality if Trump continues to roll back regulations Neil Donahue an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University told the AP. While Trump has been in office the air has gotten dirtier. His lies dont make it cleaner and his policies are on track to make it worse. Published with permission of The American Independent.

There is a wave of energy related ballot initiatives for voters to weigh in on this election year. Voters from Washington to Florida will be able to partake in important energy policy decisions for their states. Will Washington become the first state to tax carbon dioxide emissions? Will California undo a gas tax increase passed just seven months ago? The Daily Caller News Foundation lays out everything one needs to know about the six most important energy battles this election. RELATED Severe Storms Brewing For Election Day Threaten To Swing Tight Races Washington voters will decide whether or not to tax carbon dioxide emissions a policy championed by Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee and many Democrats and environmentalists who want to fight man made global warming. The ballot measure called Initiative 1631 would tax carbon dioxide emissions from industrial sources at 15 per ton in 2020 which would increase every year to reduce emissions. Supporters say the measure could raise more than 1 billion in revenue. Opponents however point out a carbon tax would raise the price of virtually every good while having no impact on future global warming. The tax would cost households and extra 175 per year in 2020 according to some estimates. The battle of Initiative 1631 has become the most expensive in state history so far drawing 45 million from both sides of the policy. Carbon tax opponents led by the oil and gas industry pumped 30 million into opposing the ballot measure and proponents have spent 15 million. An Octoberpoll found 50 percent of Washington voters favored the carbon tax while 36 percent opposed it. Colorado voters could end up banning hydraulic fracturing in most of the state. Polls show strong support for Proposition 112. The ballot measure if enacted would prohibit oil and gas drilling within 2500 feet of any building or vulnerable area including waterways and playgrounds. Thats more than double the current state buffer for oil and gas operations. A September poll put support for Proposition 112 at 60 percent but many prominent Democrats have come out against the measure. Democratic opponents include former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and former Gov. Bill Ritter. Supporters say the ballot measure would protect public health but opponents say its a red herring meant as a de facto ban on fracking. The measure would ban oil and gas drilling on more than 80 percent of non federal lands in the state experts said. California voters seem poised to repeal a gas tax hike signed into law only seven months ago that added an extra 12 cents per gallon and up to a 175 license fee for vehicle registration. A University of California Berkeley poll from October found nearly 58 percent of voters opposed the gas tax increase. The political battle heated up that month when gas tax opponents threatened to recall Attorney General Xavier Becerra a Democrat for allegedly trying to mislead voters about the proposal. Gas tax repeal proponents are also backing an initiative to halt spending on Californias high speed rail project and use any unspent funds to improve roads. Tom Steyer Is Behind Ballot Measures In Arizona and Nevada Liberal billionaire Tom Steyers campaign group NextGen Climate Action is backing ballot measures in Arizona and Nevada that would require both states to get 50 percent of their electricity from renewables like wind and solar. Steyer pumped more than 20 million into the campaign but opponents accused Steyers group of using forged and fake signaturesto get the green energy mandate on Arizonas ballot. Steyers group has spent more than 10 million in support of Nevadas green ballot measure. Pinnacle West the parent company of Arizonas largest utility spent more than 30 million opposing the green energy mandate according to Ballotpedia. Under current laws Arizona is required to get 15 percent of its electricity from renewables and Nevada utilities are required to get 25 percent of their power from green sources. Florida To Decide On Offshore Drilling And Vaping? Floridas Amendment 9 ballot measure if enacted would ban offshore oil and gas drilling in state waters and ban e cigarettes from being used in enclosed workplaces. The measure is backed by Democratic and environmental groups opposed to offshore drilling and apparently vaping indoors. Its opposed by Republicans the oil and gas industry and the Consumer Advocates for Smoke Free Alternatives Association a group that advocates for e cigarettes. Opponents have attacked the ballot measure for its odd pairing of issues smoking and offshore drilling. Many opponents of offshore drilling ended up opposing the measure because of its prohibition on vaping indoors. While our editorial board opposes offshore drilling in state waters we also are philosophically opposed to the Constitution Revision Commissions bundling of these unrelated issues into a single amendment the editorial board of Treasure Coast Newspapers wrote in October.

Donald Trump has singlehandedly been working to set back U.S. climate policy 50 years. Heoutraged the world by exiting the Paris climate agreement. He fired scientists from government advisory positions. He signed a bill to let coal mines dump waste into streams. He is trying to undo the Clean Power Plan fuel economy standards for carsoffshore drilling restrictions and solar tax credits. But at the state level politicians are fighting back and nowhere more so than in California. On Monday the California state legislature passed a sweeping deal to extend the states current cap and trade program until 2030. The law requires businesses to buy credits based on their volume of greenhouse pollution. The passage of this bill is a rare bipartisan victory. Democrats control both chambers of the California legislature but the bill required a supermajority. Republicans cast the deciding votes amid the endorsement of prominent California GOP politicians like former Gov. Pete Wilson. California has been at the forefront of the climate change fight ever since Trump was elected. Gov. Jerry Brown made news in December for telling Trump that if he scuttles climate research satellites California will launch its own damn satellites. More recently Brown helped found the United States Climate Alliance a group of state and local governments pledging to abide by the Paris climate agreement even after the federal government withdraws. So far 10 states including two with Republican governors have joined as well as several major cities. Even if Trump is willing to turn his back on our allies and our future to roll back the clock on environmental protection states like California are standing up and assuming the mantle of leadership.The fight for the environment is a fight for the secure future of human civilization and Trump cannot stop that fight.

The New York Times published an unreleased draft of the report Monday. The 543 page report was written by scientists from 13 federal agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.It concludes that temperatures in the U.S. have risen sharply by 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit over the last 150 years and that it is extremely likely that most of the global mean temperature increase since 1951 was caused by human influence on climate. Evidence for a changing climate abounds from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans the report states. Thousands of studies conducted by tens of thousands of scientists around the world have documented changes in surface atmospheric and oceanic temperatures melting glaciers disappearing snow cover shrinking sea ice rising sea level and an increase in atmospheric water vapor. Many lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities especially emissions of greenhouse heat trapping gases are primarily responsible for recent observed climate changes. The report completed this year and part of the National Climate Assessment has already been approved by theNational Academy of Sciences according to the Times. Its release hinges on the Trump administrations approval and one scientist who worked on the report told the Times that he and others feared the president would withhold it. Also the frequency of extreme weather events including heavy rain and heat waves has increased and is very likely to continue to do so. And since 1880 global sea levels have risen 8 to 9 inches roughly 3 of those inches since 1990 with human activity playing a substantial role according to the report. In a post to Twitter Gavin Schmidt a climate scientist and director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies said that nothing in the report is surprising for people working in the field but that it may be shocking to those that think climate change is just a future problem. The report delivers a strikingly different message than the one being pushed by Trump and his Cabinet members who continue to downplay the urgency of the threat as they work toward energy dominance. Since taking office Trump who famously called climate change bullshit and a Chinese hoax has moved quickly toderail Americas actions to combat climate change including rolling back President Barack ObamasClean Power Plan a policy limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Trump has pegged himself as a savior of Americas dying coal industry and has vowed to increase oil and gas production openingnow protected areasof the Arctic and Atlantic oceans to drilling. In June he announced plans topull the U.S. out of the historic Paris Agreement on climate change the international accord in which nearly 200 countries committed to slashing carbon emissions in an effort to prevent global temperatures fromincreasing 2 degrees Celsiusabove pre industrial levelsthe line scientists say the world must stay below to stave off the very worst effects of climate change. Meanwhile his Cabinet members have refused to say whether Trump believes climate change is real and continue to question how much the scientific community understands about the threat and the role humans play in observed changes. In MarchEnvironmental Protection AgencyheadScott Pruitttold CNBC No I would not agreethat carbon dioxide is a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. And in June Energy Secretary Rick Perry echoed Pruitts comments saying no when asked byCNBC whether he believes carbon dioxide is the primary control knob for the temperature of the Earth and for climate. Most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in Perry said.I mean the fact is this shouldnt be a debate about Is the climate changing? Is man having an effect on it? Yeah we are. The question should be you know just how much and what are the policy changes that we need to make to affect that? Also in June Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said glaciers in Montanas Glacier National Park started melting right after the end of the Ice Age and that it has been a consistent melt. He also dismissed the notion that government scientists can predict with certainty how much warming will occur by 2100 under a business as usual scenario.	False	False	False	True	False
WASHINGTON Reuters The Trump administration on Thursday proposed easing Obama era limits on oil and gas industry emissions of methane one of the main pollutants scientists link to climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency EPA said easing the 2016 regulation that targeted methane would save energy companies up to 123 million through 2025. The plan will undergo a period of public comment before being finalized and environmental groups pledged court action to try to block repeal of the limits. The proposal removes unnecessary and duplicative regulatory burdens from the oil and gas industry EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a release. The EPA said it will keep rules issued in 2012 that limit emissions known as volatile organic compounds that cause smog and also control some methane emissions. Some large energy companies including BP favor federal regulation of methane saying the regulatory certainty is preferable to a patchwork of varying rules by states and legal challenges by environmentalists. BP has said it is already taking steps to limit methane emissions. The move is the Trump administrations latest easing of rules designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions including many put forth by his predecessor President Barack Obama. President Donald Trump who insists he is an environmentalist has also relaxed rules on carbon emissions from vehicles and intends to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change. Concern about climate has heightened in recent weeks amid fires in the Arctic and the Amazon rainforest and melting of ice in Greenland. Democrats seeking their partys nomination in the 2020 U.S. presidential election will participate in a series of town halls on climate next week. In 2016 Obamas EPA issued the first rule limiting methane emissions from new oil and gas fracking operations including transport equipment. Thursdays proposal would repeal those regulations. The oil and gas business is the largest single source of methane emissions a major factor in global warming. The gas has more than 80 times the heat trapping potential of carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after it escapes into the atmosphere scientists say. Susan Dio chairman and president of BP America supported federal regulation of methane in an opinion piece in the Houston Chronicle earlier this year calling it the the best way to help further reduce and ultimately eliminate methane emissions industrywide. Environmentalists vowed to sue the administration over the proposal. We simply cannot protect our children and grandchildren from climate catastrophe if EPA lets this industry off scot free said David Doniger a climate and clean energy specialist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. If EPA moves forward with this reckless and sinister proposal we will see them in court.	True	True	True	False	False
The Environmental Protection Agencys 90 day suspension of new emission standards on oil and gas wells has been struck down by a US appeals court. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has long sought a repeal of the Obama era rules. A three judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 2 1 that the EPA would be allowed to reconsider a 2016 ruling that limited methane and smog forming pollutants emitted by oil and gas wells but could not delay the date it begins. Two judges concluded the administration record thus makes clear that industry groups had ample opportunity to comment on all four issues on which EPA granted reconsideration and indeed that in several instances the agency incorporated those comments directly into the final rule. READ MOREMining in Alaska may return as EPA scraps Obama era regulations Pruitt the new head of the EPA had been looking to extend a suspension on these activities for two years. There will be a separate administration public hearing on the same extension next Monday according to the Washington Post. The courts ruling is yet another reminder now in the context of environmental protection that the federal judiciary remains a significant obstacle to the presidents desire to order immediate change Richard Lazarus environmental law professor at Harvard Law School said in an email as reported by the Post. Lazarus continued the DC Circuits ruling today makes clear that neither the president nor his EPA administrator Scott Pruitt can by fiat unilaterally and instantaneously repeal or otherwise stay the effectiveness of the environmental protection rules put into place during the Obama administration. Former President Barack Obama had put in place a rule in 2016 that was connected to a regulatory strategy which sought to reduce methane emissions. At the time Pruitt was the Attorney General of Oklahoma and he and others sued the EPA to overturn the legislation. Pruitt has also begun to move on suspending or revoking many other measures which were implemented during the Obama years. This includes a two year delay on a certain regulations aimed at minimizing chemical accidents.	True	True	False	True	True
Included in the Bureau of Land Managements September oil and gas lease sale is about 47 square miles 122 square kilometers of land north of Hovenweep National Monument a group of prehistoric villages overlooking a canyon with connections to several indigenous tribes throughout the U.S. Southwest. The parcels for lease are about five to 20 miles eight to 32 kilometers north of the monument. The sale comes amid an ongoing debate over drilling in states like Colorado Arizona and New Mexico where a coalition of tribes are calling for a halt on energy development near land that Native Americans consider sacred. The Trump administration has pushed to open vast expanses of public lands to oil and gas drilling speed up the construction of petroleum pipelines and ease federal environmental regulations dismissing calls from scientists in and out of government that immediate cuts in oil gas and coal emissions are required to stave off the worst of climate change. When this oil and gas leasing happens on or near sacred lands it risks de stabilizing the bedrock of the structures said Ahjani Yepa a member of Utah Din Bikyah a Navajo grass roots organization. Hovenweep is in all of our stories and to threaten the integrity of these structures jeopardizes everything weve carried forward as resilient people. Hovenweep was designated as an International Dark Sky Park in 2014 by the International Dark Sky Association recognized for its striking night skies and star gazing opportunities. Southeast Utah is known for its sweeping desert landscapes and expansive night skies. The state has 11 internationally recognized Dark Sky Parks the most of any state. Business owners in Bluff said the dark skies drive tourism to Hovenweep and feared industrial light pollution as well as the sounds and smells of energy development could drive visitors away. As of Monday afternoon Finch said there were no results to share and the sale would continue until at least Tuesday. The agency says in planning documents that companies should take steps to protect the environmental and cultural landscape of the area including limiting the use of artificial light at drilling sites and protecting useable groundwater aquifers from drilling. Companies must obtain permits and go through environmental reviews before they begin construction or drilling. Some leases go years before drilling or expire before any activity occurs. Still environmentalists and Native Americans invested in the land said such documents fail to address a larger trend of leasing increasingly more land on or near sensitive tribal landscapes. Parcels near Hovenweep were offered then deferred in a March BLM lease sale and new documents for an upcoming December lease sale show more land will be up for grabs. At least we have our little foot in the door but thats as far as weve gotten she said. They argue these lands are abandoned but theyre not we use them in our prayers we visit them. You wouldnt like it if I went into your home your land and started digging. The Bureau of Land Management would benefit from more community outreach and long term planning to lease parcels on sensitive landscapes said Erika Pollard an associate director with the National Parks Conservation Association. But the new energy dominated era she said were in has made public input on these processes harder.	False	False	False	False	False
President Donald Trumps decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement has been portrayed in some press coverage as a decision driven by either his personal idiosyncrasies or the policy agenda of White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. And while theres an element of truth to that it misses the big picture. The reality is that this isnt just a story about Trump its a story about the Republican Party and the conservative movement which has adopted a rock solid widespread consensus in opposition to any serious action aimed at the US reducing carbon emissions. This has become a bedrock belief of the modern GOP. While we cant know if any other Republican president elected in 2016 would have for sure withdrawn from the Paris agreement many institutional actors within the GOP and the conservative movement from members of Congress including the Senate majority leader to think tanks to activist groups to media outlets to conservative donors including many with fossil fuel wealth strongly support this move and have in fact been urging Trump to make it. Furthermore even leading Republicans who might have supported sticking to the Paris deal it is after all non binding would have likely supported an agenda of weakening environmental regulations and taken little if any action aimed at reducing carbon emissions. The party simply does not believe climate change is a serious problem. The talking points differ Some deny humans are causing the planet to warm at all and say the very idea is a liberal hoax their number includes President Trump. More nuanced pundits and politicians acknowledge that the science is real but argue that even if it is accurate the consequences might not be so bad or that action would simply be too costly. But beyond a few notable exceptions the upshot is generally the same no matter where someone sits in the GOP that addressing climate change shouldnt be anywhere near the top of the presidents agenda. This is the consensus that the vast majority of the Republican Party from donors to politicians to intellectuals to voters has arrived at. Which makes it the crucial context for Trumps move Thursday. Though Trumps withdrawal from the Paris agreement has been received by some as a shocking move it was hardly a fringe position in the Republican Party he was being outright pressured to do it. But whether the US stayed in the Paris agreement or not it was crystal clear both before and after Thursdays announcement that the vast majority of the Republican Party supports an agenda of environmental deregulation and inaction on climate change. Take Trumps nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt. All along it was clear that Pruitt would be a rock solid opponent of federal regulatory efforts aimed at reducing carbon emissions. As Brad Plumer wrote last year during Pruitts tenure as Oklahoma attorney general he joined or led state lawsuits to block virtually every major federal regulation around climate and air pollution that Obamas EPA has put forward and professed to believe that the science around climate change was unsettled. Anyone even remotely concerned about climate change should naturally have opposed Pruitts nomination to head the USs top environmental regulatory agency and yet the sole Republican senator who voted against Pruitts confirmation was Susan Collins of Maine. The vast majority of the partys politicians simply do not think its a problem to appoint an EPA administrator who doesnt take the climate science consensus seriously. The same is true of the GOPs grassroots In a 2016 Pew survey only 23 percent of Republican voters said they believed Earth was getting warmer because of human activity. The occasional notable Republican politician who does conclude that the scientific consensus is accurate and tries to work with Democrats on the issue gets slammed by these passionate and well organized groups and can face serious pressure from the right as happened to Lindsey Graham when he was working on a cap and trade bill in 2010 and got attacked by Fox News. So its no surprise that most in the party decide not to stick their necks out lest they run afoul of the base and risk a primary challenge. Even Mitt Romney one of the few major Republicans who openly called on Trump to stay in the Paris agreement in recent weeks dodged and obfuscated on climate change when he was actually running for president and facing electoral pressures. We dont know whats causing climate change he said in October 2011. I'm not in this race to slow the rise of the oceans or to heal the planet he joked in August 2012. He only started acknowledging the seriousness of the issue in 2015 years after his loss. The reality is that one of the USs two major political parties is institutionally committed at nearly every level to the same basic agenda of environmental deregulation and inaction on carbon emissions. Trumps withdrawal in Paris isnt an odd outlier but instead rests on that foundation.	False	False	False	True	False
Scientists say that 2016 has been confirmed as the warmest year on record. Photo GettyEyeEm The evidence behind global climate change continues to mount and scientists keep speaking out. Now they hope the world will listen. The latest international climate report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA confirms that 2016 was the third consecutive year of record global heat. On Thursday afternoon the American Meteorological Society published the 27th annual State of the Climate report which verifies last year surpassed 2015 as the hottest since record keeping began in 1880. Based on preliminary data NASA and NOOA had made the same assessment back in January but this weeks report is considered definitive. Were scientists and were providing objective information Jessica Blunden a climate scientist at NOAAs National Climatic Data Center in Asheville N.C. told Yahoo News. We dont go into policy but we provide the information for people who want to go further with that. According to the report the effect of long term global warming and a powerful El Nio early on pushed 2016 into record setting warmth. The global average sea level reached a new record high last year as well to 3.25 inches above the average level in 1993 which marks the beginning of the satellite altimeter record. Scientists also said that the average Arctic land surface temperature continued to warm and global ice and snow cover continued to decline. Sea ice extents in the Antarctic hit record daily and monthly lows in August and November. The State of the Climate report is based on contributions from nearly 500 scientists from more than 60 countries using tens of thousands of measurements from several independent data sets. This summary of the global climate confirms data released on Jan. 18 based on analyses from scientists at NASAs Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. Blunden said the use of additional independent data sets distinguishes this report from what came before. The big difference in this report is we dont just look at NOAA data. There are about four different independent data sets we looked at to come to this conclusion Blunden told Yahoo News. Its not just NOAA who is agreeing with it. NASA the U.K. Met Office and the Japan Meteorological Agency are agreeing. Since the previous data was released mere days before President Trumps inauguration this peer reviewed report is the most thorough assessment of climate change officially released during the Trump era. Deke Arndt chief of the climate monitoring branch at NOAAs National Centers for Environmental Information described the report as diagnostic when asked if anyone from the White House had weighed in on itor questioned its findings. This report is a diagnostic report. It basically diagnoses what is happening in the climate system Arndt said on a conference call. Its intended to provide intelligence to those sort of decision makers that youre talking about. Concentrations of major greenhouse gases in the atmosphere also reached to new highs in 2016. For instance the global average concentration of carbon dioxide CO2 the primary driver of anthropogenic climate change in the atmosphere reached 402.9 parts per million ppm. This was the first time on record that CO2 concentration exceeded 400 ppm. The consensus of climate scientists is that the maximum safe level is 350.	True	False	False	True	False
A top Oregon Senate Democrat on Tuesday flinched in the face of a Republican walkout acknowledging that there are not enough votes to pass a major bill to address climate change. House Bill 2020 does not have the votes on the Senate floor said Senate President Peter Courtney Tuesday morning in an admission of defeat. That will not change. The central provision of House Bill 2020 is to institute a cap and trade mechanism for carbon dioxide across the state a mechanism to cut emissions 45 percent below 1990 levels by 2035 and 80 percent by 2050. Its a long thorough piece of legislation that mandates carbon emission reductions across the states economy while accounting for job quality standards and economic equity. And it would make Oregon the second state after New York with a legally binding economy wide greenhouse gas reduction target. Theres been incredible work going into that bill Courtney said. But according to Rick Osborn communications director for the Oregon Senate Majority office Democrats werent able to muster the votes for HB 2020 within their own caucus. Oregon Republicans argued that the bill would harm their rural constituents and energy intensive industries like cement production. They also said they were being bullied by Senate Democrats. And so 11 of them fled the state capitol on Thursday apparently to an undisclosed location in Idaho to deny quorum for a vote on the bill. Yet the walkout now appears to have been a highly politicized charade since Democrats may not have had the votes to begin with. My understanding is that it was known last week before the Republicans walked out Osborn told Vox. Courtneys admission is not rewarding Senate Republicans for bad behavior. Democratic Gov. Kate Brown nonetheless last week sent state police to find the lawmakers and instituted a 500 per day fine per person for each day they werent present at a legislative session. The Republicans are not standing against climate change theyre standing against democracy she said during a press conference Tuesday. Republicans had used the moment as an opportunity to appear defiant with one Republican state senator Brian Boquist even threatening police. Lawmakers closed down the capitol on Saturday after receiving credible threats from militia groups in favor of the Republican walkout. On Tuesday some of the Republicans in hiding were not sure what to make of Courtneys statement about the votes. And they werent committing to returning to work either according to Oregon Public Broadcastings Lauren Dake Even if Courtney wants to throw in the towel it may not be easy to kill the climate change bill to bring Republicans back to Salem as the Oregonian explained Although Courtney wields significant power in the Senate he cannot easily kill the climate bill in order to secure Republicans return. One possible first step could be for the Senate to vote to send the bill back to a committee but such a vote could not happen without a quorum meaning at least two Republicans would have to return to the Capitol. Another option that would also require a quorum could be a motion to postpone the bill indefinitely which under Senate rules would mean the bill could not be considered during this legislative session. If and when the bill dies it would be a painful defeat for Democrats who won legislative supermajorities in both chambers of the Oregon legislature in the last election. Oregon has also been working on carbon pricing policies since 1997. The concession from Democrats may have been motivated by a time constraint. The Oregon state legislative session ends on June 30 and more than 100 bills including funding for several state agencies are at risk of being scrapped. Democrats have conceded to Republican walkouts before yielding on major gun control and vaccine legislation. This latest surrender likely means that state Republicans despite being in the minority will continue to hold a veto over Democrats agenda.	True	True	False	True	False
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has ruled out accepting a G7 offer of aid to fight fires in the Amazon rainforest unless he gets an apology from his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron. Mr Bolsonaro said the French leader should apologise for insulting him personally by calling him a liar. Mr Macron had accused him of lying about fighting climate change. Aid worth 22m 18m was announced by Mr Macron at a summit in France of the seven leading industrial powers. Satellite data show a record number of fires burning in Brazil most of them in the Amazon region. Earlier Brazilian ministers said the G7 money was not needed and they accused foreign powers of wanting control of the Amazon. Last week Mr Macron said Mr Bolsonaro had lied to him at a G20 summit in Osaka Japan in June by failing to respect his climate commitments and by failing to pursue biodiversity. Mr Macron said France would not ratify a huge trade deal with South American nations unless Brazil did more to fight fires in the Amazon. On Tuesday Mr Bolsonaro told reporters in the capital Brasilia Mr Macron must withdraw the insults that he made to my person. Firstly he called me a liar. He also accused Mr Macron of questioning Brazilian sovereignty over the Amazon region Brazilian news website G1 reports. To talk or to accept anything from France whether it be with the best possible intentions he Mr Macron will have to withdraw those words and then we can talk he said. The two presidents hold sharply different political views with Mr Bolsonaro hailing from the far right in Brazil and Mr Macron elected in a run off against the far right in France. In another development Mr Bolsonaro responded to a joke on Facebook mocking the age of Mr Macron's wife Brigitte who at 65 is 25 years his senior. He wrote Do not humiliate the guy ha ha. Asked about Mr Bolsonaro's remarks Mr Macron said they were extraordinarily rude and sad. Adding to the row over the aid offer Mr Bolsonaro's chief of staff Onyx Lorenzoni mocked the fire that ravaged Notre Dame cathedral in Paris in April. Macron cannot even avoid a predictable fire in a church that is part of the world's heritage and he wants to give us lessons for our country? he said quoted by the Globo news website. As the largest rainforest in the world the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. It spans a number of countries but the majority of it falls within Brazil. Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil but satellite data published by Brazil's space agency show an increase of 80 this year. BBC analysis has also found that the record number of fires being recorded coincides with a sharp drop in fines being handed out for environmental violations. Mr Bolsonaro has previously said his government lacks the resources to fight the record number of fires in the Amazon region but his government is also being accused of slashing funding for environmental protection. The funding for Brazil's environment agency has gone down by 95 this year Yadvinder Malhi professor of Ecosystem Science at the University of Oxford told the BBC's Today programme. On Friday President Bolsonaro authorised the military to help tackle the blazes. Brazil says 44000 soldiers have been deployed to combat the fires and environmental crimes in the Amazon and military operations are under way in seven states as the result of requests for assistance from local governments. Jorgimar Alberto from Roraima one of the states most affected by the fires has seen the burning of most of the land surrounding his wooden house. It's a risky situation we have lots of crops here and everything is burning such as the cashew trees he told the BBC. I even had to keep the animals inside so that they don't burn as well. Every year it is the same these fires are disturbing the region a lot. Environmental officials helped him extinguish the fires last week only for them to reignite he said. His wife could not stand staying in the house with the smell of burning and the threat getting ever closer so she left. Lumberyard owner Edson Oliveira from southern Amazonas said he did not believe the media coverage about the Amazon. In my opinion the parts that are burning are the same that burn every year he told the BBC. Asked what he would like politicians to do for the Amazon he said that he would like economic alternatives for people here to find a way we can make use of the natural wealth we have here. It's no use pointing the finger at what's wrong without bringing alternatives to people he said. The 22m was announced on Monday as the leaders of the G7 Canada France Germany Italy Japan the UK and the US met in Biarritz France. Mr Macron said the funds would be made available immediately primarily to pay for more firefighting planes and that France would also offer concrete support with military in the region. Greenpeace France described the G7's response to the crisis as inadequate given the urgency and magnitude of this environmental disaster. As international concern over the fires spread Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio pledged 5m towards helping the rainforest. He has long maintained that European countries are trying to gain access to Brazil's natural resources. He alleges that European interest in the welfare of the Amazon is a thin guise for attempts to gain a foothold in the region. Asked by international journalists about environmental protection of the Amazon at a press briefing on 6 July he said Brazil is like a virgin that every pervert from the outside lusts for.

Reuters Rhode Island on Monday sued several major oil companies including Exxon Mobil Corp and BP plc accusing them of contributing to climate change that is damaging infrastructure and coastal communities in the state. The lawsuit announced by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Kilmartin was the first by a state seeking to hold oil companies responsible for costs associated with climate change and followed similar cases by several local governments nationally. The lawsuit alleged that various oil companies had created a public nuisance in the state and failed to adequately warn customers consumers and regulators about the risks posed by their products. For a very long time there has been this perception that Big Oil was too big to take on but here we are the smallest state taking on some of the biggest corporate polluters in the world Kilmartin said in a statement. The lawsuit filed in Providence County Superior Court named as defendants Exxon BP Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp among other companies. Shell in a statement said lawsuits that masquerade as climate action and impede the collaboration needed for meaningful change were not the answer to climate change. The other companies did not respond to requests for comment. The lawsuit by the Democratic attorney general follows similar cases by U.S. cities and local governments arguing the production of fossil fuels had led to rising tides that damaged shorelines roads and other properties requiring remediation. The lawsuit contended that the companies sought to refute scientific findings regarding how greenhouse gas pollution was causing climate change and failed to prevent the harm that would result from consumers using fossil fuel products. The lawsuit said that companies also violated the states Environmental Rights Act by polluting and destroying natural resources in Rhode Island. Kilmartin is seeking to force the companies to pay for damages associated with climate change citing the costs taxpayers were incurring to repair roads and bridges and rebuild coastal structures. The complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages as well as orders requiring the companies to pay abatement costs and to disgorge profits.	True	True	False	True	True
You all know that oftentimes the first folks that get flooded out are the poorest communities. Theyre often communities of color. Theyre the ones who can least afford to deal with the climate crisis he said during the CNN town hall. We know that this climate crisis is going to affect all Americans and all folks around the world but we also know that its going to hit some people particularly hard people that are the first people to get affected he said. Castro said that after he announced his campaign he first went to San Juan Puerto Rico to make sure that they could recover from Hurricane Maria. I think about poor communities along the east coast he said. Frankly I connect the dot to places like Flint Michigan and I know that too oftentimes its people who are poor communities of color who take the brunt of storms that are getting more frequent and powerful. He said his climate plan calls for new civil rights legislation to address environmental injustice including making sure people could file lawsuits against polluters. We need to invest in these communities and their ability to withstand storms and other natural disasters and their ability to have something as simple as clean water or breathe clean air he said. He said as former Housing and Urban Development secretary in the Obama administration he found out that 70 percent of HUD funded public or subsidized housing was within a mile of a superfund site. Thats the environmentalinjustice and racism that were dealing with and my plan would equip Americans with the tools tofight back and also make investments so that we can bring justice to what isright now a tremendous injustice he said. He said to pay for his plan he would create a carbon pollution fee on corporations who are industrial scale polluters.	True	True	False	True	False
The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to roll back more regulations on coal fired power plants Thursday. Its a striking move for two big reasons No new coal plants are being built in the US and the EPA itself along with 12 other federal agencies recently put out a sweeping report detailing the need to reduce emissions from fossil fuels because of the grave threat of climate change. Axios reported this week that on Thursday afternoon the agency will announce its intent to loosen Obama era restrictions on how much carbon dioxide new coal power plants can emit. Known as the New Source Performance Standards a provision under the Clean Air Act the rule established in 2015 said coal plants couldnt emit more than 1400 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour. This would have likely required new coal plants to install carbon capture technologies to limit some of their emissions. But the coal industry argued in court that these technologies are too expensive and immature to deploy at scale so the new standard is too difficult to meet. The lawsuit against the New Source Performance Standard was suspended once the EPA announced last year that it was looking to revise the rule. According to the New York Times the EPA wants to relax the limit to 1900 pounds of CO2 per MWh. These weaker standards come after an EPA proposal in August to replace another Obama regulation the Clean Power Plan which targets existing power plants. The replacement the Affordable Clean Energy rule would lead to 1400 additional premature deaths each year by 2030 according to EPAs own calculations. Weakening pollution rules for existing and new coal fired power plants is part of the Trump Administrations strategy to resurrect the decrepit US coal industry which has been shrinking and hemorrhaging jobs for decades. But its not regulations that are hurting the US coal industry its competition. Natural gas and renewables are increasingly cheaper than coal. With energy demand projected to stay level that means its coal thats going to yield. However the Trumps policies stand to slow the transition toward cleaner sources of energy at a time when scientists are warning that the world may have as little as 12 years to act to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius since the industrial revolution. Even as nations are gathering in Poland this week to discuss how to implement the Paris climate agreement the US delegation plans to host a panel touting the virtues of fossil fuels the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change. The rollbacks an international signal that were not taking carbon capture and sequestration and reducing impacts from coal seriously said Jay Duffy an associate attorney at the Clean Air Task Force. As weve pointed out over and over again the coal industry in the United States has been floundering for years and theres little Trump can do to stop it. In 2018 alone 20 coal fired power plants have closed or are scheduled to shut down. Overall coal power generation capacity has fallen by one third since 2010. And coal consumption is at its lowest level since 1979. Meanwhile coal mining jobs have cratered from a high of more than 800000 in the 1920s to roughly 76000 today. The EPAs latest proposal only affects new coal power plants. The last new coal plant to come online in the US was the 600 megawatt John W. Turk Jr. Power Plant in Arkansas back in 2012. Its actually one of the most high tech most efficient coal power plants in the country. But with a 1.8 billion price tag it was the most expensive project in Arkansas history. Duffy pointed out that the Turk plant emits about 1725 pounds of CO2 per megawatt hour so its already beating the EPAs proposed benchmarks. Its likely that with current technology any hypothetical new coal power plant would have to do almost nothing to cut its greenhouse gas emissions rendering the new regulation meaningless. Its nothing burger he said. Its a no standard standard. Yet coal plants are closing everywhere and no new ones are even on the drawing board. In fact environmental groups cant even sue to block the proposal at this point since there is no plant in the works that could potentially violate the Obama era greenhouse gas limits. No harm no foul. However environmental groups are ready to litigate if the proposal becomes finalized. Where this proposal could make a difference is in extending the lives of existing plants Duffy explained. Theres a quirk in EPA regulations that says that if you modify an existing coal plant enough it can be considered as a new plant. So in theory an aging power plant could get some upgrades that would extend its operating life but would also allow it to be held to the weaker greenhouse gas limit. Taken in tandem with all of the other Trump proposals to boost coal relaxed rules on stream protection coal ash and mercury as well as curbing incentives for clean energy it adds up to a prolonging of the steady demise of coal power in the United States. Correction An earlier version of this story said that environmental groups could not sue to block the EPAs latest New Source Performance Standard rule. Groups can sue once the proposal is finalized as a rule. However they cant sue while the rule is in the proposal stage and there are no power plants seeking to implement the proposal.

One of the reasons Im running for president is because America is running out of time he said on Tuesday framing the issue as a national security threat If were gonna get real about national security the time has come to treat climate disruption as the threat that it is. But Buttigieg hasnt yet released a climate plan on par with those proposed by some of his rivals including Washington Governor Jay Inslee who aims to mobilize9 trillion to combat the crisisand has based his entire presidential bid on the issue. SenatorElizabeth Warren former Texas RepresentativeBeto ORourke and evenJoe Biden the candidate to beataccording to most polls have proposed sweeping climate plans with trillions of dollars at play. Mayor Pete has released one climate related policy proposal so far aclimate corps similar to AmeriCorpsthat would put thousands of Americans to work on climate resilience and conservation endeavors. We do better when we have a project he said of his proposal at the Seattle event. But where does Buttigieg stand when it comes to implementing an economy wide plan? Buttigiegs answer to a question from the crowd shed light on what his climate plan could look like when or if he releases one. First A carbon tax and dividend. This is not about taking money out of the economy he said. I propose that we rebate that money right back out to the American people and we do it progressively. His pitch sounds like a revenue neutral carbon tax a fee on pollution that gets returned to taxpayers every year instead of going toward a climate resiliency fund or a green project. Well have to wait for his actual plan to figure out what he means when he says he wants to do it progressively. Its an idea that hasfailed at the ballot boxtwice in Washington state but a couple of other candidates including Inslee and Cory Booker have also championed some kind of carbon tax. Next massively increase the amount of federal RD that goes into not just renewable energy but also energy storage and carbon storage he said adding that this investment should be on par with the moon landing or the Manhattan Project. Every candidate with a climate plan so far has vowed to dedicate major resources to green research and development. Buttigieg said he wants toquadruple federal funding for RD. Then rejoin the Paris Agreementsomething thatall the Democrats running for president have said theyll doand host a stateside Pittsburgh Summit for mayors who are championing green policies and targets in their cities. A lot of the answers are coming from the communities he said. Finally Buttigieg emphasized the role rural America can play in mitigating the crisis. Every part of the American spectrum needs to be a part of the solution its not just cities he said. Buttigieg said earlier in the night that science sets the timeline for climate action not politics. But even if he took the White House in 2020 a carbon tax some more federal investment in RD a national service corps and yet another climate summit probably wont put the United States on the path to decarbonizationat the pace that science demands. At any rate it still doesnt have the same meat as the trillions promised and plans proposed by other candidates. Nevertheless some audience members were impressed by Buttigiegs vision of a green America. Nancy Lauterbach a 57 year old real estate agent said Buttigieg is savvy enough to put the RD that is needed into climate change. Ken Miller a 71 year old who owns a construction business liked the mayors authenticity. I thought his point that the timeline is set by science not by politics was compelling Miller said. As well as the fact that we as a country need a project and climate change is as good a one as well ever have.	True	True	True	True	True
WASHINGTON A Trump administration plan to provide older and disabled citizens greater access to national parks by expandingthe use of electric bikes is revving upcriticism from nature advocates who say the policy threatens to disturb pristine trails and poses a safety hazard. The National Park Service NPS announced the change Friday which would allow battery powered e bikes that can reach speeds of 28 miles per hour on the same park roads and trails that permit traditionalbicycles. The motor may not be used to propel an e bike without the rider also pedaling except in locations open to public motor vehicle traffic under the policy. They make bicycle travel easier and more efficient and they provide an option for people who want to ride a bicycle but might not otherwise do so because of physical fitness age disability or convenience especially at high altitudes or in hilly or strenuous terrain saidNational Park ServiceDeputy Director P. Daniel Smith. The change has drawn criticism by park advocates and some trail enthusiasts who say the administration did not do enough to seek public input on a policy that could damagethe park experience for many. E bikes have a place on national parks roads and motorized trails. But this announcement disregards well established policies for how visitors can enjoyably and safely experience the backcountry in national parks said Kristen Brengel senior vice president at the National Parks Conservation Association. For generations weve agreed that there are some places so special that they should be protected for visitors to enjoy away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Said Tyler Ray director of policy and advocacy for theAmerican Hiking Society Permitting e bike use on trails that have been thoughtfully and specifically designated as non motorized raises questions of safety and trail sustainability that must be considered. An e bike is classified asa two or three wheeled cycle with fully operable pedals and an electric motor of less than 750 watts 1 h.p. that provides propulsion assistance. Park Service officials notethe policy is modeled after a number of states that already allow expanded use of electric bikes. Mounting backlog Crumbling national parks Congress looks to hike funds for repairs after years of neglect In making the announcement the NPS touted the environmental effects of the new policy saying the e bikes can reduce greenhouse gas emissionswhen used as an alternative to cars and motorcycles and improve poor air quality at national parks by reducing traffic congestion. Park visitors posting in June before the policy was announced on the independent National Parks Traveler web siteexpressed mixed opinions on the expanded use of the electronic bikes. Someworriedthe low humming devices will add congestion noise and safety risks to normally quiet trails while others saidnational park trails should be more accessible to those who have physical handicaps. National monument Medgar Evers home would become national monument under lands bill sent to Trump Having an electric bike I would love the opportunity to enjoy nature trails specific to e bikes wrote Elizabeth Binnings who describes herselfas a disabled person with limited leg strength. Obviously not all trails are smooth enough but it would enhance my enjoyment of life to get out in nature and isn't that the point of National parks. There are plenty of places in most parks for those who are not 'physically able' to enjoy without getting on an e bike Alice Tharp posted on the blog.What's next? Elevators to Angels Landing at Zion National Park in Utah for those who can't hike it a tram ride at Yosemite National Park in California to get to the top of El Capitan?	False	True	False	False	False
Former Vice President Al Gore blasted the decision of President Donald Trump to remove the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement on Thursday calling it reckless and indefensible. Gore who has made two documentaries advocating climate change action said in a statement Removing the United States from the Paris Agreement is a reckless and indefensible action. It undermines Americas standing in the world and threatens to damage humanitys ability to solve the climate crisis in time. But make no mistake if President Trump wont lead the American people will. Civic leaders mayors governors CEOs investors and the majority of the business community will take up this challenge Gore said. We are in the middle of a clean energy revolution that no single person or group can stop. President Trumps decision is profoundly in conflict with what the majority of Americans want from our president but no matter what he does we will ensure that our inevitable transition to a clean energy economy continues. PARIS AGREEMENT ON CLIMATE CHANGE WASHINGTON REACTS TO US PULLOUT The Paris accord will undermine our economy Trump said during the announcement in the White House Rose Garden. Participating in the deal the president argued puts us at a permanent disadvantage. Its time to exit he said. The Paris Climate Agreement is a pact among nearly 200 nations made to voluntarily cut greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to combat climate change. Under the terms of the deal the U.S. the worlds second largest emitter of carbon would be required to reduce fossil fuel emissions around 30 percent by 2025. Gore and Trump previously met at Trump Tower in New York City in December. Gore called the conversation he had with Trump at the time extremely interesting.	False	False	False	True	True

Czarek SokolowskiAP hide caption toggle caption Czarek SokolowskiAP A coal fired power plant in central Poland. Global greenhouse gas emissions rose in 2018 and the world is on track for potentially catastrophic climate change in the coming decades. Czarek SokolowskiAP Leaders from nearly 200 countries are attending a special United Nations Summit on climate change today as they face increasing pressure from citizens around the world to cut global greenhouse gas emissions and slow global warming. Currently global emissions are on track to cause potentially catastrophic climate change in the coming decades. The summit acts as a kickoff to international climate negotiations in 2020 which is the next deadline for countries to make dramatic emissions reduction promises under the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. I am appealing for leadership from politicians from businesses and scientists and from the public everywhere U.N. Secretary General Antnio Guterres said when he announced the summit. We face a direct existential threat. Climate change is moving faster than we are. Indeed average temperatures on Earth continue to rise driving sea level rise more frequent and severe storms longer heat waves and cold snaps and more extreme rainstorms and droughts. Economic costs associated with such disasters are mounting. Although nearly every nation on the planet including the United States promised to reduce their net greenhouse gas emissions when they signed the Paris Agreement way20170601531048986 so what exactly is in the paris climate accord climate scientists warn that the cumulative pledges are nowhere near sufficient. Humans must limit global warming to about 1.5 degrees Celsius forecast from u n on global climate change above preindustrial temperatures in order to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. But right now if you take up all the pledges that governments have put forward for the Paris Agreement we're looking at about 3.5 degrees Celsius of warming by 2100 explains Angel Hsu nus.edu.sgaboutfacultyangel hsu an assistant professor of environmental studies at Yale NUS College in Singapore. We're way off Hsu says. What's really worrisome is that we need global emissions to peak by next year by 2020. That's really soon. China and the U.S. are the top greenhouse gas emitters in the world and their cooperation was the crucial foundation for the Paris Agreement. Delegations from both countries will attend today's U.N. summit but their positions have diverged. In the U.S. President Trump has threatened to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and his administration has moved to allow greater emissions from power plants vehicles and oil and gas operations. Despite local climate pledges by dozens of states and hundreds of cities the United States right now is not on track to meet its climate change commitments under the Paris Agreement says Kelly Levin levin a climate analyst at the World Resources Institute think tank. China on the other hand is on track to meet its commitments which hinged on reaching peak emissions no later than 2030. There have been some indications that they could peak their emissions by 2022 Hsu says. That's not so far away. That's about eight years ahead of schedule. And China is now a world leader chinas vision for climate action a new york times and conduit club london event in renewable energy including solar wind and hydropower. It's a glimmer of hope in a sea of otherwise dire news. Even as the government invests in clean technology China is building new coal fired power plants is china placing a global bet on coal outside its borders as part of its Belt and Road Initiative massive belt and road initiative. And even if the country's emissions start declining in the coming years it will likely be too slow to keep global temperatures in check. Nonetheless China is expected to be one of the countries to announce their intention to set more drastic emissions targets at today's summit. India is also expected to announce a plan to update its emissions promises. And some world leaders including the delegation from France are expected to announce that they intend to make drastic emissions cuts in the coming decade. 	True	False	False	True	True
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortezrecently suggested Miami would disappear ina few years due to climate change. The United Nations is convening a Climate Action Summit next week. And climate activist Greta Thunberg is on Capitol Hill this week telling lawmakers they must actsoon. But while data from NASA and other top research agencies confirms global temperatures are indeed rising a newly compiled retrospective indicates the doomsday rhetoric is perhaps more overheated. NYC SAYS 1.1M STUDENTS CAN ATTEND CLIMATE STRIKE PROTEST WITHOUT PUNISHMENT The conservative leaning Competitive Enterprise Institute has put together a lengthy compilation of apocalyptic predictions dating back decades that did not come to passtimed as Democratic presidential candidates and climate activistsrefocus attention on the issue. The dire predictions often repeated inthe media warned of a variety of impending disasters famine drought an ice age and even disappearing nations if the world failed to act on climate change. An Associated Press headline from 1989 read Rising seas could obliterate nations U.N. officials. The article detailed aU.N. environmental official warning that entire nations would be eliminated if the world failed to reverse warming by 2000. Then there were the fears that the world would experience a never ending cooling trend in the Northern Hemisphere. That claim came from an international team of specialists cited by The New York Times in 1978. Just years prior Time magazine echoed other media outlets in suggesting that another ice age was imminent. Telltale signs are everywhere from the unexpected persistence and thickness of pack ice in the waters around Iceland to the southward migration of a warmth loving creature like the armadillo from the Midwest the magazine warned in 1974. The Guardian similarly warned in 1974 that Space satellites show new Ice Age coming fast. In 1970 The Boston Globe ran the headline Scientist predicts a new ice age by 21st century. The Washington Post for its part published a Columbia University scientist's claim that the world could be as little as 50 or 60 years away from a disastrous new ice age. Some of the more dire predictions came from Paul Ehrlich a biologist who famously urged population control to mitigate the impacts of humans on the environment. Ehrlich in 1969warned that everybody would disappear in a cloud of blue steam in 20 years The New York Times reported. According to The Salt Lake Tribune Ehrlich warning of a disastrous famine urged placing sterilizing agents into staple foods and drinking water. ANDY PUZDER HERE'S WHY DEMS WANT TO GENERATE CLIMATE PANIC AS THEY IGNORE WAYS TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS Those predictions were made around the time former President Richard Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency. Since then the U.S. has adopted a series of environmental reforms aimedat limiting emissions. Years after those initial predictions media outlets and politicians continue to teem with claims of apocalyptic scenarios resulting from climate change. Earlier this month leading Democratic presidential candidates held a town hall on the issue and warned about the existential threat posed by a changing climate. Before the end of the month 2020 candidates are expected to have another climate forum at Georgetown University. CEI's report came just before the U.N. Climate Action Summit on Sept. 23an event that promises to spark the transformation that is urgently needed and propel action that will benefit everyone. It also came a week after Rep.Ocasio Cortez D N.Y. warned that Miami would be gone in a few years because of climate change. She was responding to critics of her ambitious Green New Deal which seeks to reach net zero emissions within just decades. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Ocasio Cortez whose plan has been endorsed by leading presidential candidates previously joked that the world would end in 12 years if it didn't address climate change. But short term predictions weren't a laughing matter in the years following An Inconvenient Truth a documentary produced by former Vice President Al Gore. In 2008 ABC released an ominous video about what the world would look like in 2015. As the video warned about rising sea levels a graphic showed significant portions of New York City engulfed by water.Gore himself famously predicted in the early 2000s that Arctic ice could be gone within seven years. At the end of seven years Arctic ice had undergone a period ofexpansion though recently it has been melting at a quicker pace.	True	False	False	True	True
Nearly four years later the White House is promoting the same brand of denialism and fealty to the fossil fuel industry at the United Nations climate conference in Poland. But in Washington the snowball metaphor might more accurately describe how a markedly different brand of climate politics is gaining support. By Wednesday the burgeoning effort to establish a select committee in the House of Representatives on a Green New Deal essentially a plan to make a plan picked up its strongest endorsements yet netting support from the co chairs of the 78 member Congressional Progressive Caucus and from the first labor union to back the proposal. At least 35 incoming or sitting House members support the resolution as do four senators. The proposal championed by Rep. elect Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D N.Y. came as grassroots groups like the Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats organized protests at the Capitol with young activists occupying Democratic leaders offices and urging lawmakers to pledge their support. Nearly 150 people were arrested Monday in the groups largest demonstration yet. The resolution faced skepticism from the top Democrats on natural resources and energy committees that wield legislative power over the issues a Green New Deal would cover. But proponents tweaked language in the proposal this week to mandate the select committee to lay out a vision for a Green New Deal while maintaining existing committees authority over the lawmaking process. I wouldnt even call it compromises. It was more specificities Pocan said. It was really getting at making it specific and workable. We wanted to make it so it could be an executable idea. The resolution calls for barring lawmakers who have accepted donations from the fossil fuel industry from serving on the select committee. Maintaining legislative power for existing committees with members who might have taken contributions from oil gas and coal donors could pose some risk but would be worth it said Rep.Pramila Jayapal D Wash. the other Progressive Caucus co chair. The harm thats done in taking legislative authority away from the committees is far too great she said. Everyone is ready. There are a lot of champions in the rooms that we need them to be in who will be controlling the agenda. The unusually speedy sausagemaking process inverts decades of Democrats dithering on the rapidly worsening crisis caused by greenhouse gas pollution. That mirrors the Trump administrations aggressive efforts to unwind the few relatively weak climate regulations that exist and to upend fragile negotiations at the 24th Conference of the Parties in Katowice Poland where diplomats this week are struggling to garner support for basic resolutions recognizing the scientific consensus on global warming. The summit follows an October report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that found that world governments must halve emissions over the next 12 years to avert warming of 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels beyond which climate change is forecast to be cataclysmic. The Trump administration announced plans to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord but that wont legally go into effect until 2020. In the meantime the administration has worked hard to further undercut the talks. The United States teamed up with Russia Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to weaken a resolution to endorse the report something the State Department outright refused to do. The Democratic Party needs an answer for what their plan is to match the U.N.s recommendations in the IPCC report on climate said Waleed Shahid the communications director for Justice Democrats a left wing group that played a leading role in Ocasio Cortezs winning primary campaign. Young people and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez are providing a solution to that dilemma. Thats not the only issue for which the Green New Deal would provide a fix. The Democratic Party has long been dogged by tensions between environmentalists clamoring for action on climate change and labor leaders warning against policies that ostracize the fossil fuel industry which provides high paid construction jobs. In August the Democratic National Committee under pressure from unions backtracked on a two month old resolution to ban donations from oil gas and coal companies.	True	False	False	True	False
This weekend close to 200 million Americans will face temperatures of 90F 32C and higher. Add in humidity and many cities across the East Coast and Midwest will be feeling more like 110F 43C. Heat waves have killed more people on average than any other extreme weather event in the US according to the Centers for Disease Control CDC. Officials define extreme heat as a period of two to three days of high heat and humidity with temperatures above 90F 32C. On the heels of earth's hottest June on record the US National Weather Service NWS estimates over 100 record high minimum temperatures could be set as the heat lingers even past sunset. Here's what that sort of heat can do. Air conditioning is used in 87 of US homes according to a 2018 report by the US Energy Information Administration EIA. During heat waves air conditioning use stresses power grids and can lead to city wide outages. In cities that means millions of units including those on cars and buses and trains constantly pushing out heat into the atmosphere. Studies have found the extra heat from air conditioning can raise temperatures by as much as 2C. And when it gets hotter our thermostats turn lower and the cycle continues. But it goes further than just an ever hotter summer season the emissions from air conditioners and their refrigerants is contributing to climate change. The man made greenhouse gases used in air conditoners called hydrofluorocarbons HFCs are thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In cities the cycle is also exacerbated by all the concrete asphalt steel and glass creating an urban heat island. When temperatures get too high planes get grounded. Extreme heat reduces air density and the amount of lift a plane can get to take off. Temperatures of 120F 49C saw dozens of flights cancelled in Phoenix during a 2017 heatwave. Smaller planes are affected first but larger Boeing or Airbus jets have maximum operating temperatures around 126F 52C AZ Central reported. In a heat wave concrete and asphalt don't fare well. Asphalt warps and melts. Concrete if water is involved can sometimes explode or break open. This week local media in Kansas has reported several instances of cracked and buckled roads as temperatures rise. In Iowa one city mayor said old concrete roads soaked with floodwaters from this spring are now exploding and damaging sewer lines. The NWS outpost in Omaha Nebraska demonstrated just how hot vehicles can get in heat waves by cooking American biscuits on a dash. The temperatures reached a high of 185F 85C not quite enough for a proper bake but certainly too hot for humans or animals to survive in. According to the National Weather Service 21 young children have died in hot cars this year. Unsurprisingly as everything warms up in a heat wave anything metal gets even hotter. When it comes to power lines this can cause dangerously low sagging. If lines droop low enough to touch the ground or trees they can short out. Kinks can form on train rails when the metal expands. In 2012 a heat kink caused a 32 car long freight train to derail and fly off an overpass a similar derailment happened in 2017. Experts told Fox 26 News more than 2100 trains have been derailed in the last 40 years because of these heat warps. Metal components in draw bridges can expand and become inoperable last year Chicago firefighters had to hose down a downtown draw bridge so it could be used. Crops can also feel the heat. Farmers across the Midwest are warning that vegetables can wilt in the heat and farms will lose productivity worsening the situation after a historic flooding season this spring. Soybean farmers also say the dry conditions could cause an increase in spider mites and other plant diseases. Extreme heat makes pollution worse which can be dangerous for the very young the elderly and anyone with respiratory diseases. In the nation's capital where the mayor has declared a heat emergency officials warned that air quality would reach unhealthy levels for these sensitive groups over the weekend.

President Donald Trump has been a climate change denier for years alleging that global warming is a Chinese invention and declaring that cold winter days prove that it's a hoax. Perhaps not surprisingly his staff seems to share these views. According to Politico Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland recently tried to get Trump riled up about climate change with a bit of fake news. McFarland reportedly slipped Trump two Time magazine cover stories. One was supposedly from the 1970s and warned about a coming ice age. The other from 2007 discussed how to survive global warming. But there was one glaring problem The 1970s cover was a hoax. In 2007 Time published a cover story titled The Global Warming Survival Guide. Sometime after that internet hoaxers doctored the cover to instead say How to Survive the Coming Ice Age and alleged that it was a 1977 cover. The hoax spread quickly and climate deniers used it to argue that in the 1970s scientists were actually worried about global coolingand since it didn't happen then the public shouldn't believe warnings about global warming now. The hoax seems to have had its intended effect on Trump who according to Politico quickly got lathered up about the media's hypocrisy. A White House official defended McFarland in an interview with Politico calling the Time hoax fake but accurate. The White House didn't respond to a request for comment from Mother Jones. While the Time global cooling cover story never existed it's certainly true that some media outlets including Time ran stories in the 70s warning about global cooling. One published by Newsweek is a favorite of climate deniers. Scientific American explained Newsweek's global cooling story in 2014 But global cooling was never a popular theory among scientists. Even as some news outlets were writing about it notes Scientific American a counter theory about a warming planet was already on the rise. In fact a survey of peer reviewed scientific papers from 1969 to 1975 shows that the majority of scientists predicted that carbon dioxide levels would rise causing temperatures to rise as well. Scientists have since reached an overwhelming consensus The planet is getting warmer and humans are to blame. But this hasn't stopped climate deniers from citing the old stories as evidence that contemporary news reports about climate change shouldn't be believed.

European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker said President Trump doesnt seem to understand that he cant immediately yank the United States out of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Thats not how it works. The Americans cant just leave the climate protection agreement Juncker said Wednesday according to a translation from NBC News. Mr. Trump believes that because he doesnt get close enough to the dossiers to fully understand them. Reports circulated Wednesday that Trump had decided to withdraw from the international pact which has been signed by every country in the world except Nicaragua and Syria but as of late afternoon there was no formal announcement. Juncker the former prime minister of Luxembourg has been leading the European Commission the civil service of the European Unions executive branch in Brussels since November 2014. During a student conference on Europes future he explained that the United States would have to wait three to four years after the agreement took effect in November 2016 before leaving. Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk represented the European Union at last weeks Group of Seven G7 summit in Taormina a small town in Sicily. They met with leaders from the seven democracies with the worlds most developed economies Canada France Germany Italy Japan the United Kingdom and the United States. Amid talk of combating terrorism and the global economy they also discussed international efforts to fight climate change. These conversations come at a particularly fraught time because Trump who does not share his predecessor Barack Obamas commitment to clean energy has been reviewing the United States environmental policies. According to a translation from NBC News Juncker said that they attempted to explain to Trump that he could not simply pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement because the treaty contains safeguards to prevent exactly that. So this notion I am Trump I am American America first and Im going to get out of it that wont happen he continued. We tried to explain that to Mr. Trump in Taormina in clear German sentences. It seems our attempt failed. He said that the law is the law and it must be obeyed regardless of what Trump thinks adding somewhat sardonically that not everything in international agreements is fake news. On Wednesday morning Axios published a report citing two sources with direct knowledge of the decision that Trump was planning to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. Shortly after the news spread Trump tweeted that he would be announcing his decision regarding the international agreement within the next few days. Later Wednesday during a meeting with Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc of Vietnam at the White House Trump dodged a question about whether he still thinks that climate change is a hoax. When asked if he was leaning in a direction concerning Paris Trump simply said Im hearing from a lot of people both ways. Many scientific organizations have released statements or reports affirming that anthropogenic climate change is real and that it could have devastating effects if actions are not taken to limit carbon dioxide emissions. The American Meteorological Society released a statement that read in part It is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half century is human induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide CO chlorofluorocarbons methane and nitrous oxide. Dan Bodansky a law professor at Arizona State University and a leading climate change expert explained that Trump could get the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement two different ways withdrawing from the Paris Agreement itself or leaving the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC. The text of Paris Agreement allows for countries to provide a years notice of its intent to withdraw. But this notice cannot be submitted until three years after the agreement entered into force for that country which happened in November 2016. Whether the U.S. decides to pull out or not under international law and the Paris Agreement the withdrawal would not be effective until 2020 Bodansky told Yahoo News. Another option which would get the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement in just one year would be to leave UNFCCC which was an agreement brokered under former President George H.W. Bush in the early 90s. Although this would be faster it would carry even more serious consequences. Bodansky said that leaving the UNFCCC would automatically get the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement as well. If we pulled out of both then we wouldnt be a party at all. We wouldnt participate in meetings and wed just be there as an observer he said. Both of them would be viewed very negatively by other countries by allies in Europe and elsewhere but pulling out of the Framework Convention would be an even more drastic step.

While speaking in Kentucky at an event with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Pruitt said he will sign the proposed rule repealing Obama's plan Tuesday. When you think about what that rule meant it was about picking winners and losers. Regulatory power should not be used by any regulatory body to pick winners and losers he said at the event. The past administration was using every bit of power and authority to use the EPA to pick winners and losers and how we generate electricity in this country. That's wrong. Under the interpretation proposed in this notice the CPP exceeds the EPA's statutory authority and would be repealed the proposal reads. The EPA welcomes comment on the legal interpretation addressed in this proposed rulemaking. The proposal also says the EPA has yet to determine whether it will create an additional rule on the regulation of greenhouse gases. first reported on the repeal proposal. first reported on the repeal proposal. Bloomberg News first reported on the repeal proposal. The Clean Power Plan requires states to meet specific carbon emission reduction standards based on their individual energy consumption. The plan also includes an incentive program for states to get a head start on meeting standards on early deployment of renewable energy and low income energy efficiency. Under President Barack Obama the EPA estimated the Clean Power Plan could prevent 2700 to 6600 premature deaths and 140000 to 150000 asthma attacks in children. When asked earlier this year on Fox News about the health consequences of doing away with the Clean Power Plan Pruitt ducked the question and focused on how the plan would cost jobs. He argued the plan was bureaucratic overreach. As much as we want to see progress made with clean air and clean water with an understanding that we can also grow jobs we have to do so within the framework of what Congress has passed Pruitt said. Former EPA employees have reacted harshly to the planned repeal of the rule. Obama's EPA administrator Gina McCarthy called the proposal just plain backwards. A proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan without any time line or even a commitment to propose a rule to reduce carbon pollution isn't a step forward it's a wholesale retreat from EPA's legal scientific and moral obligation to address the threats of climate change McCarthy said in a statement Friday. Environmental advocacy groups quickly blasted Pruitt's decision with many vowing to fight the measure in court. Now the public has an opportunity to weigh in as EPA is required to accept public comment on the proposed repeal and a discussion paper on a replacement Rhea Suh president of the Natural Resources Defense Council said in a statement Monday. In addition NRDC expects to take EPA to court when the Clean Power Plan repeal is made final. When reports of the EPA's planned move began to be reported over the weekend Environmental Defense Fund President Fred Krupp said repealing the plan without replacing it with any protections from climate destabilizing pollution would fail to protect Americans from harmful pollution designated under the Clean Air Act. And Michael Brune executive director of the Sierra Club said Trump and Pruitt are launching one of the most egregious attacks on public health and climate safety. No matter who is in the White House the EPA is legally required to limit dangerous carbon pollution and the Clean Power Plan is an achievable affordable way to do that Brune said in a Monday news release. It is a key element in continuing the progress moving toward clean energy and retiring coal. Former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg whose philanthropy said it would donate 15 million toward supporting operations of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change after the Trump administration announced intentions to withdraw from the Paris climate accord tweeted his criticism of the repeal proposal Monday. The EPA can repeal the Clean Power Plan but not the laws of economics Bloomberg tweeted. This won't revive coal or stop the US from reaching our Paris goal.	True	False	False	True	False
An extensive report from the Environmental Protection Agency found that including ethanol into the U.S. gas supply is wreaking havoc on the atmosphere and soil. In a study titled Biofuels and the Environment The Second Triennial Report to Congress the Environmental Protection Agency EPA determined thatethanol derived from corn and soybeans is causing serious harm to the environment.Water soil and air quality were all found to be adversely affected by biofuel mandates. Evidence since enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act suggests an increase in acreage planted with soybeans and corn with strong indications from observed changes in land use that some of this increase is a consequence of increased biofuel production read a portion of the 159 page report. The ethanol mandate has negatively effected water quality with greater biofuel production resulting in more harmful algae blooms and hypoxia. While most algae is harmless to water some forms such as the kind produced in Lake Eerie from biofuel feedstock has emitted toxic chemicals into the water. This harmful algae can consume the oxygen in the water a process known as hypoxia killing other wildlife. Increased irrigation fueled by growing demand for ethanol has also taken a toll on the ground with the report finding grassland to annual crop conversion negatively impacts soil quality because it increases erosion and the loss of soil nutrients. Essentially the study found that biofuel mandates are boosting production of corn and soybeans. Large scale production of these crops is causing environmental degradation.The EPA also found that at least in some instances using ethanol in lieu of gasoline resulted in worse air emissions. Air quality modeling suggests that production and use of ethanol as fuel to displace gasoline is likely to increase such air pollutants as PM2.5 ozone and SOx in some locations read a section of the report pertaining to air quality. While traditional gasoline contains more CO2 ethanol based fuels have more nitrogen oxides NOx which can be more harmful to human health. NOx can exacerbate asthma by causing inflammation of the respiratory airwaves with long term exposure resulting in decreased lung function The mandate in reference concerns the Renewable Fuel Standard RFS a 2005 law that requires oil refineries include a certain amount of ethanol in their fuel mix. The law was passed with the intention of aiding in climate change efforts. The RFS has proven to be controversial with oil producers deriding the mandate as costly and unneeded. Corn growers however support the mandate as it drives demand for the product. RELATED New EPA Chief Will Continue Scott Pruitts War With The Corn Lobby During his time leading the EPA Scott Pruitt became an adversary of ethanol proponents after granting more RFS waivers and pushing for a rollback of the law altogether. Its not immediately clear how the Trump administration will handle the RFS debate moving forward. Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler has suggested he will continue seeking changes to the mandate but President Donald Trump told an Iowa crowd in July that the EPA may soon allow for more ethanol to be included in gas. The EPA study published on June 29 came after a long delay. Federal law calls for the EPA to conduct a study on the Renewable Fuel Standard every three years but the government was four years late this go around. The agencys previous ethanol study was published in 2011.

Scott Pruitt who on Thursday resigned as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency was a firm favourite of Donald Trump. But Pruitt was plagued by scandal and faltered in carrying out the presidents agenda of peeling back clean air and water regulations. His replacement is likely to be far more adept. While Pruitt was a bte noire to environmentalists for his zeal in targeting Obama era rules and his dismissal of climate science his attempts at deregulation were regularly framed as rushed and clumsy as they floundered in the courts. Andrew Wheeler Pruitts replacement at least in the interim could be a more effective weapon for Trump. A consummate Washington insider and a former coal lobbyist he will likely approach his work with the same ideology as Pruitt but without the flamboyance and ethical scandals a far more dangerous prospect for those aghast at the Trump administrations attitude to the environment. Pruitts agenda was really Trumps agenda and I think Andrew is as fully committed to advancing it as Pruitt was Myron Ebell who led the EPA transition team for Trump and has known Wheeler for two decades told the Guardian. He knows much more about managing the agency and the technical side of the environmental statutes that EPA is charged with enforcing than Pruitt. Undoing Barack Obamas regulatory onslaught at EPA is a key part of the presidents economic revival agenda and therefore Wheeler will be a point man for Trump just as Pruitt was. For opponents of the president the prospect is a daunting one. Scott Pruitt was the most scandal plagued cabinet member in an administration rife with corruption said Christy Goldfuss an environment advisor to Obama who is now at the Center for American Progress. There is no reason to believe that Wheeler will fix the problems left behind and put childrens health ahead of his industry friends. Confirmed by the Senate as deputy EPA administrator in April Wheeler is well versed in the machinations of the federal government. He spent four years at the EPAs office of pollution prevention in the Bush and Clinton administrators before working for Senator James Inhofe an Oklahoma Republican whose vocal rejection of climate change science involved theatrics such as bringing a snowball on to the Senate floor. Wheeler then became a lobbyist at Faegre Baker Daniels where he represented Murray Energy a major coal company until August 2017. The firm put to Trump a wish list of environmental rollbacks Wheeler helped in its attempts to fight limits on toxic emissions such as mercury. While working for Marco Rubios presidential campaign in February 2016 Wheeler wrote a now deleted Facebook post in which he called Trump a PR person and a bully which he said should alone should disqualify him from the White House. That has not hindered his rise in the Trump administration. Shortly after his nomination in October Wheeler sent an email to Ryan Jackson Pruitts chief of staff with a link to an article by the satirical website the Onion that was headlined EPA Promotes Pulsating Black Sludge to Deputy Director. Welcome pulsating black sludge Jackson responded in emails released under freedom of information laws. I guess Im going to have to get the cleaning crews to come in more often. Wheeler insisted he didnt want Pruitts job. I could have put my hat in the ring for the administrator he said in June. I wasnt interested in that. I am still not interested in that. Now that he is in the role he said he didnt covet he will be tasked with completing the job of dismantling environmental and climate regulations. Pruitt went about it enthusiastically but ran into legal action launched by states such as New York and California as well as environmental groups. Pruitts attempt to halt restrictions on emissions of methane a powerful greenhouse gas was stymied by the courts as were proposed delays to stricter limits of lead in paint and hazy ozone in urban areas. Trumps EPA has also had difficulty in coming up with robust reasons why fuel efficiency rules for cars should be watered down or what will replace the clean power plan given that the agency is legally obliged to force down greenhouse gas emissions. Wheeler with his knowledge of the rule making process will help manage such reversals while avoiding headlines over 1500 fountain pens Trump Hotel mattresses or Chick fil A franchises. He is low key and likes to keep a low profile Ebell said. He may have to do more public speaking than he wants to. A senior EPA official who did not wish to be named said I think it will be night and day with Wheeler or at least night and late afternoon. He will talk to us. Hes a human being not a politician. Wheeler is likely to maintain Pruitts close ties to industry however. Under Trump the fossil fuel industry has wielded unusual influence over the agency that supposedly regulates it and beleaguered staff fret that its public health mission is at risk of being buried. Pruitts removal is just the first step in restoring a strong EPA that gets back to its mission to protect public health and our environment said Carol Browner a long serving EPA chief in Bill Clintons administration. Congress must ensure the next EPA administrator is not another industry insider.	True	False	False	True	True
Warren promised in a tweet Friday to sign an executive order that puts a total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases for drilling offshore and on public lands and vowed to ban fracking everywhere Warrens pledge to ban fracking follows Sen. Bernie Sanders I VT call urging fellow Democrat candidates to support a fracking ban on public and private lands. Fracking is a danger to our water supply. Its a danger to the air we breathe. It causes earthquakes. Its highly explosive. Safe fracking is like clean coal pure fiction Sanders said in a statement Wednesday. But most importantly methane from natural gas contributes to climate change and is setting us on a path to disaster he added. When we are in the White House we will end the era of fossil fuels and that includes fracking Ten Democrat candidates participated in CNNs seven hour climate change town hall Wednesday and manysignaled support for the implementation of a carbon tax as well as plastic straw bans actions on meat consumption and the end of fracking. Theres no question Im in favor of banning fracking Sen. Kamala Harris D CA said during the town hall. Starting with what we can do on day one around public lands and then there has to be legislation but yes. This is something Ive taken on in California I have a history of working on this issue she added. Sen. Cory Booker D NJ said he would ban fracking right away on public lands. Warren released her comprehensive climate change proposal inspired by Gov. Jay Inslee D ahead of CNNs town hall. It called for the decarbonization of the economy and100 percent clean energy over the next decade. While Warren did not go as far as Sanders in calling for the complete public ownership of utilities she said she will tell companies that use carbon based fuel that they are done by 2035. Im perfectly willing to take on giant corporations. I think Ive been known to do that once or twice. But for me I think the way we get there is we just say sorry guys but by 2035 youre done she said during CNNs town hall.	True	False	False	True	True
Hurricane Michael roared through the Florida Panhandle last week with 155 mph winds and a storm surge that reached 14 feet killing at least 18 people in four states destroying homes and knocking down power lines serving millions of customers. Tyndall Air Force Base near Panama City Florida took a direct hit and suffered heavy damage. The flight line is devastated. Every building has severe damage. Many buildings are a complete loss according to the bases most recent storm damage update. Of particular concern were the bases F 22 Raptor aircraft the most sophisticated fighter jet in the Air Forces arsenal. The stealth fighters cost 377 million apiece if you include research and development costs and the Air Force has 183 of them in its inventory. Tyndall is home to 55 of those F 22s. The New York Times reported that 33 of the Raptors were sent to Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio leaving several of the highly valuable aircraft in the path of the storm. A spokesperson for the Air Force declined to give any tallies for damaged aircraft at Tyndall saying that crews are still assessing the scale of the damage. However photos taken by passers by show several F 22s in damaged hangars. We dont yet know the full extent of the damage across Tyndall or to the F 22s in particular. Reports now indicate that most of the F 22 aircraft that remained at Tyndall survived the storm intact and with repairable damage. But the fact that expensive hardware was housed in exposed structures on the Gulf Coast illustrates how vulnerable the military is to extreme weather especially as storms like hurricanes gain a boost from climate change. It also shows that the military is on the front lines of the consequences of rising temperatures. Conflicts exacerbated by drought heat and storms are a major concern for defense planners. Military installations themselves are also at risk At least 128 bases face inundation from sea level rise. With billions of dollars of assets in harms way and more weather extremes on the horizon making and enacting disaster plans are becoming all the more critical for the military. While Hurricane Michael was the first Category 4 storm to make landfall in the Florida Panhandle on record major hurricanes have struck the region in the past. Tyndall Air Force Base spans more than 29000 acres and is home to almost 4000 active military personnel. Officials say that base staff and their families were evacuated ahead of the storm and since Michael passed no fatalities or injuries were reported. But the bases runways sit adjacent to barrier islands including the aptly named Hurricane Island and were particularly at risk for damage from extreme weather. A hangar on the base even served as a refuge for other Raptors in May as Subtropical Storm Alberto hit the region. Tyler Rogoway at The Drive wrote a compelling explanation for why all the valuable aircraft werent simply flown out of harms way At modern fighter is not a Honda Accord. You dont just hop in it and drive it around for months until you finally have to take it for a one hour oil change when the light comes on. If anything they are far more akin to high end sports cars that require a lot of expensive TLC to keep operating. The F 22 in particular is more analogous to an exotic supercar or even a high end race car than anything else. It requires dozens of hours of maintenance for every single flight hour and deep maintenance can take days or even many weeks to accomplish depending on what is needed to be done and availability of spare parts which can be scarce. The aircraft that werent removed were likely undergoing maintenance and couldnt be readied in time for transportation especially given that Hurricane Michael gained strength so fast. However given that there are so few F 22s overall the Air Force has more than 400 F 15s and more than 1000 F 16s and that Raptors are no longer being manufactured each lost or damaged F 22 presents a large loss of capability. The coastal bases that house sensitive equipment like F 22s also face hazards particularly from extreme weather. As climate change pushes average temperatures up the raw ingredients of hurricanes water temperature and air temperature also intensify. Water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico were 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit higher than is typical this time of year. Michaels rapid ramp up also comports with what scientists expect from global warming. As the climate continues to warm hurricanes may intensify more rapidly just before striking land making hurricane forecasting more difficult wrote Massachusetts Institute of Technology climate scientist Kerry Emanuel in a 2017 paper in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. For its part the military has been blunt about the risks posed by climate change describing it as a threat multiplier. The effects of a changing climate will impact our security situation said Defense Secretary James Mattis during his confirmation hearing. The military assembled an adaptation roadmap in 2014 chalking out how they plan to contend with climate change. Plans include raising coastal infrastructure protecting vulnerable supply chains and increasing disaster training. And the head of the National Guard Air Force Gen. Joseph Lengyel told Voxs Alex Ward last week Theres a lot of storms coming our way. Whatever the reason we have to be ready to deal with them. However Lengyel waffled on humanitys role in shaping the climate behind these storms. I believe the climate is changing. I dont know why he said. However as Hurricane Michael showed theres a vast gulf between acknowledging climate change and adequately preparing for it. Either there was a plan in place to deal with an unprecedented storm at Tyndall and it wasnt followed or there wasnt one and were already seeing the consequences.	False	True	False	True	False
GRETA Thunberg has been snubbed for the Nobel Peace Prize which has instead been awarded to Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed for ending the 20 year Eritrea conflict. Bookies had suggested the teen climate campaigner was the front runner for the illustrious honour after she launched a furious tirade at the United Nations. But the Nobel Institute gave the award to the Ethiopian leader for ending one of Africa's longest running conflicts. Within months of coming to office in 2018 the 43 year old signed a Joint Declaration of Peace and Friendship with Eritrean Prime Minister Isaias Afwerki. He was also praised for his domestic reforms including releasing tens of thousands of political prisoners and allowed previously banned opposition groups. The prize is 730000 and will be formally awarded in Oslo in December. Greta first came to prominence after launching a school strike that has inspired millions of kids to take Fridays off to protest about climate change. The 16 year old Swede started the Fridays for Future movement to demand action be taken to combat global warming and is currently taking a year off school to focus on campaigning. Greta started the strike alone outside the Swedish parliament in Stockholm last August and has gone on to become one of the most recognisable faces in world affairs. The enmity between the two countries that occupy the Horn of Africa came after a border war fought between 1998 and 2000. The two countries disputed their border in the scrubby and desolate plains of Badime. Around 80000 soldiers and civilians died in the war which drained the resources of the two countries. The total cost to Ethiopia of the war and was believed to be around 3 billion while Eritrea was force to conscript 300000 soldiers a tenth of its population. After the fighting ended a stalemate remained as international mediation efforts were made to resolve their dispute. After Abiy took office he offered an olive branch to the Eritreans. Within weeks Eritrea's longtime leader visibly moved visited Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa and communications and transport links were restored. For the first time in two decades people could long divided families made tearful reunions. The improving relations led to the lifting of United Nations sanctions on Eritrea one of the world's most reclusive nations. She already has an honour to her name after winning Amnesty International's highest Ambassadors of Conscience human rights award last month. Climate change is an issue which is strongly related to security and peace. In her UN speech Greta blasted governments for thinking only of money as she said the world was sleepwalking into a climate catastrophe. She raged People are suffering people are dying entire ecosystems are collapsing we are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and the fairy tale of endless economic growth. How dare you! The teens fiery speech was hailed by millions with climate change activists taking to the streets in huge protests around the world. But head activism has led to criticism from from world leaders and others who allege she is being manipulated. Vladimir Putin took aim at the teenager branding her poorly informed and saying she was telling developing countries they should keep living in poverty. The Russian president claimed its hypocritical to lecture poorer countries on the environmental impact of their bids to become more developed like the West. No one has explained to Greta that the modern world is complex and different and ... people in Africa or in many Asian countries want to live at the same wealth level as in Sweden. Go and explain to developing countries why they should continue living in poverty and not be like Sweden. Putin said young people who paid attention to environmental issues should be supported. Im sure that Greta is a kind and very sincere girl he said. But adults must do everything not to bring teenagers and children into some extreme situations. Donald Trump also took aim sarcastically mocking her as a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. French President Emmanuel Macron also warned her radical climate change stance risks depressing an entire generation. And some individuals were even more scathing with sick trolls branding her the little girl with mental problems and others suggesting shes not sexy enough in vile rants.	False	True	True	True	False
As international leaders gathered in New York for this weeks meeting of the United Nations General Assembly they got another taste of the Trump Administrations leadership style. It can be summed up in one word confusion. Sometimes it appears to be a result of ineptitude other times it appears to be tactical. Then came the election of Donald Trump. After months of intrigue about what he might do Trump announced in June that the United States plans to withdraw from the accord unless we can re enter on terms that are more favorable to our country. It seemed that Trump left the door open to reversing his decision. Recent events have offered a good opportunity for Trump to do so. Steve Bannon the senior advisor who reportedly pressed Trump to withdraw from the accord has left the White House. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma showed with unprecedented fury that global warming is putting Americans in greater jeopardy by making storms more destructive. And the current convergence of world leaders on New York gives them another opportunity to lobby Trump to reverse his position. As last weekend began the Wall Street Journal reported The Trump administration is considering staying in the Paris agreement to fight climate change under the right conditions offering to re engage in the international deal The White House shot down the story by responding that the presidents intentions have not changed. It was the latest example of the bewilderment Trump has created about whether or not the worlds second biggest source of climate altering pollution plans to do anything about it. First with his seemingly provisional withdrawal decision last June Trump used one of his deal making gambits. He announced an extreme position but hinted he was willing to negotiate. In reality there is no deal to be made and no interest among other nations to reopen an agreement that took the world 20 years to achieve. It appears that Trumps real purpose was to please his base while blunting criticism with the hint that he might change his mind. Second it is clear even now that Trump and his people do not understand the Paris accord. They seem not to have read it. It calls for voluntary commitments from nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. If Trump feels the climate action plan President Obama submitted under the Paris accord was somehow disadvantageous to the country he could simply submit a new plan. Instead Trump hopes to show that he is standing up to the world community on behalf of Americas interests. Tillerson exhibited his lack of understanding when he said Sunday if you look at those targets and terms of the Paris climate accord they were just really out of balance for the two largest economies. He presumably was talking about China and the United States who are also the worlds two largest carbon polluters. However the commitments that China and the United States submitted under the Paris accord reflected a historic bilateral agreement that the two nations announced in November 2014. On Sept. 3 2016 President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China jointly reaffirmed their commitments to the Paris deal offering a rare display of harmony as the New York Times put it. So Tillersons perception that the Paris accord is not good for China or the United States was not shared by the two nations leaders. Nor I assume is it shared by the hundreds of businesses and investors who urged Trump to remain in the pact. Other history contradicts the idea that the United States signed onto an out of balance deal. In 1997 most nations signed the Kyoto Protocol an agreement under which developed but not developing nations committed to reduce their carbon pollution. The premise was that the industrial economies were most responsible for the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and that developing countries needed to continue using fossil fuels for the immediate future to grow their economies. The U.S. Senate whose advice and consent was necessary before President Clinton could ratify the Protocol signaled that it would not concur. It approved a resolution saying that it would not consent to any agreement that did not also include greenhouse gas reductions by developing nations. As a result President Clinton did not bother to submit the Protocol to the Senate and in March 2001 President Bush announced officially that the U.S. would not participate. Third Trumps conditional willingness to reengage in international climate action is belied by the fact that he has laid waste to the federal governments ability to influence Americas carbon pollution. The United States would return to the table with little or nothing to offer in regard to our own substantial emissions.	False	False	False	False	True
One hardly knows where to begin in taking apart an argument that is literally filled with errors fallacies inconsistencies and non sequiturs. The essay by Nathan Schneider appearing in the May 31 issue of America titled Trumps war on the environment is a war on the young and the unborn makes the incredible case that withdrawing from the Paris agreement constitutes a war on future generations tantamount to genocide. No matter that historically the environmentalist movement has been closely allied with the population control movement literally waging a war on the unborn through its promotion of vigorous anti natality programs and abortion on demand. Mr. Schneider makes no effort to conceal his own apocalyptic vision of climate change. Without the Paris accord he claims mankind is a species embracing its own suicidal fragmentation. The climate will turn to chaos because Mr. Trump has issued the command that we are to proceed with the destruction of the planet. How a person can have such unshakable certainty in the outcome of complex future events is truly remarkable. The inability to entertain even the slightest doubt that carbon dioxide emissions will necessarily lead to climate Armageddon borders on meteorological Fundamentalism. To judge a particular accord as contrary to the nations interests on the other hand is hardly a war on the environment. Perhaps Mr. Schneider should consider what a war on the environment would actually look like. Pouring toxic waste into rivers filling the air with noxious fumes polluting forests and open countrysidethese are signs of a war on the environment and sadly they can still be found in certain nations. Carbon dioxide on the other hand is non toxic. It is fundamental to the life of plants and a necessary component of photosynthesis. Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses raising levels to three times that of the natural environment to produce stronger healthier plants. Current levels of carbon dioxide concentration in the environment are substantially lower than they have been during earlier periods in the planets history. Without human intervention the concentration of CO2 has climbed as high as 7000 parts per million ppm whereas at present the concentration is just over 400 ppm. Some such as UN climate scientist Dr. Indur Goklany who has previously represented the United States on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC have defended rising CO2 levels as a good thing for humanity. Goklany has argued that the rising level of carbon dioxide in the earths atmosphere is currently net beneficial for both humanity and the biosphere generally. The benefits are real whereas the costs of warming are uncertain he said. During his presidential campaign Donald Trump promised Americans that if elected he would make the United States energy independent and get out of the Paris climate deal. The fact that a president keeps his promises is usually considered a good thing. In point of fact Mr. Schneiders issue isnt just with the president it is with the nation that elected him. According to a recent study by the Pew Research Center a majority of Americans dont believe in manmade global warming. That doesnt put them at war with the environment and much less at war with the young and the unborn. Maybe they just want an America that is able to think and act for itself rather than one that bows to ever fad espoused by globalist elites.	True	True	False	True	False
One of the biggest legal battles over climate change is now in limbo pending a decision from the Supreme Courts chief justice who last week took the odd step of halting the lawsuit to consider a stay. The court is expected to rule Friday on whether the case which was expected to go to trial Monday can proceed. The suit Juliana v. US also known as the childrens climate lawsuit was first filed in 2015 and now includes 21 plaintiffs between the ages of 11 and 22 including Sophie Kivlehan 20 the granddaughter of the famed climate scientist James Hansen. The case argues that the US government undertook policies that contributed to climate change thereby causing irreparable harm to young people and denying them a safe climate. As relief they want the government to pursue policies to keep warming in check. The trial was supposed to begin at the United States District Court in Oregon on October 29. But last week the defendant the US government asked for a stay of the case arguing the costs of litigation would put an undue burden on it. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts granted a temporary stay and halted discovery until Wednesday to allow the plaintiffs to respond. The district court then vacated the case pending a decision from the high court. Working over the weekend the children and their lawyers filed a 103 page brief on Monday in hopes of receiving a decision from the Chief Justice before the weeks end. Now the case is back at the Supreme Court and what happens next is unclear including whether the other justices on the bench will weigh in. Several legal analysts told Vox it is extremely unusual for the Supreme Court to step in to block a legal proceeding in a lower court. Appeals from the District Court in Oregon are almost always handled by the 9th Circuit which has already declined to block the lawsuit. And one of the only other times Supreme Court has done something like this was also related to climate change. In 2016 the court stayed the Obama administrations Clean Power Plan to limit greenhouse gases from power plants pending ongoing lawsuits from states suing to block the rule from going into effect. But then the childrens lawsuit is an unusual case. The plaintiffs essentially are arguing that a safe climate is a civil right so the implications for climate change policy are huge. Though the case is in uncharted legal territory it has survived several legal challenges and motions to dismiss and lower federal courts have allowed it to proceed. Ann Carlson a professor of environmental law at the University of California Los Angeles said that the Supreme Court stepping in on a case like this strongly suggests theres something there that piques the courts interest. Its certainly a signal that the court is uncomfortable with the underlying legal theory of the Juliana case Carlson said. The federal government under Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump has argued the case has no merit and repeatedly sought to have it dismissed. Asked for comment the Department of Justice pointed to comments made by Jeffrey Wood a political appointee at the DOJ handling environmental cases who spoke about the Juliana case at a law conference last week. He said that the purported constitutional right that they assert simply does not exist and that the Juliana lawsuit has no legal basis. In our view the Oregon lawsuit is an unconstitutional attempt to use a single court to control the entire nations energy and climate policy Wood said adding the plaintiffs in Oregon are ignoring the fact that clean and responsible production and use of fossil fuels remains vital to the health and well being of the American people. For climate activists old and young the courts have become a last resort for pushing governments and businesses to reduce greenhouse gas emissions especially with an executive branch thats still denying climate change exists and a gridlocked Congress. There are also several ongoing climate change lawsuits filed by cities counties and a state against oil companies though the pivot points are different. The local governments are citing nuisance statutes and seeking money from oil companies to pay for damages caused by climate change whereas the childrens case is trying to force the government to enact policies to curb greenhouse gas emissions. But the prospects for the childrens climate lawsuit to succeed appear dim first because the courts tend to give wide latitude to the executive branch in these cases and second because the Supreme Courts newest Justice Brett Kavanaugh is much more skeptical of environmental regulations than his predecessor. This is just the beginning of what were likely to see from a Court that doesnt have Justice Kennedy on it anymore Carlson said.	False	False	False	False	False
BISMARCK N.D. AP A federal judge ruled Wednesday that the Dakota Access oil pipeline can continue operating while a study is completed to assess its environmental impact on an American Indian tribe. U.S. District Judge James Boasbergs decision will come as a blow to the Standing Rock Sioux who have argued that an oil spill from the pipeline under Lake Oahe from which the tribe draws its water could have a detrimental effect on the tribal community. Todays decision is a disappointing continuation of a historic pattern Other people get all the profits and the tribes get all the risk and harm said Jan Hasselman an Earthjustice attorney representing the tribe in an ongoing federal lawsuit through which Standing Rock and three other tribes still hope to shut down the pipeline. Boasberg found that it is likely the Army Corps of Engineers will be able to justify previous decisions made while permitting the pipeline. The Corps must simply connect the dots he said. This then is not a case in which the agency must redo its analysis from the ground up. Boasberg also acknowledged that shutting down the pipeline would disrupt the energy industry but said it wasnt a major factor in his decision. The 3.8 billion pipeline built by Texas based Energy Transfer Partners has been operating since June 1 moving oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a distribution point in Illinois. From there it can be shipped to the Gulf Coast and potentially lucrative markets abroad. It has the capacity to move half of the oil produced daily in North Dakota the nations second leading producer behind Texas. Energy industry officials applauded Boasbergs ruling with North Dakota Petroleum Council President Ron Ness calling the pipeline a critical part of American energy infrastructure. The Justice Department declined comment on behalf of the Corps. President Donald Trump had pushed for the pipelines completion and the Corps dropped a plan to conduct more environmental study after he took office. Boasberg ruled on June 14 that the Corps largely complied with environmental law but he ordered the agency to reconsider certain areas of its analysis and took arguments on whether to shut down the 1200 mile 1930 kilometer pipeline while the work is done. Boasberg in June said the Corps didnt adequately consider how an oil spill under the Lake Oahe reservoir on the Missouri River in the Dakotas might affect the Standing Rock Sioux. The tribe is among four that have challenged the pipeline in court over environmental fears that ETP says are unfounded. The judge said the Corps also didnt adequately study how the pipeline might disproportionately affect the tribal community a concept known as environmental justice. That aims to ensure development projects arent built in areas where minority populations might not have the resources to defend their rights. In its analysis of the Missouri River crossing the Corps studied the mostly white demographics in a half mile 0.8 kilometer radius which the agency maintains is standard. But if the agency had gone an additional 88 yards 80 meters about the length of a football field the study would have included the Standing Rock Reservation. Boasberg in his ruling Wednesday said that issue was a closer call than the others but that it still did not justify shutting down the pipeline. He noted that the tribes water intake has been moved about 50 miles 80 kilometers downstream since pipeline construction began and said an alternative river crossing near Bismarck that had been studied and rejected would pass much closer to a drinking water intake that serve tens of thousands more people. Risks presented to this tenfold increase in population must of course be considered the judge said. Corps attorneys said the agency expects to be able by next spring to substantiate its earlier determination that the pipeline poses no significant environmental threats. ETP maintained that a shutdown would cost it 90 million monthly and significantly disrupt the broader energy industry as well as state and local tax revenue. The North Dakota Pipeline Authority this week said that the Dakota Access pipeline boosted the states tax revenues by about 19 million in its first three months of operation. Tribal attorneys argued that ETP had overstated the potential effects of a shutdown and Boasberg acknowledged some cause for skepticism regarding ETPs predictions. Tribal attorneys also said a shutdown would create incentive for the Corps to take the review seriously. The tribes had proposed a fallback plan if Boasberg decided against a shutdown. It includes increased public reporting of pipeline issues such as repairs and implementation of a spill response plan including equipment staging at Lake Oahe. Boasberg said he will hear arguments on the matter. He scheduled a status conference for Oct. 18.	False	False	False	False	False
Environmental Protection Agency EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt told business advocates the agency will reconsider a rule utilities worry could force more coal fired power plants to close. I have decided that it is appropriate and in the public interest to reconsider the rule Pruitt wrote in a letter sent Wednesday to counsel for a utility group and officials at the U.S. Small Business Administration SBA. The EPA is acting promptly to issue an administrative stay of the compliance dates in the rule that have not yet passed pending judicial review Pruitt wrote regarding an EPA regulation on liquid waste from coal plants. Pruitt was responding to a petition sent by the Utility Water Action Group UWAG urging the Trump administration to rescind its Effluent Limitations Guidelines for coal fired power plants. UWAG argues the regulation will cause negative impacts on jobs due to the excessive costs of compliance which were grossly underestimated by EPA and regulatory burdens forcing plant closures. UWAG said EPA underestimated the rules costs and withheld records about the rulemaking from utilities who would have to comply with the rule which the agency estimates could cost up to 2.5 billion a year. To an unprecedented extent the Agency withheld fundamental information purporting to justify the Rule UWAG argued adding that included pages of the record that demonstrably were not entitled to confidential treatment. The EPA said in legal filings it withheld records to protect confidential business information. Pruitt said EPA would reconsider the ELG rule based on UWAGs concerns. Its the latest move by the Trump administration to ease the regulatory burden on the coal industry. President Donald Trump promised to lessen regulations on coal mines to put miners back to work. Trump has already signed executive orders to rescind EPA and Interior Department regulations on coal production and power generation. Most recently Trump ordered the EPA to review the Clean Power Plan which limits carbon dioxide emissions from new and existing power plants. That rule was also expected to force more coal plants to prematurely shutdown. Environmentalists were obviously outraged by Pruitts decision. Trumps attempt to halt these clean water protections for mercury lead and arsenic from coal power plants is dangerous and irresponsible said Mary Anne Hitt the director of the Sierra Clubs Beyond Coal campaign. The Obama administration finalized the ELG rule in 2015 and it went into effect in January 2016. The rule requires coal plants to install new equipment to curb pollution from wastewater streams. Utilities including UWAG took EPA to court to have the rule overturned. UWAG and others argued the rule violated the Clean Water Act and Administrative Procedures Act. Aside from arguing EPA improperly withheld data on how they came up with the rule plaintiffs argued the agency didnt perform proper testing to see if requiring coal plants to install new equipment would meet federal pollution guidelines. Environmentalists fought to keep the rule in place and Pruitt can expect legal challenges if EPA tries to repeal the ELG rule. Trump claimed he wanted EPA to go back to basics and focus on clean air and water in his Administration but one of the first actions by his EPA Administrator is an attempt to gut an important water pollution safeguard Hitt said.

Adopting more active forest management policies such as increased thinning of trees and conducting controlled burns will help mitigate damage from future wildfires the Los Angeles Times editorial board writes. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke began advocating similar policy prescriptions earlier in 2018 after President Donald Trump blamed Californias bad environmental laws for creating a wildfire prone environment.RELATED Trump Administration Is Taking Its Fight Against Bad Environmental Laws Straight To California California forests have grown drier and less healthy from overcrowded trees infestations of bark beetles and the effects of climate change the LA Timeswrites. Californias restrictions on active forest management have contributed to the poor and worsening conditions of the forests allowing them to grow uninhibited while suppressing fires that would normally naturally control the forests growth. Fire is not necessarily bad for forests. California used to burn with regularity and low intensity fires are vital in some ecosystems to clear excess brush and small trees from the landscape the editorial board writes. But theres been a change in fire behavior over the last century as the state and federal government began dousing the blazes. Decades of fire suppression have allowed forests to grow dense with trees. Combined with drought insect infestations and the stress of a warming climate those management practices have led to more intense and destructive fires that are more dangerous to people living near the forests and more damaging to air quality the op ed continues. Californias environmental laws entered the national spotlight in early August when Trumpblamedthem for the severity of the wildfires that were ravaging the state. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke was soon at the front of the administrations push for California to begin adopting more active land management policies. Zinke traveled to California to see the damage from the fires and meet with local officials and firefighters Aug. 13. Zinke ramped up calls for greater forest thinning while also dismissing the idea that climate change is playing a significant factor in the wildfires intensity.RELATED Ryan Zinke Shifts The Wildfire Debate From Global Warming To Anti Logging Environmental Terrorists Ive heard the climate change argument back and forth Zinke told Sacramento based KCRA. This has nothing to do with climate change. This has to do with active forest management. California Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown partnered with state lawmakers to introduce changes to the states policies. The bill would grant 1 billion toward forest thinning and ease regulations on cutting trees on private property according to the LA Times.	False	False	False	False	False
The pictures are striking dozens of whales lie stranded on an idyllic beach in a remote part of New Zealand. The group were found by a walker on Stewart Island earlier this week. And just a few days later a further 51 pilot whales died after becoming stranded on a beach on the Chatham Islands. While whale strandings are not uncommon they usually involve just a single animal rather than a whole group. The recent flurry of mass strandings has brought a renewed focus on the mysterious and rare phenomenon. So why does it happen? While the exact reasons remain unclear experts say many different factors could play a part. Quite often animals that turn up on a beach are getting exhausted they're malnourished or they haven't eaten because they're ill says Dr Simon Ingram a Professor of Marine Conservation at the University of Plymouth. They can be in the final stages of being ill or die at sea and end up getting washed up on a beach he adds. But Dr Ingram says that sickness or injury mainly plays a part when a single animal is found stranded. The trouble is that in a huge number of animals it's quite likely that some of them are going to be ill anyway he explains. It's also true that there have been cases where groups of healthy whales have ended up getting stranded. So what could be behind these cases? Some experts say that certain aspects of the coastline or sea bed can disorientate whales especially if they roam outside of their usual habitat. Some places like the tip of New Zealand are hotspots for stranding says Dr Ingram. Sometimes this is due to geographic features of the coastline. If there's a feature like a peninsular or headland then animals that should be in deeper waters may suddenly find themselves in a confusing shallow bay. Shallow water can pose a risk to pilot whales in particular because of the way in which they navigate and communicate. These animals forage and feed largely by echolocation says Dr Andrew Brownlow a veterinary pathologist who has undertaken post mortems on stranded pilot whales in Scotland. So they use sound to navigate and communicate and find their prey. Using echolocation in areas with very shallow silty mud is like trying to walk through a forest on a foggy day he explains It's very hard to get your bearings and see clearly. This combination of shallow waters and confused muddled echolocation is a serious danger and may lead to mass strandings. They end up coming into shallow areas and get stranded by the receding tide so the natural lay of the land is a real risk factor for these animals Dr Brownlow says. But if a single whale gets injured or lost why do they end up beached in such large numbers? Experts say the answer lies in their herd like behaviour. It's a problem you get with these very social animals that tend to for reasons we have never been clear on end up following either a sick leader onto the beach or end up getting lost as a group Dr Brownlow says. This particular species seems to be very prone to that herd behaviour. It means that if one pilot whale encounters a problem then it can have an impact on the entire group. Dr Brownlow points to one case in 2015 when around 30 whales became stranded on the Isle of Skye off Scotland's west coast. We think that was because one of the females was having trouble giving birth and was in a lot distress he explains. She came into shallow waters and all the other members of the group followed her onto the beach. Another possible cause of strandings some experts suggest is warmer water temperatures. We've had an unusual week which we haven't got to the bottom of and it's fair to say it's been an entirely unusual year Dr Karen Stockin a marine mammal scientist based at New Zealand's Massey University told AFP news agency after the latest mass stranding. I suspect a lot of that has been driven by the warmer sea surface temperatures that we're seeing at the moment. She explained That's likely affecting where the prey is moving and as a consequence we're seeing prey moving and whale species following. New Zealand's summer begins on Saturday and Dr Stockin warned that there could be more beachings to come. We're just going into stranding season now this is only the beginning of it and we're very mindful of the fact that this a very busy start she said. While Dr Stockin says that global warming may be playing apart in the rising sea temperatures most experts say that it's important not to jump to conclusions about the role of humans in these cases. Pilot whales have probably been stranding in New Zealand since before people lived there Dr Ingram says. It's probably not anything to do with what humans have done. It's a very dynamic ecosystem that these animals are in so I would be very cautious in making any connection between these examples and climate change.	False	False	False	False	False
Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden really grabbed the audiences eyes at the climate change town hall literally as his eye filled with blood after a lackluster performance marked by half truths and excuses. The former Vice President was clearly floundering during CNNs climate change town hall on Wednesday which saw him face off against eight other Democrats. Viewers called him out for rambling incoherent answers and held his feet to the fire regarding his coziness with the fossil fuel industry. Then his left eye began filling up with blood. At around the same time his campaign cautioned voters not to turn a blind eye to the way in which environmental burdens are distributed unevenly along racial and socioeconomic lines an ironic coincidence or a sly reference to the unusual anatomic event? Before Bidens eye exploded the audience had been raking him over the coals for a scheduled fundraiser the following night at the home of a natural gas executive. The three time candidate has never been particularly committed to green issues slammed by environmental groups for not having a climate change policy he finally released one in June that contained several plagiarized items. But he had along with most of the other Democratic candidates promised not to take money from the fossil fuel industry a promise the fundraiser seemed to break to viewers dismay. But even the most blatant political hypocrisy was no match for the eye. Look Biden haters sometimes your eye is gonna spontaneously fill up with blood okay one user joked. Twitter furiously deploying algorithms to keep Bidens bloody corpse eye from trending observed another it appeared to work while was trending and variations thereof were noticeably not. Apparently it wasnt even the first time Bidens eye has filled up with blood during an important political event. But some commenters found a way to bring the conversation back to the environment. Not sure after tonight who has less time to live Biden or the planet said one. Joe Biden lied so hard during the climate town hall that his eye started bleeding commented another. I give it 14 minutes before Bidens campaign says his bloody eye was because of climate change predicted another. Meanwhile others made the inevitable comparisons to Hillary Clinton another candidate with a marked enthusiasm gap between donors and voters who has run for president and lost before yet is propped up by the media as the surefire winner. And some took time out from gawking to worry about his health since political speeches dont normally cause visible injury. Does Biden have a blood clot in his left eye? wondered one user. This cant be good news given his health history noted another. Like this story? Share it with a friend!	False	False	False	False	False
Dozens of countries have extraordinary tropical forests but three stand out Brazil Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. These countries not only have the largest areas of tropical forest within their borders they also have the highest rates of deforestation. Dozens of countries have extraordinary tropical forests but three stand out Brazil Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. These countries not only have the largest areas of tropical forest within their borders they also have the highest rates of deforestation. We traveled to protected areas deep inside these countries to learn the superpowers of three tree species that play an unusually important part in staving off environmental disaster not just locally but globally. These trees play many ecological roles but most impressive is how they produce rainfall remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and support hundreds of other species. If these ecosystems collapse the climate effects are likely to be irreversible. And so what happens to these forests truly affects all life on Earth. This is the story of three trees at the center of our climate crisis that provide big benefits to you me and the whole world. Meet the trees get to know their superpowers and learn how scientists are trying to protect them. This project was supported by the Pulitzer Center.	False	False	False	False	False
Chew On This Farmers Are Using Food Waste To Make Electricity This story was produced as part of a collaboration with the PBS NewsHour As the season of big holiday meals kicks off it's as good a time as any to reflect on just how much food goes to waste. If you piled up all the food that's not eaten over the course of a year in the U.S. it would be enough to fill a skyscraper in Chicago about 44 times according to an estimate from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. And when all this food rots in a landfill it emits methane a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. In fact a recent report from the United Nations from a panel of climate experts estimates that up to 10 percent of all human made greenhouse gas emissions are linked to food waste. So here's one solution to the problem Dairy farmers in Massachusetts are using food waste to create electricity. They feed waste into anaerobic digesters built and operated by Vanguard Renewables which capture the methane emissions and make renewable energy. The process begins by gathering wasted food from around the state including from many Whole Foods locations. We visited the chain's store in Shrewsbury Mass. which has installed a Grind2Energy system. It's an industrial strength grinder that gobbles up all the scraps of food the store can't sell explains Karen Franczyk who is the sustainability program manager for Whole Foods' North Atlantic region. The machine will grind up all kinds of food waste everything from bones we put whole fish in here to vegetables to dry items like rice or grains Franczyk says as the grinder is loaded. It also takes frying fats and greases. While Whole Foods donates a lot of surplus food to food banks there's a lot waste left over. Much of it is generated from prepping prepared foods. Just as when you cook in your own kitchen there are lots of bits that remain such as onion or carrot peel rinds stalks or meat scraps. The grinder turns all these bits into a slurry. It really becomes kind of a liquefied food waste Franczyk says. From here the waste is loaded into a truck and sent to an anaerobic digester. There's no question it's better than putting it in the trash Franczyk says. She says the chain is committed to diverting as much waste as possible and aims for zero waste. In addition to food donations Whole Foods composts this waste to energy system is yet another way to meet its goal. We really do like the system she says. We visited Bar Way Farm Inc. in Deerfield Mass. Owner Peter Melnik a fourth generation dairy farmer showed us how his anaerobic digester which is installed next to his dairy barn works. We presently take in about a 100 tons of waste which is about three tractor trailer loads every day Melnik says. In addition to all the food waste from Whole Foods he gets whey from a Cabot Creamery in the area as well as waste from a local brewery and a juice plant. In the digester he combines all of this waste with manure from his cows. The mixture cooks at about 105 degrees Fahrenheit. As the methane is released it rises to the top of a large red tank with a black bubble shaped dome. We capture the gas in that bubble. Then we suck it into a big motor Melnik explains. Unlike other engines that run on diesel or gasoline this engine runs on methane. This turns a big generator which is creating one megawatt of electricity continuously Melnik says enough to power more than just his farm. We only use about 10 percent of what we make and the rest is fed onto the electricity grid Melnik explains. It's enough to power about 1500 homes. He says times are tough for dairy farmers so this gives him a new stream of revenue. Vanguard pays him rental fees for having the anaerobic digester on his farm. In addition he's able to use the liquids left over from the process as fertilizer on his fields. The digester has been a home run for us Melnik says. It's made us more sustainable environmentally and also economically. Vanguard Renewables hopes to expand its operations in the state and elsewhere. There's more than enough food waste in Massachusetts to feed all of our five digesters plus many more says CEO John Hanselman. Massachusetts has a state law that prohibits the disposal of commercial organic waste including food by businesses and institutions that generate at least one ton of this waste per week. This has created an incentive for food businesses to participate in the waste to energy initiative. Hanselman points to Europe where there are thousands of digesters in operation. His hope is that the concept will spread here. The food waste recycling through anaerobic digestion could be done in every part of the country Hanselman says. The company is currently building an anaerobic digester on a farm in Vermont. The gas produced there will be piped to Middlebury College which will help the college reduce its carbon footprint.

Why progressives refuse to live by their own Earth Day bluster George Monbiot recently expressed a carefully calibrated environmental message that allows people on the environmental left to feel self righteous without making any real sacrifice. In a video that was shared widely including by celebrities such as James Corden the British writer argues that the only way to help the environment is to change the big structural political economic stuff. Monbiot concludes that we need to go straight to the heart of capitalism and overthrow it. At the same time he dismisses pathetic micro consumerist bollocks which just isnt going to get us anywhere. This is absolution for those who want to feel green but cant be bothered with going to the effort and expense of actually living their own values. Publicly advocating the do as I say not as I do approach reinforces the reality that conservatives tend to live out the environmental ethic that the Left only preaches. As a conservative who has worked in environmental policy for two decades I have been frustrated watching as ideological fellow travelers avoid environmental topics even as they privately express their commitment to environmental stewardship. As the Left becomes more detached from responsible and effective environmental solutions conservatives should confidently fill the void. One reason conservatives do not engage is that environmentalism has become synonymous with horrible government policy. Every Earth Day we are treated to theatrical images of marches featuring unhinged activists demanding action on a range of environmental issues. Clever hashtags are generated. Alarmist slogans are flaunted. Naked people glue themselves to park benches. And all who disagree with the demands for more government power are denigrated as deniers. The other 364 days of the year however people on the left do little in their daily lives to justify all that environmental browbeating. A study by researchers at the University of Michigan and Cornell University found that those who are highly concerned about climate change are least likely to report individual level actions to reduce their environmental impact. Those who considered themselves skeptical of climate change were most likely to report engaging in individual level pro environmental behaviors. To be sure not all conservatives are skeptical of climate change but generally we arent nearly as alarmist about climate change or other environmental issues even when we recognize the risk. That gap between the Lefts loud talk and their unwillingness to make personal sacrifices is not an accident. It is now part of their dogma. Individual actions are mere bollocks useless gestures. Only the sacrifices made by others will make a difference. This dichotomy is evident in my home state of Washington where politicians pride themselves on showing leadership in the effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This year our legislature enacted a law requiring the state to meet a 100 percent renewable energy target by 2045. Environmental activists tweeted their support saying they demand action now and worrying about the climate crisis. Ironically though many who demand action do little of it themselves. For only a few dollars a month anyone who supports renewable energy can already buy renewable energy credits RECs ensuring that there is enough renewable energy on the grid to cover their personal use. I asked one politician pushing for the 100 percentrenewable requirement if she buys RECs to cover her environmental impact. She admitted that she does not and has no plans to do so. This is consistent with the message of Monbiot and political leaders pushing the Green New Deal. Personal sacrifice is of little consequence so why even try? Even as they call for an end to air travel politicians who demand we impose lifestyle change have not curtailed their own carbon producing travel despite living in the era of HD video conferencing. The most effective environmental efforts are often small personal actions in which people have skin in the game. Farmers find ways to conserve water because waste costs money. Aluminum cans are lighter today because it saves resources and they cost less to ship. Homeowners and businesses conserve energy because they pay the price for every kilowatt hour. When they dont save they change course unlike politicians who fear public embarrassment and throw good money after bad. This isnt just a theory. The amount of energy per unit of GDP in the United States has fallen steadily for several decades. There are no sharp drops. Instead the improvement is gradual and constant as individuals and businesses find ways to squeeze a bit more out of their energy use. Politicians can lecture all they want but these are truly the front lines of environmental stewardship. As Earth Day 2019 came and went the pattern of environmentalists demanding action that they themselves wont take predictably repeated itself. The pattern of conservatives avoiding talk of environmental stewardship even as they live it every day however is a pattern we should break. Effective environmental policy doesnt start with politicians and publicity stunts. Conservatives understand this. We should make it clear that personal environmental stewardship is not only more effective it is a more moral way to live.	False	False	False	False	False
Spurred by what they see as a sluggish ineffectual response to the existential threat of global warming student activists from around the world plan to skip school today for what organizers call a Global Climate Strike. The focus for young activists is the United Nations Climate Action Summit taking place Monday in New York City. The strike's figurehead is 16 year old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg who traveled from Sweden to New York on an emission free sailboat. A little over a year ago Thunberg began her school strike for the climate by herself outside the Swedish Parliament. Support for a school climate strike has since spread across the globe. In the last year Thunberg has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by Norwegian lawmakers. She's also met with Pope Francis and lawmakers in several countries. We are currently on track for a world that could displace billions of people from their homes Thunberg warned this week during a speech accepting Amnesty International's Ambassador of Conscience Award. She ended her acceptance speech with a call to action See you on the streets! In New York City thousands of students may fill the streets with Thunberg because as the school district announced on Twitter it is giving strikers excused absences. In Oregon Portland Public Schools is doing the same. Strikes also are planned in rural areas where just a few dozen protesters are expected. Nicholas DuVernay 17 organized a protest in his politically conservative small town of La Grande Ore. Since probably the beginning of my junior year in high school I've been interested in climate science and pretty passionate about environmental topics says DuVernay who plans to study climate science when he attends college next year. A Washington Post Kaiser Family Foundation poll this week shows a majority of teenagers believe human caused climate change will cause harm to them. And a quarter of the poll respondents said they have participated in a school walk out a rally or contacted a government official on the issue. There have been similar student events in the past year. But this time students are asking adults to join them. At the University of Nevada Reno Stallar Lufrano Jardine 36 is setting up an event on campus where she's an employee and student. I'm bothered by the lack of movement to make meaningful advances to solve the climate crisis says Lufrano Jardine. But it's clear younger people are leading this movement and they say most adults especially policy makers are moving far too slowly. Strike organizers have a list of demands that includes respect of indigenous land sustainable agriculture protecting biodiversity environmental justice and a just transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy said 17 year old Baltimore resident and organizer Nadia Nazar. Many of those demands are part of the Green New Deal which was crafted by progressive Democratic lawmakers but so far hasn't gone anywhere in Congress. At a Capitol Hill press event this week Nazar said she hopes the proposal defines her generation. I am not a part of Generation Z. I am a part of Gen GND the generation of the Green New Deal said Nazar as supporters cheered. Also on Capitol Hill this week Thunberg and other activists testified before lawmakers. Louisiana Republican Rep. Garret Graves told them climate change has exacerbated the loss of his state's coastline. I agree that we need to take aggressive action. I agree that we need to ensure that we move forward in a sustainable rational manner said Graves. But his idea of what that means is very different than the activists' vision. Graves agrees with President Trump on the need to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. Graves told the student organizers the pact allows China to continue emitting more carbon dioxide while the U.S. cuts emissions. Paris and its related pledges would undermine U.S. competitiveness his spokesman said. Graves got immediate push back from the young activists including 17 year old Jamie Margolin from Seattle who asked how Graves will respond to questions from his children and grandchildren about whether he did enough to address climate change. Can you really look them in the eye and say 'No sorry I couldn't do anything because that country over there didn't do anything so if they're not going to do it then I'm not.' That is shameful and that is cowardly Margolin said. Organizers predict this climate strike will be the largest yet. More than 2000 scientists around the world have pledged to join. Some companies also have signed on including Patagonia and Seventh Generation.	False	False	False	False	False
Energy and investment executives who met with Pope Francis earlier in June stood mostly in agreement that a tax on carbon emissions is the best path forward to combating climate change. Pope Francishosted a two day summit at the Vatican on June 8 and 9 inviting key players in the oil and gas industry for a back and forth discussion on climate change. The leader of the Catholic Church encouraged executives to give up fossil fuels and embrace renewable energy technology. The meeting was just the latest in a series of public moves the pope has made against traditional forms of electricity production. Most who took part in the summit agreed that afee on carbon emissions is pivotal in reforming the U.S. energy sector according to an Axios report. Ernest Moniz who served as an energy secretary under the Obama administration took part in the summit and said one of the areas of focus was carbon pricing to create market incentives for the transition to a low carbon system. Key members who met with Pope Francis includeExxonMobil Chief Executive Darren WoodsBP CEOBob Dudley Equinor CEOEldar Saetre and numerous others. The idea of a carbon tax a fee charged onto companies according to the amount of carbon emissions their plants emit into the atmosphere has been recommended as a market friendly method to controlling CO2 pollution. While carbon tax proposals appeared popular at the Vatican it has not garnered the same amount of support in Congress. Majority Whip Steve Scalise and West Virginia Rep. David McKinley introduced a House resolution in April that explicitly condemns a tax on carbon dioxide pollution. RELATEDPope Criticizes Oil Executives Silent On Ireland Legalizing Abortion In a public letter of support for Scalises resolution a group of conservative organizations claimed thata carbon tax would ultimately result in a loss of jobs and higher electricity bills For example a 2014 Heritage Foundation report found that a 37 per ton carbon tax would lead to a loss of more than 2.5 trillion in aggregate gross domestic product by 2030. That is more than 21000 in income loss per family a portion of the letter read. In addition a carbon tax would cost over 500000 jobs in manufacturing and more than 1 million jobs by 2030. According to a 2013 CBO report a carbon tax is highly regressive. House members have yet to vote on the anti carbon tax resolution. However the lower chamber of Congresspasseda similar version in June 2016 collecting six Democratic votes and zero Republicans opposition.

One of the attorneys heading New York Citys climate litigation made comments in September that could seriously harm the citys mission to sue oil companies for contributing to global warming. New York Citys climate lawsuits are ultimately designed to target the industrys financial bottom line Susan Amron the chief of the environmental law division of the New York City Law Department said at a Sept. 26 panel discussion during the Climate Week NYC. Sowere not saying you cant use fossil fuels thats a different part of the citys efforts Amron said during the panel noting also that the lawsuit is designed to impress on companies the need to internalize the costs fossil fuels impose on cities. She appeared to contradict herself a few sentences later telling the audience that the intent is really to eliminate the oil industrys license to operate. Andreally what were trying to do is affect the bottom line the financial equation for the use of fossil fuels she said. We just acted and I want to urge every city every county every state to do the same divest. Divest from the fossil fuel industry De Blasio told the Vermont Democrat at the time. Lets help bring the death knell to this industry thats done so much harm. The lawsuit was dismissed in July a handful of months after De Blasio made his comment. Judge John Keenan wrote in hisopinionat the time that legislative branch was the appropriate arena to address global warming. NYCs lawsuit does appear to suggest the intent is not to destroy but rather to mitigate harm. The City does not seek to impose liability on Defendants for their direct emissions of greenhouse gases anddoes not seek to restrain Defendants from engaging in their business operations the city wrote in its complaint. Amrons admission will likely create challenges forthe citys appeal which is slated to begin in front of the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals soon. Neither Amron nor New York Citys Law Department have responded to The Daily Caller News Foundations request for an explanation about the lawsuit is designed to hammer the oil industry or for mitigation purposes. Other climate lawsuits across the country are similarly on the ropes. Cities in California Colorado and Rhode Island have also filed similar lawsuits against energy producers over the past year. They argue that Exxon and others should pony up money for mitigation efforts designed to forestall the effects from climate change. A judge dismissed lawsuits in Oakland and San Francisco arguing that the U.S. Congress is only the governmental body responsible for enacting policies needed to mitigate global warming. Manufacturers and conservative groups worry trial attorneys are behind the spat of climate litigation. Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP handled lawsuits on behalf of the two California cities and New York City in exchange for a percentage of any winnings called a contingency fee.RELATED Trial Lawyers Handling Cities Global Warming Lawsuits Stand To Make Billions Hagens Bermanstood to earn billions of dollarsin contingency fees depending on the total winnings from a favorable judgement against oil companies.

Environmental activists occupy the office of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi this past December. They plan more sit ins to push for support of a sweeping resolution to address climate change. J. Scott ApplewhiteAP hide caption toggle caption J. Scott ApplewhiteAP Environmental activists occupy the office of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi this past December. They plan more sit ins to push for support of a sweeping resolution to address climate change. J. Scott ApplewhiteAP For a nonbinding resolution with an uncertain future the Green New Deal Green New Deal FINAL is getting a lot of attention along with a decidedly mixed reaction. Dozens of Democrats on Thursday introduced alexandria ocasio cortez releases green new deal outlinethe measure an ambitious framework for future legislation designed to eliminate the U.S. carbon footprint by 2030. Our energy future will not be found in the dark of a mine but in the light of the sun said Sen. Ed Markey D Mass. as he announced the legislation on Capitol Hill. The resolution has few details but it aims to overhaul the U.S. economy and spread wealth more evenly. It calls for a speedy shift in energy generation from fossil fuels to renewable sources like wind and solar and for a fair and just transition for all communities and workers. Much of the early criticism revolves around the scope of the plan which backers say is big to match the challenge of the climate change problem. All great American programs everything from The Great Society to The New Deal started with a vision for our future said co sponsor Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D N.Y. But this vision is for an extremely near term future. I'm afraid I just cannot see how we could possibly go to zero carbon in a 10 year time frame former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz tells NPR's All Things Considered. Moniz now CEO of Energy Futures Initiative agrees that the U.S. needs to pick up the pace of its shift away from carbon but he calls the decade long time frame impractical. He worries it could turn off key constituencies needed in the climate effort including labor unions oil companies and the business community. I'm afraid I just cannot see how we could possibly go to zero carbon in a 10 year time frame. Ernest Moniz former energy secretary and CEO of Energy Futures Initiative The Green New Deal doesn't even mention some of the usual ideas for addressing climate change such as a carbon tax or cap and trade program. Instead it calls for lots of spending to create among other things infrastructure and transport that don't rely on fossil fuels. Environmental groups generally support the resolution. It is a breath of fresh air to see leaders in Congress discussing climate solutions that rise to the scale of the challenge said Aliya Haq federal policy director for the Climate Clean Energy Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council in a statement 1. But some groups were disappointed the plan doesn't call for a complete end to using fossil fuels. We have 12 years according to science if we're going to meet the challenge of the climate crisis. And to do that we have to tackle fossil fuels head on. And the resolution just doesn't quite get us there says Nicole Ghio senior fossil fuel program manager at Friends of the Earth. The oil industry says it's already reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the electricity sector as coal plants switch to natural gas. They need to do a whole lot more homework These days transportation accounts for the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions greenhouse gas emissions. Green New Deal backers say they want more high speed trains to make airline travel less necessary and more electric cars and charging stations. But experts warn that changing the existing fleet of cars in the U.S. would be an extraordinary effort. There's 350 million liquid fuel cars on the road today in the United States and most Americans don't buy a new car except every decade says Amy Myers Jaffe director of the program on Energy Security and Climate Change at the Council on Foreign Relations. Green New Deal backers say they also want to eventually phase out nuclear energy which currently supplies 20 percent of electricity in the U.S. The Nuclear Energy Institute argues in a statement nei statement on green new deal that its electricity is carbon free and should be a part of any program addressing climate change. The proposal takes aim at methane from cows too. Methane is an especially potent greenhouse gas and cows produce a lot of it. But the beef industry is at a loss to respond because of the lack of details in the Green New Deal. They need to do a whole lot more homework and much more research and analysis before we can ever even really engage in this discussion says Colin Woodall senior vice president of government affairs for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. So far the plan's biggest success may be that it's energizing thousands of young activists. A group called the Sunrise Movement held a Web meeting with supporters email green new deal livestream recordingemailreferreremail490282emailsubjectgreen new deal livestream recording around the country Tuesday. Jeremy Ornstein 18 says he deferred going to college to work with the organization. Ornstein is among the Sunrise Movement organizers who plan three weeks of activism including lobbying members of Congress to sign onto the Green New Deal. And we're going to give our elected officials a deadline. They've got to get an answer to us by Feb. 26 or face the consequences warns Ornstein. He says activists around the country will occupy members' offices in what the group calls a nationwide day of action. Given the scope and ambitious nature of the Green New Deal it might be tempting to criticize or dismiss activists supporting it. But Amy Myers Jaffe hopes older more experienced policymakers won't do that. We need not to discourage them she says. They have an energy and will to innovation that is not only infectious but inspiring. And she says that could be what's needed to address a problem as daunting as climate change.

According toDaniel Rothman professor of geophysics in the MIT Department of Earth Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences and co director of MITs Lorenz Center we are fast approaching thresholds of catastrophe in the carbon cycle which make doom almost inevitable. In a paper published today inScience Advances he proposes that mass extinction occurs if one of two thresholds are crossed For changes in the carbon cycle that occur over long timescales extinctions will follow if those changes occur at rates faster than global ecosystems can adapt. For carbon perturbations that take place over shorter timescales the pace of carbon cycle changes will not matter instead the size or magnitude of the change will determine the likelihood of an extinction event. Taking this reasoning forward in time Rothman predicts that given the recent rise in carbon dioxide emissions over a relatively short timescale a sixth extinction will depend on whether a critical amount of carbon is added to the oceans. That amount he calculates is about 310 gigatons which he estimates to be roughly equivalent to the amount of carbon that human activities will have added to the worlds oceans by the year 2100. If we get a repeat of the Great Dying 275 million years ago what this means basically is that we are all going to die. Even you. But before you ring up your grandchildren and warnthem to cancel the marquee theyve booked for their 100th birthday celebrations perhaps a note of caution should be attached to professor Rothmans cheery prediction. First lets not forget it that itis flatly contradicted by the recent bombshell study suggesting that the effects of carbon dioxide on global warming have been overstated that the computer models are running too hot and that were not about to fry any time soon. Second Rothman appears to have given himself so much margin for error as to render his doomsday projection meaningless. Does this mean that mass extinction will soon follow at the turn of the century? Rothman says it would take some time about 10000 years for such ecological disasters to play out. However he says that by 2100 the world may have tipped into unknown territory. This is not saying that disaster occurs the next day Rothman says. Its saying that if left unchecked the carbon cycle would move into a realm which would be no longer stable and would behave in a way that would be difficult to predict. In the geologic past this type of behavior is associated with mass extinction. R i g h t. So what youre saying Dr Rothman is that youre allowing plus or minus 10000 years leeway for this mass extinction which wont definitely happen but which may happen. Do you know what? Even though Im not a professor of geophysics at MIT I think even I could have come up with a scientific theory as rock solid and testable as that one.	False	False	False	False	False
In the wake of Hurricane Irma the New York Times advanced the climate change agenda from every angle in Tuesdays edition. First up the paper featured more odd respect for religion from its colorful left wing reporter Jason Horowitz in Pope in the Air Puts Foot Down on Climate Change Denial and DACA Reversal. The text box The pontiff says pro life believers must defend the unity of the family. And another Times reporter stuck up for the tasteless global warming warriors using Hurricane Irma to forward climate change. A paper loathe to credit Christianity for pro life or traditional marriage views readily broadcasts the left wing views of Pope Francis and in particular his bashing of Donald Trump As he flew near Caribbean islands devastated by Hurricane Irma on his way back to the Vatican from Colombia on Sunday Pope Francis said that political leaders and others who denied climate change reminded him of a passage from the psalms about mans stubbornness. Man is stupid the Bible said he said. Its like that when you dont want to see you dont see. In a typically wide ranging news conference that included his questioning of United States President Donald J. Trumps commitment to issues of life because of his plan to strip undocumented immigrant children of protections from deportation the pope urged those who denied climate change to consult scientists who had clearly determined it was real and that humanity would go down if global warming was not recognized and addressed. Then he said decide and history will judge the decisions. During Mr. Trumps May visit to the Vatican the pope gave him a copy of his 2015 encyclical letter Laudato Si which called for a human response to global warming and top Vatican officials appealed to the president not to withdraw from the landmark Paris climate accord. Weeks later Mr. Trump pulled out of the agreement. It wasnt just global warming. Horowitz also used Pope Francis to criticize Trumps move to end DACA On the flight the pope nevertheless appealed again to Mr. Trump this time on his decision to end President Obamas Deferred Action for Children Program known as DACA. The program allows children brought illegally to the United States to stay without fear of deportation. Mr. Trump has given Congress which has failed to pass immigration overhaul for the last decade six months to enact legislation to resolve the status of about 800000 people affected by his decision. When the Times doesnt challenge a pro life message better read closely. I hope they rethink it a bit he said. Because I heard the U.S. president speak. He presents himself as a man who is pro life. If he is a good pro life believer he must understand that family is the cradle of life and one must defend its unity said Francis who in the past has said that advocates like Mr. Trump of a wall to keep out migrants on the Mexican border were not Christian. Horowitz showed himself not so fond of more conservative Catholics in an August report for the Times in which he made common cause with a piece making the rounds of Catholic intellectual circles singling out ultraconservative Trump supporting conservatives as dangerous From the Vatican a Warning Shot for Hard Line Catholics in the U.S. Meanwhile reporter Lisa Friedman on Tuesday used a comment from the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to stick up for the tasteless global warming warriors now using the tragedy of Hurricane Irma to forward their environmental agenda in For E.P.A. Chief Discussing Climate After Storms Is Insensitive. The text box Concerns that the U.S. is dodging questions on global warming. Friedman found a Republican to mouth concern over climate change and promptly teed him up in paragraph two while instantly identifying her by party something the paper consistently fails to do with Democrats in trouble Scott Pruitt the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency says it is insensitive to discuss climate change in the midst of deadly storms. Toms Regalado the Republican mayor of Miami whose citizens raced to evacuate before Hurricane Irma says if not now when? For scientists drawing links between warming global temperatures and the ferocity of hurricanes is about as controversial as talking about geology after an earthquake. But in Washington where science is increasingly political the fact that oceans and atmosphere are warming and that the heat is propelling storms into superstorms has become as sensitive as talking about gun control in the wake of a mass shooting. Ben Kirtman a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Miamis Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science said he believes failing to discuss climate change hurts Florida and the entire country. Dr. Kirtman and Dr. Berry are among a group of Florida scientists who confronted Governor Rick Scott in recent years for his refusal to acknowledge that human made greenhouse gases are driving climate change. Last year they wrote a letter to then candidate Donald J. Trump asking for a meeting to discuss the consequences of climate change in Florida. They said the Trump campaign never responded. In Florida scientists say Gov. Scotts aversion to even the words climate change have prompted scientists to self censor their work. If you write a proposal and it talks about fixing some infrastructure because of climate change its not going anywhere Mr. Kirtman said. You spend an awful lot of effort word searching your document for the words climate and change. Its silliness. That is one reason many scientists maintain it is critical to use the megaphone that the dual devastation of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma has provided. People they note are finally paying attention. Friedman cited an obscure news source to make her case of benighted Republicans ignoring the obvious facts of climate change	False	False	False	False	False
Any proposal to avert the climate crisis must include a full fracking ban on public and private lands Sanders said Wednesday ahead of CNNs seven hour climate change town hall. He continued calling the concept of safe fracking pure fiction and decrying the release of methane from natural gas as a major contributing factor to climate change. Fracking is a danger to our water supply. Its a danger to the air we breathe. It causes earthquakes. Its highly explosive. Safe fracking is like clean coal pure fiction Sanders continued. But most importantly methane from natural gas contributes to climate change and is setting us on a path to disaster he added. When we are in the White House we will end the era of fossil fuels and that includes fracking Sanders call to ban fracking is not necessarily new. The Vermont senator promised in March that his administration would ban fracking nationwide and rapidly move to renewable energy Sanders also called for a full ban on fracking as part of his 16 trillion Green New Deal proposal released last month. Fracking and mountaintop removal coal mining are two particularly harmful methods used to extract fossil fuels his plan states. They make surrounding communities less healthy and less safe. They must be immediately banned. Former Vice President Joe Biden D has also expressed a desire to ban fracking telling CNNs Dana Bash that his administration would work to eliminate it. Just to clarify would there be any place for fossil fuels including coal and fracking in a Biden administration Bash asked during Julys Democrat debate in Detroit. No. We would work it out. We would make sure its eliminated and no more subsidies for either one of those either any fossil fuel Biden said Ten Democrat candidates including Biden and Sanders will participate in the CNN hosted climate change town hall Wednesday evening.

The City of Lights Paris has been illuminated in recent days by cars set alight by thousands of protesting Yellow Vestslargely middle class people who earn their living by driving or who commute to get to work. The cause of their ire is a scheduled 25 cents per gallon increase in gas taxes and about 10 cents on diesel to fight climate change. French President Macron deeply unpopular just reversed course on the new green taxParisians are already paying about 7.06 per gallon for gasoline almost half of that in taxes. If Paris streets burned over a proposed25 cents per gallon climate change tax imagine the global conflagration over a 49 per gallon tax. Thats what a United Nations special climate report calls for in 12 years with a carbon tax of 5500 per tonequal to 49 per gallon of gasoline or diesel. Thats about 100 times todays average state and federal motor fuels tax. By 2100 the U.N. estimates that a carbon tax of 27000 per ton is needed240 per gallonto limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Of course that isnt going to happen. The economic wreckage of such a punitive tax would plunge the global economy into a permanent depressionand thats assuming politicians could enact such huge tax increases over the will of their voters. Keep in mind that the unrest in France was triggered by a looming 25 cent hike which is a little less than 10 more in taxes than French drivers already pay. To meet the 49 per gallon tax hike recommended by the U.N. fuel taxes in France would have to go up 17 fold. The violent protests in France were fueled by intense frustration felt by a middle class that sees itself squeezed. They dont earn enough to be part of the elite unconcerned with fuel taxes but they work hard enough that they dont qualify for the generous welfare benefits handed out to the nations poor and to newly arrived immigrants from Africa and the Middle East. Here in America Republicans in Congress passed a resolution against carbon taxes over the summer while Democrats embraced the concept in their party platform. Some incoming members of the new Democratic majority in the House are calling to create a select committee to map out a Green New Deal that would move the U.S. toward using 100 renewable energy for the electric grid while guaranteeing jobs for everyone. In the meantime opinion polls indicate that 54 of Americans do not believe global warming will cause major problems within their lifetimes. So how do climate activists get their way? Some openly talk of imposing authoritarian governance to override democratic institutions. Former NASA climate researcher James Hansen suggested in 2007 that the democratic process does not work. Other scientists have called the threat of global warming the equivalent of war while calling for the crushing of dissent and the jailing of deniers. Those who see climate change as a dire and urgent threat have some work to do to convince voters in the Western democracies to give up their way of life in exchange for unspecified benefits of a slightly less warm worldand thats assuming China India and over a billion people in Africa can be convinced not to try to pull themselves out of povertysomething that may only be done with greater use of fossil fuels. Thus one well worn tactic employed by those who would presume to tell the rest of us how to live where to live and how to workall of the good of the planet of courseis the alarmist study making copious use of lies of omission and commission. An example of the former can be seen in the new National Climate Assessment. The reports first chapter lists recent natural disasters citing this summers deadly Carr Fire in California as an example. But while the report seeks to link wildfire to climate change it glosses over the real reason fires have grown in intensity and size the 30 years of increased environmental restrictions on logging brush clearance and preventive burns that caused a massive and dangerous fuel buildupa problem that was predicted years ago and has nothing to do with global warming. The sin of commission in the service of scaring middle class voters into doing that theyre supposed to can be seen in an economic modeling study paid for by our federal tax dollars as well as underwritten by two billionaires who would be president Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg. Here were told that the U.S. economy will take a 10 hit by 2100 unless we reduce our carbon emissions. Two problems though the authors assume the worst case and least likely scenario with average temperatures more than 14 degrees Fahrenheit hotter by 2100 and they derive two thirds of their economic losses estimate by claiming a large amount of premature deaths due to the hotter temperatures. The latter claim is highly problematic as death rates in regions far hotter than in the U.S. arent meaningfully different when accounting for the standard of living. Why? People adapt rather easily. This makes for scary headlines in the New York Times or CNN but it is far from sound science or even good economics. The bottom line is this economic freedomthe kind you get with a large middle classleads to prosperity economic growth and technological innovation. And its these three things wealth growth and technology which allows humans to thrive on planet Earth not 240 per gallon fuel taxes imposed by an elite that cares not for the masses.
