Progressive political elites have decided that in order to save the environment ordinary citizens must submit to radical lifestyle changes while those same elites fly around the world on private jets and enrich themselves from trade with China the worlds biggest polluter. The reality may even be worse than the headline. Not only have progressive environmentalists suggested that we all switch to a diet of bugs instead of meat especially steak because cow farts produce carbon dontcha know one Swedish scientist even suggested we devour the flesh of deceased humansto cut greenhouse emissions. This followed an article published byNewsweek in which two psychologists mused on the human taboo against cannibalism noting thatphilosophers have argued that burying the dead could be wasteful in the context of the fight against world hunger. Cannibalism for the climate thats how far theyve gone! Population control is another solution embraced by geniuses on the left. This dystopian idea attracted attention recently after Bernie Sanders brought it up at the last Democrat presidential debate saying people need to be need to curb population growth. But Sanders was merely popularizing an idea thats long been the dream of progressive environmentalists. A 2009 study estimated that every human child will produce on average 9441 metric tons of carbon dioxide. As such climate scientists were agitating for global population control long before Bernie made his comments. Looks like China despite its pollution does have something to offer the environmental movement the one child policy! Absent from Bernies argument in favor of curbing the population was an acknowledgment of what itll do to the economy and public services two things that the socialist senator allegedly cares about. An aging populace with fewer young people producing tax revenue means a crisis for public services and a shrinking economy. Of course progressives believe in opening the wests borders to admit millions of working age people from foreign countries so maybe thats their solution. Dont forget that we all have to stop driving if we want to save the climate which means we all have to pack ourselves into dense unaffordable cities instead of living in the suburbs. As left wing environmentalists remind us suburban sprawl also contributes significantly to deforestation. But are there enough affordable homes in the cities? Well that depends on how you define a home. Is a recycled sewer pipe a home? The OPod Tube House is the latest solution imagined for young people who cant afford a real house or apartment in the city. These homes are constructed from recycled industrial piping and are designed to be stacked on top of each other. If that isnt enough of a dystopian cyberpunk nightmare for you consider parasite pods small homes designed to be attached to larger structures like skyscrapers and bridges. Theyre parasitic and we must credit the architectural students who came up with the concept for their refreshingly honest choice of name because they cling to larger structures. Are you ready to be a parasite for the environment? Fried insects for lunch in your parasite pod single occupancy of course. Cycle everywhere unless you want to face crippling carbon taxes. Drink your iced latte with a paper straw dont have kids and when you die remember to donate your human flesh to a local restaurant. Meanwhile our ruling class continues to fly to climate change summits on private jets own multiple CO2 emitting homes and advocate for unrestricted trade with pollution world champ China.

The Extinction Rebellion protesters arent helping their cause. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY warns the website of the Extinction Rebellion a group of climate change activists whose civil disobedience has included gluing themselves to a train and to Jeremy Corbyns fence nailing a pink boat to the ground in Oxford Circus pouring fake blood outside Downing Street holding a die in at Londons Natural History Museum and camping beneath the citys Marble Arch. What do they want? 1 For Britain to declare a climate and ecological emergency 2 for Britain to commit to net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2025 and 3 for a special climate change citizens assembly to decide future environmental policies. When do they want it? Now. We are now facing an existential crisis the climate crisis and ecological crisis which have never been treated as crises before they have been ignored for decades said Greta Thunberg a Swedish activist addressing London demonstrators. And for way too long the politicians and the people in power have gotten away with not doing anything. Now if Ms. Thunberg who is 16 years old had been addressing Chinese American or Indian protesters I might have had some sympathy. But to suggest that Britain has ignored climate change for decades is simply untrue. Since 1990 the country has achieved a 38 percent decrease in carbon dioxide emissions and has reduced its annual emissions by more than 43 percent this despite considerable economic growth. While the Paris Agreement sets the aim for net zero carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2050 and net zero greenhouse gases by 2070 Parliament in 2008 introduced the Climate Change Act which commits the United Kingdom to reducing its annual emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050. The U.K. has also removed coal as a major electricity source. I am sympathetic to the first of their aims making the environment a political priority and declaring climate change to be a global emergency. Scientists may not be infallible but Ive seen no credible argument for why they are all wrong in the same way. However much like Alexandria Ocasio Cortezs Green New Deal the demands of the Extinction Rebellion are risibly overreaching and counterproductive. In fact their demands could be realized only through an immediate economic overhaul by people who have yet to prove their competence. Recall the five goals set out in the Green New Deal as part of a ten year plan. First to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions while providing quality jobs for all. Second to guarantee millions of good high wage jobs and economic security. Third to invest and update industry and infrastructure. Fourth to secure healthy food and a livable climate for everyone. Fifth to end oppression and bring about the redistribution of power. Recall also the much criticized supporting FAQ materials produced by Ocasio Cortezs office. Embarrassing clauses about farting cows airplanes and those unwilling to work aside this document was illuminating because it showed that those who devised the Green New Deal have in practical terms no clue what they are doing. The same is true of the Extinction Rebellion. The entire spectacle has been highly disruptive for businesses and law enforcement alone. Im extremely concerned about the impact that the protests are having on our ability to tackle issues like violent crime if they continue any longer said Sadiq Khan Londons mayor who has estimated that around 9000 police officers have been dispatched to deal with the protesters. The police have made over 1000 arrests. Perhaps this frustration explains why Adam Boulton a presenter on Sky News told an Extinction Rebellion organizer Robin Boardman on live TV that the protesters come across as incompetent middle class self indulgent people trying to tell us how to live our lives. Instead of explaining why this perception is wrong Boardman insisted with his hand on his heart that he cared deeply before storming off the set. Yes Boulton was aggressive and accusatory but so are the tactics of the Extinction Rebellion.	False	True	False	True	True
A strong tsunami triggered by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake has hit a coastal Indonesian city officials say. Waves of up to 2m 6.6ft high swept through Palu on Sulawesi island not long after authorities had lifted a tsunami warning. Video on social media shows people screaming and fleeing in panic and a mosque amongst the buildings damaged. Officials have reported five deaths but it is not clear if those were as a result of the tsunami. Last month a series of earthquakes struck the Indonesian island of Lombok killing hundreds of people the biggest on 5 August killed more than 460. The earthquake hit just off central Sulawesi at a depth of 10km 6.2 miles just before 1800 1100 GMT the US Geological Survey said. A tsunami warning was issued but lifted within the hour. The dramatic video footage of the tsunami hitting Palu shows the high waves sweeping away several buildings and then the large tilted mosque in the town about 80km from the quake's epicentre. Dwikorita Karnawati head of Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency BMKG said the tsunami had receded. The situation is chaotic people are running on the streets and buildings collapsed. There is a ship washed ashore she added. The 2004 tsunami triggered by an earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra killed 226000 across the Indian Ocean including more than 120000 in Indonesia. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the Ring of Fire the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim. More than half of the world's active volcanoes above sea level are part of the ring.	False	True	False	True	True
Several high profile Democrats who back the so called Green New Deal are now apparently supporting a new report calling for a dramatic reduction in the worlds population to stave off a climate crisis. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey retweeted links to a report signed by more than 11000 scientists who argue that the population must be stabilizedand ideally gradually reducedwithin a framework that ensures social integrity. The report published Tuesday in the journal BioScience also calls for the wholesale dumping of fossil fuels and the emergence of green energy. They call for a bold and drastic change in economic growth to slash greenhouse gas emissions which research shows contributes to climate change. Ocasio Cortez a Democrat from New York backed the report on Twitter telling her followers in a Nov. 5 tweet that tweaks and shortcuts wont be enough to save the planet. The U.S. must engage in massive systemic change is in alignment with scientific consensus she said. The New York lawmaker retweeted a tweet from The Huffington Post that discusses the reports details. RELATED Ocasio Cortezs Chief Of Staff Admits What The Green New Deal Is Really About And Its Not The Climate Markey made similar comments. 11258 scientists are sounding the alarm we are in a climate emergency. And not just climate scientists. Biologists ecologists more the Massachusetts Democrat said in a Nov. 6 tweet. The crisis touches every aspect of our lives. So must the solution. Thats why we need a to fundamentally transform our society Markey added. He included in his tweet a link to a Washington Post report highlighting the nuts and bolts of the report. Markey and Ocasio Cortez introduced the GND in February which calls for a 10 year national mobilizations toward a series of goals designed to tackled global warming. The GND calls for the country to become carbon neutral within 10 years and seeks to aggressively reduce emissions. Other Democrats are also supporting the general thrust of Tuesdays report. Billionaire Tom Steyer also expressed his support. The world must wake up. We cant sweep climate change under the rug any longer Steyer said in a Wednesday tweet that also linked to WaPos report. World data consistently show that climate change is the least of most peoples concerns. Citizens generally are more concerned about getting a good education obtaining better healthcare and achieving political freedoms than they are tackling climate change according to a 2015 survey from the United Nations.

The Trump administration has repeatedly pointed to declines in U.S. carbon emissions to justify its fossil fuel focused energy dominance agenda. But a new analysis has delivered a blow to that defense concluding that the nations greenhouse gas emissions rose sharply in 2018. Emissions in the country jumped 3.4 percent last year the second largest annual increase in more than two decades according to a preliminary estimate by the economic research company Rhodium Group. The analysis comes on the heels of two gut wrenching climate reports one by the United Nations and another authored by scientists from more than a dozen federal agencies in the U.S. that warn the world is running out of time to stave off catastrophic and potentially irreversible climate change. The Trump administration continues to dismiss and downplay the crisis. I dont believe it President Donald Trump who has a long history of climate change denial said of his own administrations report. He added that were the cleanest weve ever been. Between 2005 and 2017 CO2 emissions in the U.S. fell by about 14 percent. Administration officials havetouted these declines to explain their push to boost fossil fuels as well as to defend the presidentsdecision last year to withdraw the U.S. from the historic Paris accord on combating climate change. We are moving forward but we are not moving forward in a detrimental impact to our economy as what the Paris climate accord would have called for Wheeler said. We are reducing our CO2 emissions faster than most other developed countries. We have our own plan. Were moving forward. Were addressing the issue. Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke who resigned Jan. 2 under a cloud of ethics scandals told the National Petroleum Council last month that the administrations regulatory philosophy is to partner with the fossil fuel sector which he said was at the leading edge of technology. The U.S. has lead the charge in cutting emissions of CO2 and methane a potent greenhouse gas he added. Everyone else is up he said referring to other countries overall emissions. Were going down while we have our record breaking oil and gas production. But as Rhodium Groups new analysis makes clear that was not the case in 2018. The emissions uptick the largest since the economic bounce back from the recession that ended in mid 2009 comes despite a record number of coal fired power plants going offline replaced largely by the use of natural gas. Along with an 1.9 percent spike in power sector emissions increases occurred in the transportation industry and buildings sectors according to Rhodium. Contributing to the overall increase were the growing U.S. economy a cold start to the year that required additional energy for heating and the limited progress made in developing decarbonization strategies the analysis found. With a new Congress in session we demand they heed these warnings about climate change and step up to act at the scale of the crisis she said in a statement. The administration has aggressively rolled back environmental and climate regulations including President Barack Obamas Clean Power Plan a policy limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. At Interior Zinke overturned an Obama era moratorium on new coal leases on federal land scrapped a hydraulic fracturing rule meant to better protect public health and curtailed a rule limiting the amount of methane that can be released from oil and gas operations on federal and Native American lands. Even amid the current partial government shutdown the administration has prioritized fossil fuels. The Interior Departmentone of the main agencies affected by the shutdown. is still issuing permits for oil companies according to Bloomberg. And the agency is continuing its push to open Alaskas fragile Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling holding public meetings as part of its ongoing environmental review process Alaska Public Media reported.

Democratic 2020 hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday released his plan for a Green New Deal promising that the multitrillion dollarplan to radically overhaul the economy and combat climate change will pay for itself over the next 15 years. As president Bernie Sanders will launch the decade of the Green New Deal a ten year nationwide mobilization centered around justice and equity during which climate change will be factored into virtually every area of policy from immigration to trade to foreign policy and beyond his campaign said in a press release. SANDERS CALLS FOR 'REGISTRY OF DISREPUTABLE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS' CUTTING PRISON POPULATION IN HALF The Vermont senator has long been an advocate for the Green New Deal but only this year has it become a central policy for many of those seeking the Democratic nomination for president. This year it was given a big push in Congress when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D N.Y. and Sen. Ed Markey D Mass. introduced a formal resolution on it which stalled in the Senate but drewsupport from a number of 2020 hopefuls. All versions of such plans have gone beyond direct energy related policies instead seeking to overhaul the economy and society at large. Sanders plan is no different promising that he will generate the political will necessary for a wholesale transformation of our society and proposing16.3 trillion in public investments. In addition to promises that include reaching 100 percent renewable energy by 2030 and decarbonization by 2050 and ending unemployment by creating 20 million good paying jobs tied to clean energy Sanders claims he will save families money with a host of policies including launching universal high speed Internet weatherizing homes building new public transportation and rebuilding Americas infrastructure. Among those promises are a 681 billion program for families and small businesses to trade in old vehicles for newer more energy efficient motors a souped up version of the Obama administration era Cash for Clunkers program. He also promises justice for frontline communities via a 40 billion Climate Justice Resiliency Fund as well as an extra 200 billion to the Green Climate Fund. The plan also promises support for the climate justice movement to take on the fossil fuel industry and other polluters and lead the globe in solving the climate crisis. In a nod to the social justice part of the plan he says that the deal is an opportunity to uproot historical injustices and inequities to advance social racial and economic justice including redressing the exclusion of black brown Native Americanand other vulnerable communities from the programs that made up the original New Deal. But the White House hopeful also promises that the plan will pay for itself over 16 years sayingexperts have scored the plan and its economic effects. According to the campaign revenue will be generated via a host of measures including slapping the fossil fuel industry with fees litigation and taxes and generating revenue from the sale of energy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Further sources of revenue or savings includetax revenue from the proposed 20 million jobs higher taxes on the wealthy lower military spending and a reduced need for welfare spending due to the creation of millions of good paying unionized jobs. Any such plan is unlikely to get any Republican support and would almost certainly rely entirely on Democrats having strong majorities in both the House and Senate should Sanders win the nomination and the presidency.

WASHINGTON Senator Bernie Sanders on Thursday release d a 16.3 trillion blueprint to fight climate change the latest and most expensive proposal from the field of Democratic presidential candidates aimed at reining in planet warming greenhouse gases. Mr. Sanders unveiled his proposal one day after Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington who made climate change the central focus of his campaign announced he was dropping out of the 2020 race. Mr. Inslees absence could create an opening for another presidential aspirant to seize the mantle of climate candidate. Mr. Sanders was an early supporter of the Green New Deal an ambitious but nonbinding congressional plan for tackling global warming and economic inequality. He is bestowing that same name upon his new plan which calls for the United States to eliminate fossil fuel use by 2050. It declares climate change a national emergency envisions building new solar wind and geothermal power sources across the country and commits 200 billion to help poor nations cope with climate change.

California legislators have voted to extend a centerpiece program to cut greenhouse gas emissions burnishing the states reputation as a bulwark against Donald Trumps demolition of climate change measures. In a rare show of bipartisan agreement on climate change eight Republicans joined with Democrats in Californias two legislative houses to extend the cap and trade emissions system a further 10 years until 2030. The emissions lowering scheme the second largest of its kind in the world aims to help the state reach its target of cutting planet warming gases 40 by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Tonight California stood tall and once again boldly confronted the existential threat of our time said Jerry Brown Californias governor. Republicans and Democrats set aside their differences came together and took courageous action. Thats what good government looks like. The cap and trade program established in 2006 under then governor Arnold Schwarzenegger sets a limit on emissions and requires polluters to either reduce their output or purchase permits from those who have. As the limit steadily becomes stricter it nudges businesses to take the more financially attractive option of cutting their pollution. California the sixth largest economy in the world is in stark opposition to Trumps administration. The president has said he will withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement and has set about dismantling federal policies that lower emissions. Brown has positioned himself as a countervailing force to Trump visiting China to talk to its leaders about climate change and promising to build and launch weather monitoring satellites should federal budget cuts endanger programs handled by Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOOA. A lot of you people are going to be alive and youre going to be alive in a horrible situation Brown told Californian lawmakers at a committee hearing shortly before the vote. This isnt for me Im going to be dead. This is for you and its real. Many Californian Republicans remain opposed to the cap and trade system warning it will pose a crushing blow to small businesses. But the bill ended up gaining an unusual level of Republican support with the extension also supported by key conservative constituencies including the California Chamber of Commerce and associations representing manufacturers and agriculture interests. Concessions to get some Republican support such as the limiting of separate regulations on refineries risked alienating more liberal Democrats. Some environmental groups including the Sierra Club attacked the bill for allowing polluters to continue emitting greenhouse gases if they offset them with green projects including those outside California. But other climate activists declared themselves pleased with the outcome pointing out that it showed that action to reduce emissions is bipartisan and popular. California is once again showing Washington DC and the rest of the world that fighting climate and air pollution is the right thing for our health economy and future said Fred Krupp president of the Environmental Defense Fund. Californias pioneering attitude to climate change action was underlined by separate court action launched on Monday aimed at holding fossil fuel companies accountable for global warming. Marin and San Mateo counties along with the City of Imperial Beach filed a lawsuit in the California superior court to complain that 37 oil gas and coal companies knew burning their products would increase carbon pollution and cause sea levels rise. Defendants have known for nearly 50 years that greenhouse gas pollution from their fossil fuel products has a significant impact on the Earths climate and sea levels the complaint states. The municipalities are claiming damages from the fossil fuel firms echoing a strategy used against the tobacco industry in the 1990s that resulted in multibillion dollar payouts. The companies targeted in the lawsuit include Shell Exxon Mobile Chevron and BP. According to the municipalities these businesses have caused around 20 of all industrial carbon dioxide and methane pollution since the 1960s.	True	False	False	False	True
President Donald Trump announced his decision to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord at 3 pm Eastern in the White House Rose Garden. A live stream of the announcement is embedded above. Multiple reports indicate that Trump is likely to announce a withdrawal from the agreement though many of these reports have expressed at least some uncertainty including about precisely what language Trump would use. Jonathan Swan of Axios reported that per two sources with direct knowledge of the decision Trump has decided to pull out of the agreement. The Daily Beasts Lachlan Markay reports that the White House is telling congressional staff that Trump will pull out. The Associated Presss Jill Colvin and Julie Pace though report that Trumps decision may not be entirely clear cut and that aides continued to deliberate on caveats in the language. The actual Paris deal agreed to by 195 countries in December 2015 is aspirational rather than binding calling on countries to set goals for emissions reduction. Still the withdrawal of the US would send an unmistakable signal to the rest of the world that the country with the second highest carbon emissions is no longer interested in even pretending to care about reducing them. For years now its been clear that blocking environmental regulations and obstructing action on climate change are top Republican Party priorities. The GOPs leading politicians and media outlets have tended to praise fossil fuel companies and ignore or cast doubt on climate science. The major Republican presidential candidates harshly criticized the Paris deal in particular and Trump promised to withdraw from it during the campaign. Still withdrawing from such a recent agreement that the vast majority of countries across the world have signed on to has serious consequences for Americas role as a global leader. So the question of whether the US should actually pull out of the agreement has reportedly been the subject of intense debate within the Trump administration. According to Politicos Andrew Restuccia and Josh Dawsey White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt have been the leading voices urging Trump to withdraw while Ivanka Trump and the so called New York or globalist White House camp have been advocating for staying in. Silicon Valley business leaders like Apple CEO Tim Cook and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have also been arguing that the US should stick to the agreement.	True	False	False	True	False
The Brando is one of the most luxurious eco resorts on the planet nestling on an atoll in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It's the last place you might think to find pioneering technology. But you'd be surprised. The Brando resort on Tetiaroa a stunning atoll north of Tahiti is the epitome of luxurious exclusivity. Two room bungalows start from 3700 3200 a night. Formerly owned by Hollywood legend Marlon Brando who was keen that it should become an ecological haven it has now developed in to a hideaway for the rich and famous seeking conscience soothing holidays that do less harm to the planet. While some have dismissed the resort as an island for liberal elites Beyonc and Barack Obama were recent guests current owner Richard Bailey claims it is close to becoming carbon neutral and self sustainable. Electricity at the complex for example is generated from solar panels and coconut oil biofuel while waste water is used for sustainable irrigation. And the resort's cooling system uses a closed loop heat exchanger that takes very cold sea water from 900m 2950ft below the surface of the Pacific Ocean to cool the fresh water and air circulating round the complex. As the cooling system is powered largely by water pressure it uses very little energy. It is often felt that sustainability is not compatible with the luxury end of the hospitality market but The Brando proves it is possible says Prof Graham Miller who holds a chair in sustainability in business at the University of Surrey. But of course visitors to The Brando have to fly to Tahiti first then take another 20 minute flight to paradise so their carbon footprint is still significant. The well heeled guests are unlikely to be bitten by mosquitoes either due to a sterilisation programme that has slashed Tetiaroa's mosquito population by at least 95. Led by Dr Herv Bossin of the Institut Louis Malard the programme breeds and releases non biting male mosquitoes infected with a Wolbachia virus that makes wild females who do bite sterile. Similar initiatives aimed at stamping out diseases such as Dengue and Zika are underway in countries such as Australia Colombia and China. But few countries have enjoyed the same level of success as Tetiaroa where mosquito levels are now so low the team is simply not catching any wild females anymore according to Frank Murphy executive director of the Tetiaroa Society the non governmental organisation NGO overseeing the sterilisation programme. The success of the project recently convinced the local government to fund a much larger breeding facility that could see the programme expand to other Pacific islands he says. Mosquitoes are not the only pests the Tetiaroa Society is working to eradicate. Rats are a big problem for the ecosystem of the atoll. Rats eat everything from baby turtles to sea birds and that is bad news for the coral reef too Mr Murphy says. Technology could help here too. The team wants to use 2.2m diameter drones to drop poisonous bait designed to attract rats but not other species. The operation only the second ever will be led by Island Conservation a US NGO that protects endangered species by removing invasive ones. Rats can cause the collapse of the entire terrestrial ecosystem says Island Conservation's Sally Esposito. In the past we have used helicopters to spread bait but we recently used drones for the first time on Seymour Norte in the Galapagos Islands. Tetiaroa is a more difficult environment so it's a great opportunity to test the drones further and should help us to create a haven for endangered native species such as the Polynesian Ground dove and the Tuamotu Sandpiper. Perhaps the most futuristic project on Tetiaroa is the Island Digital Ecosystem Avatar which uses light detection and ranging Lidar surveys to create a 3D model. Other data about animals plants topography and so on will be incorporated to create a model that could be used to predict how the island might react in different scenarios from flooding to the introduction of new species. The Lidar surveys give us a 3D representation of the physical contours of the island including the soils says Tetiaroa Society scientific director Neil Davies a senior fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science. It's a bit like putting the island through a scanner. The team's eventual aim is to capture the atoll's whole ecosystem from molecule upwards so it can help local governments and communities evaluate future risks and make better decisions. Eco tourism is a growing trend that resorts are seeking to exploit around the world as people seek to make more responsible choices in the face of climate change. For example the Parkside Hotel Spa in Canada along with The Brando is one of just a handful of resorts to attain the US Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design platinum certification. It has a 290 sq m 3000 sq ft vegetated roof and uses ponds and storm water storage tanks as a heat sink for its air conditioning system. And actor Leonardo DiCaprio a high profile environmental campaigner and The Brando regular is set to open his Blackadore Caye eco island resort off Belize in 2020. But with tourism contributing around 8 to global greenhouse gas emissions according to one recent paper published in the scientific journal Nature Climate Change all resorts will need to become carbon neutral not just those targeting the world's rich.

President Donald Trump set in motion a vast rollback of energy climate and environmental regulations during his first two years in office. Over the next two years those actions will face intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill. On Thursday Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives and the committees that conduct government oversight. Within the first few months of the year incoming committee chairs intend to hold a series of hearings to pick apart Trump's energy and environmental policies and what role industry insiders played in crafting them. The Trump administration has targeted dozens of rules. Some of the biggest items on its agenda include withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement expanding drilling on federal lands and watering down rules ranging from limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants to fuel efficiency in cars and trucks. Rep. Raul Grijalva the Arizona Democrat tipped to chair the House Natural Resources Committee says Americans can expect the committee to probe the financial costs and public health risks associated with Interior Department policies under Trump. Those include rolling back methane emissions rules from oil and gas operations and making virtually all federally administered offshore waters available to drillers. The Trump administration has spent two years giving away the store to fossil fuel companies and Republicans in Congress cheered every step of the way says Grijalva. We need to know what kind of impact this corporate favoritism is having on average Americans' health and quality of life.	True	True	False	True	True
Fans of Greta Thunberg have expressed relief after the 16 year old posted a string of smiling photographs on Instagram. The environmental activist's recent images taken while touring Canada's east coast in Montreal and Quebec are in sharp contrast to images of the 16 year old speaking in an emotionally charged appearance last month at the Climate Action Summit 2019 in New York. A photo of Greta scowling when she spotted Donald Trumpwent viral. The teenage campaigner who has 7.2million followers on Instagram looks decidedly happier since she crossed the border from the US something which her followers haven't failed to notice. Writing on Instagram Greta said 'So happy to say that the following weeks I'll travel slowly through the North American continent moving southwest and then eventually through South America towards Santiago. I will stop on the way and visit as many places as I can and of course protest every Friday no matter where I am.' Yesterday the teenager posted an image of herself at theMarine Mammal Interpretation Centre in Tadoussac Qubec after spending a morning watchingwhales. The tone of Greta's images have changed significantly since she addressed the United Nations Climate Summit on September 23rd where she came close to tears in a emotional speech to international delegates. She told them 'I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us for hope. How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words' During the same appearance Greta was seen at the UN headquarters with an enraged expression on her face as US President Donald Trump upstaged her entrance by walking in flanked by news reporters an image that promptly went viral. Among the comments posted by the environmentalist's followers many remarked how much happier the teenager had looked in recent days. On Instagram Jesuissuzette wrote 'Greta you look so much happier now that youre out of America. Enjoy your travels. And thank you for your intrepid Climate Crisis campaign.' Last week Thunberg addressed on social media the negativity she's received for speaking out on climate change saying 'Here we go again... As you may have noticed the haters are as active as ever going after me my looks my clothes my behaviour and my differences. They come up with every thinkable lie and conspiracy theory. It seems they will cross every possible line to avert the focus since they are so desperate not to talk about the climate and ecological crisis. Being different is not an illness and the current best available science is not opinions its facts.' Greta who is taking a sabbatical year from school arrived in North America in August taking a two week crossing on carbon neutral yacht Malizia II to address the United Nations. Greta Thunberg's fiery speech at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York This is all wrong. I shouldnt be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to me for hope? How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet Im one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you! For more than 30 years the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you are doing enough when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight. You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency. But no matter how sad and angry I am I dont want to believe that. Because if you fully understood the situation and still kept on failing to act then you would be evil. And I refuse to believe that. The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50 chance of staying below 1.5C degrees and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control. Maybe 50 is acceptable to you. But those numbers dont include tipping points most feedback loops additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution or the aspects of justice and equity. They also rely on my and my childrens generation sucking hundreds of billions of tonnes of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist. So a 50 risk is simply not acceptable to us we who have to live with the consequences. To have a 67 chance of staying below a 1.5C global temperature rise the best odds given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the world had 420 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide left to emit back on 1 January 2018. Today that figure is already down to less than 350 gigatonnes. How dare you pretend that this can be solved with business as usual and some technical solutions. With todays emissions levels that remaining CO2 budget will be entirely gone in less than eight and a half years. There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures today.

With the Democrats ascension to power in the Commonwealth of Virginia following the November 2019 elections the state can expect the new legislature to try and push an aggressively progressive agenda. But you may be surprised just how progressive it is. The Democrats flipped control of the state senate from a 20 19 Republican majority to a 21 19 Democratic majority. They also regained control of the state House of Delegates turning a 51 49 Republican majority into a 55 45 Democratic majority. According to the Washington Post this is the first time in 25 years that Democrats have controlled every lever of state power. Lets take a look at how they intend to use it. Here are some of the most radical bills Democrats have introduced in the statehouse. RELATED Democrats Take Control Of Virginia State Legislature For The First Time In Decades HB 77 unanimously endorsed by the Democratic party in Virginia as part of their pre election platform calls for radical action from the Virginian government in order to address climate change. This bill introduced by Delegate Sam Rasoul states that by 2036 essentially all energy sold must come from clean energy sources. The bill reads in calendar year 2036 and every calendar year thereafter 100 percent of the electricity sold by a retail electric supplier is required to be generated from clean energy resources. The clean energy mandates apply to a public utility or other person that sells not less than 1000 megawatt hours of electric energy to retail customers or generates not less than 1000 megawatt hours of electric energy for use by the person. HB 77 also calls for job training for those workers displaced by the transition to renewable energy sources. Additionally the Democratic majority will allow Northam to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative RGGI. The RGGI is described as the first mandatory market based program in the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nine states are currently members. Permitting 16 year old children to obtain abortions without parental consent is also on the docket for Virginian Democrats. Senate Bill No. 21 states that A minor shall be deemed an adult for the purpose of consenting to Medical or health services related to abortion birth control pregnancy or family planning except for the purposes of sexual sterilization. Prior to this bill Virginia Code 16.1 241 required minors to have the permission of a guardian before having an abortion. If the minor wasnt able to obtain permission then they had to seek judicial authorization during which a judge would determine if the abortion was in the minors best interests and that they were mature enough to make that decision. Tanning is now apparently too dangerous to be done by anyone under the age of 18. This bill bans the use of tanning facility by any person under the age of 18 among other restrictions and does not carve out a parental consent exception. Section G of House Bill No. 38 says No individual under the age of 18 shall be allowed to use any tanning device at a tanning facility. The owner shall be responsible for ensuring that each customer using the tanning facility is of legal age to do so. HB 145 mandates that the Virginia Department of Education come up with school board model policies concerning the treatment of transgender students in public elementary and secondary schools that address common issues regarding transgender students in accordance with evidence based best practices. The bill goes on to describe several areas for this guidance. Some of the proposed specifics are harmless such as section 3 which says that the developed policies should prevent and respond to bullying and harassment. However section 8 calls for standards in accordance with evidence based best practices regarding Student participation in sex specific school activities events and athletics and use of school facilities which can be read as including male female transgender students being included in female specific restrooms facilities and sports. It also calls for guidance regarding the identification of students and compliance with applicable nondiscrimination laws which would include the Equality Act if passed by Congress a big legislative priority of congressionalDdemocrats. If HB 41 passes then board licensed primary care physicians will be required to discuss the potential negative effects of adverse childhood experiences on both mental and physical health during a patients first visit. Doctors will also have to screen patients for adverse childhood experiences that may impact a patients physical or mental health or the provision of health care services to the patient. Gun control is perhaps the most widely known and publicized issue of the 2019 election. Following a shooting in Virginia Beach in June Northam called a special session of the legislature in order to address gun violence. Republicans adjourned the session after 90 minutes. The governor has announced that gun control measures will be reintroduced in January. SB 16 states that it is unlawful for anyone to manufacture purchase possess or transport an assault firearm. A violation of this section is punishable as a Class 6 felony. An assault weapon is defined as The bill furthers prohibits handguns with a fixed magazine capacity in excess of 10 rounds and semi automatic shotguns that has a a fixed magazine capacity in excess of seven rounds among other commonly found features. If the bill passes as it currently stands even current owners of these firearms would face criminalization for what were previously legally owned firearms. RELATED Ocasio Cortezs Chief Of Staff Admits What The Green New Deal Is Really About And Its Not The Climate Virginians can expect a wave of progressive legislation to hit their state over the next several years as the Democrats enjoy having control of the state government. However some push back from state residents might be stronger than expected as the anticipated assault weapons ban has caused 94 counties to declare themselves second amendment sanctuaries. It remains to be seen if any other of the other proposed bills will spark as intense a reaction.	False	True	False	True	False
The 2015 Paris agreement's ambitious goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C remains within reach a study suggests. The study is one of several to address the carbon budget which among other things determines how much CO2 the planet can emit and still reach a given limit for global warming. It indicates the 2015 target perceived by some as tough could be met with very stringent emissions cuts. It used computer models that project climate behaviour into the future. The aim of the Paris deal was holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2C above pre industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5C. But scientists admit they were taken by surprise by the ambition of the 1.5C figure. The results of the work with computer models have been published in Nature Geoscience. This type of work necessarily contains uncertainties regarding the way the Earth's climate will respond in future and how quickly societies can move away from fossil fuel use. But the study authors say Pursuing 'efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C' is not chasing a geophysical impossibility. Co author Michael Grubb from University College London said This paper shows that the Paris goals are within reach but clarifies what the commitment to 'pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C' really implies. Those commitments would require strengthening the nationally determined contributions NDCs the pledges to cut emissions contained in the Paris agreement. Previous estimates of the remaining 1.5C carbon budget based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's IPCC Fifth Assessment of the climate were around four times lower. But unlike those figures which relied on one line of evidence the new study uses multiple approaches to examine the question and comes up with a rather different result. Co author Prof Pierre Friedlingstein from the University of Exeter said This is very good news for the achievability of the Paris targets. Prof Myles Allen another author from the University of Oxford told BBC News In the main body of the IPCC assessment what it would take to meet a 1.5C goal wasn't assessed in any detail. To be honest it wasn't thought to be the policy priority at the time. Perhaps it should have been but that was the view of the academic community then. But the ambition of Paris caught a lot of people by surprise. The climate models are exaggerating. The predictions are too alarmist. The Tuvaluans and other islanders are safer than we thought. These are among the conclusions that some might reach from this latest work. In reality nothing is quite that straightforward. The models are simulated approximations of possible futures. Inevitably they are going to be at least slightly adrift of reality either in the amount of warming or its timing. They come with caveats and margins of error. In many ways it's remarkable that these computer constructs are even roughly on track. And models designed to come up with very broad potential outcomes for the end of the century may not be fine tuned enough to give more detailed forecasts year by year. The authors themselves are anxious that their research is not misunderstood. The need for urgent action to reduce emissions is unchanged they say. It's just that the most ambitious of the Paris Agreement targets is not as unachievable as many once thought that there is time to act though the task remains a monumental one. Myles Allen added For a two in three chance of keeping temperatures within 1.5C we'd have to reduce emissions in a straight line to zero from where we are now over the next 40 years. It's possible but extremely challenging. So if people are saying can we now relax? That's not the right message to take at all. Scientists agree urgent action will be needed to tackle the effects of rapid temperature increase over the next century. But a study earlier this year suggested the allowable carbon budget had probably been overestimated. It said the pre industrial baseline used to benchmark present day warming was probably older than the IPCC had assumed. Therefore the degree of warming since that baseline was probably greater than had been believed. On Twitter one of the authors of that report Prof Michael Mann said the latest research in Nature Geoscience doesn't account for the pre industrial baseline issue we examined. He added There is some debate about the precise amount of committed warming if we cease emitting carbon immediately. We're probably very close to 1.5C. Meanwhile another study in Nature Geoscience by Gunnar Myhre from the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo and colleagues suggests the greenhouse effect caused by human induced CO2 emissions is now half way to doubling compared with pre industrial conditions. Although the concentrations themselves have not yet reached the halfway mark this is being described as an iconic watermark.	False	True	False	True	True
California and 16 other states sued the Trump administration Tuesday over its plan to scrap Obama era auto emissions standards that would require vehicles to get significantly higher gas mileage by 2025. At issue is a move by Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt to roll back 2012 rules aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Under those rules vehicles would have to get 36 miles of real world driving per gallon about 10 miles over the existing standard. Pollutants coming out of vehicles out of the tailpipe does permanent lung damage to children living near well traveled roads and freeways. This is a fact. The only way we're going to overcome that is by reducing emissions Gov. Jerry Brown said in announcing the lawsuit along with other top California Democrats. The rules were set six years ago when California and the Obama administration agreed to a single nationwide fuel economy standard. Pruitt who has sought to block or delay an array of environmental regulations has argued that assumptions about gas prices and vehicle technology used by the Obama administration to set the standards were too optimistic. And he said the standards would hurt automakers and consumers who can't afford or don't want to buy more fuel efficient vehicles. Automakers have likewise argued that the Obama era rules would cost the industry billions of dollars and raise vehicle prices because of the cost of developing the necessary technology. EPA representatives did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the lawsuit. California officials say the standards are achievable and the EPA's effort to repeal them is not based on any new research. They argue the plan violates the federal Clean Air Act and didn't follow the agency's own regulations. California has a unique waiver that allows it to set its own tailpipe emissions standards for vehicles which it has used to combat smog and more recently global warming. Thirteen other states and the District of Columbia have adopted the California standards as their own. California has now sued the Trump administration more than 30 times on topics including immigration and health care policy. The world is not flat pollution is not free and the health and safety of our children is not for sale said Democratic state Attorney General Xavier Becerra standing alongside the governor. Brown who has made fighting climate change a core of his policy and political platform said the state's battles with Washington over climate are the most essential. If we follow the Pruitt Trump path we follow our way off the cliff to disaster he said. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Joining California were Connecticut Delaware Illinois Iowa Maine Maryland Minnesota New Jersey New York Oregon Rhode Island Vermont Washington Massachusetts Pennsylvania Virginia and the District of Columbia. All have Democratic attorneys general.	True	True	True	True	False
WASHINGTON The Trump administration is moving forward with a significant rollback of an Obama era cleanwater regulation that has become a rallying cry for farmers and property rights activists opposed to federal overreach. The new proposal unveiled Tuesday morning by actingEPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler and other administration officials wouldease Washington's oversight of small bodies of water undoing a regulationPresident Donald Trump has called a massive power grab. The new rule wouldreplace an Obama administration regulation known as the Waters of the United States rulethat expandedfederal protections to smaller rivers and streams. Environmental advocates warn the proposed rule could remove pollution and development protections from mostU.S. waterways and pose far reaching effects on the safety of the nation's tap water for more than 100 million Americans. Even a child understands that small streams flow into large streams and lakes which provide drinking water for so many Americans said Craig Cox senior vice president for agriculture and natural resources for the EnvironmentalWorking Group. By removing safeguards and allowing industry to dump pollutants into these water sources Trumps EPA is ensuring more contamination challenges for utilities and dirtier water for their customers. But opponents of the Obama era WOTUS rule say it unduly prevents property owners from being able to fully use their land because the rule's overly broad definition regulates ditches that temporarily flood as federally protected waterways. The old rule put Washington in control of ponds puddles and prairie potholes saidWyoming GOP Sen.Tom Barrasso who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee. The regulation was so confusing that property owners and businesses could not determine when permits were needed. The crux of the rollback is a change in how navigable waterways are defined under the Clean Water Act. The 2015 definition crafted under President Barack Obama would narrow considerably under Trump a move that Wheeler told reporters wouldmake it clearer and easier to understand ... that will result in significant cost savings protect the nation's navigable waterways and reduce barriers to important economic and environmental projects. Wheeler cited the Missouri Farm Bureauwhich launched a Ditch the Rule campaign opposing the 2015 proposal because it was concerned theObama era definition was so broad it could apply to almost every acre in the state. The Obama administration claimed it was in the interest of water quality but it was really about power power in the hands of the federal government over landowners Wheeler said. It's also confusing because the rule is enforced in only 22 statesthe District of Columbia and the U.S. territories. Under Trump's proposedrule federal protections would remain for major waterways riverstributaries wetlands adjacent to federally protected waterways certain lakes and ponds reservoirs and ditches used for navigation or affected by the tide. States would overseemost ditches terrain that fills with water during or in response to rainfall certain wetlands that have been used to grow crops stormwater control ponds and water and wastewater treatment systems. Additionally groundwater would not be federally protected an exclusion Wheeler said that was never supposed to be included. Wheeler disputed claims by environmental groups that the rule would remove federal oversightfrom at least 60 percent of the nation's waterways. But EPA officials also could not say what percentage would lose those protections. Delaware Sen. Tom Carper the top Democrat on the Environment and PublicWorks Committee said the rollback would send the country back to a time when environmental protections were few and far between. Back then the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland Ohio was so polluted that it actually caught on fire. Polluters were allowed to dump toxic waste into our waterways without consequence. Garbage littered our shores Carper said. It isnt just a coincidence that this is no longer the reality in our country. In one of his first acts as presidentTrump signed an executive order in February 2017 to undo the clean water rule and instructed the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to come up with a new approach. In a Roosevelt Room ceremony with farmers and lawmakers at the time Trump called the rule one of the worst examples of federal regulation. The debate over the water rule was part of a larger political flashpoint over environmental issues during the 2016 presidential campaign as Trump tried to appeal to rural Americans exasperated by federal regulations and the loss of property rights. While the broader debate centered on climate change and clean air rules the waters rule was nearly as polarizing because its broad application could affect farming construction and other activities near federally regulated waters. The issue has often come down to the definition of navigable waters under the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act of 1972 makes it illegal to pollute navigable waters. Over the decades disputes arose over the government's changing definition of navigable with opponents complainingthe definition was too broad. Two Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 came down on the side of landowners ruling that ponds at the bottom of a gravel pit and a marsh miles from any lake or river were not navigable and thus not subject to the act. Wheeler said he wants the rule to reflect the court rulings.

As thousands of activists and scientists around the world gather to March for Science Bill Nye has a U.S. Constitution lesson for Donald Trump that proves he must advance scientific causes. In an interview on MSNBCs AM Joy Nye said that it explicitly states in the Constitution that the U.S. government must promote the progress of science and useful arts something the Trump administration isnt even close to upholding. Nye had a reminder for the Trump administration I just want to remind the administration that science is political. It is inherently political like everything else Its in the U.S. Constitution Article 1 Section 8 to promote the progress of science and useful arts. And my interpretationof the expression useful arts is engineering. In those days it would be architecture city planning designing of the drainage systems sewage systems and communications systems. This is all in the U.S. Constitution Thats what enables innovation and if our country stops innovating it will not be able to compete worldwide. Nye said that solutions to battling climate change are realistic and doable if the United States simply puts resources toward the effort and decides to act. We could get to 80 percent renewables in the next 15 years we could 100 percent renewable in the next 30 years and we wouldnt have to have a military on the other side of the world protecting oil fields so that we could get our fossil fuels here in North America he said. Once again the biggest hurdle in battling climate change isnt the existence of feasible solutions those already exist. The problem at least in the United States is Republicans in Congress and now the White House especially Trump who believes climates change is a hoax who continue to deny that the climate crisis is happening in the first place despite the overwhelming evidence. Donald Trump isnt just shirking his constitutional responsibility to advance scientific innovation but hesputting at risk the only planet we have.	True	True	False	True	False
The twin disasters of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma showcased once again the media's reflex to use such tragedies to push for liberal climate change policies. In their pursuit of this agenda the broadcast networks' have heavily criticized the Trump administration's policies on the environment. From January 20 through August 31 MRC analysts tallied 75 stories discussing the President and climate change totaling 73 minutes 43 seconds of network airtime. The commentary in these stories was as one sided as the rest of Trump's coverage has been with 88 percent of evaluative statements criticizing the President vs. a mere 12 percent that praised him. Methodology Our measure of spin was designed to isolate the networks own slant not the back and forth of partisan politics. Thus our analysts ignored soundbites which merely showcased the traditional party line Republicans supporting Trump Democrats criticizing him and instead tallied evaluative statements which imparted a clear positive or negative tone to the story such as statements from experts presented as non partisan voters or opinionated statements from the networks own reporters. Using these criteria MRC analysts tallied 121 evaluative statements about the Trump administrations approach to the environment from January 20 to August 31 2017 of which 106 88 were negative vs. a mere 15 12 which were positive. This study does not look at all climate change related stories during this time frame. Instead it covers specifically the coverage of President Trumps environmental agenda on ABC World News Tonight CBS Evening News and NBC Nightly News. The most consistent factor in all of this coverage was the criticism. NBC Nightly News correspondent Matt Bradleys July 30 quip that President Donald Trump shifts American climate commitments into reverse was typical of the media attitude towards the presidents environmental policies. On June 2 Nightly News correspondent Kristen Welker promoted an anti Trump protest over this decision hyping the backlash is only heating up. The same night CBS Evening Newss anchor Anthony Mason spoke of the world of opposition to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Correspondent Chip Reid echoed by referencing worldwide condemnation. NBC Nightly News anchor Savannah Guthrie on June 1 criticized the move to withdraw from the climate treaty detractors say it is a stunning abandonment of the U.S.s leadership in the world and a grave threat to the planet itself. To their credit CBS stood alone in interviewing a conservative to hear the other side of the climate change debate. On April 22 CBS Evening News correspondent Dean Reynolds noted that Joe Bast CEO of The Heartland Institute looks with approval on Mr. Trumps decision to roll back regulations limiting greenhouse gases and to his appointments of fellow skeptics in the administration. Climate change he Bast says is a naturally occurring cyclical phenomenon caused mostly by the sun not an approaching disaster accelerated by carbon dioxide emissions caused by humans. However before stating this position Reynolds noted that most climate scientists the United Nations as well as NASA dismiss these arguments as propaganda for fossil fuels. On March 28 NBC Nightly News profiled celebrations in coal country over Trumps environmental proposals mentioning a barber shop in West Virginia where they cheered the move hoping it will bring back jobs. Afterwards correspondent Kristen Welker noted that federal data shows mines have been losing jobs for decades under both parties. Right now there are less than seventy five thousand coal jobs compared to more than six hundred and fifty thousand in renewable energy which can be less expensive to produce.

The following post written by The Rev. Robert A. Franek is a part of Politicus Policy Discussion in which writers draw connections between real lives and public policy. Amid the billowing smoke of the Trump Russia scandal both Donald Trump and the Republicans in Congress have found time to further their agenda of stripping the civil rights away from LGBT people taking healthcare away from women and assuring that scientific data be kept away from the Environmental Protection Agency. Each of these is an outrageous moral failure. Each is a step backward in our nations progress towards greater equality for all. And each is a threat to the life liberty and pursuit of happiness guaranteed to every person. While the present civil rights challenge for LGBT people persists and the funding for Planned Parenthood hangs in the balance the damage being done to our environment through toxic pollution of water systems and neglecting climate change realities even to the omission of scientific data will be much harder to restore with a new administration and Congressional priorities. The Trump Russia scandal smoke will eventually clear but the carbon dioxide billowing into the atmosphere is doing permanent damage. More the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines present real threats to land and waterways for millions of people. Rolling back environmental protection regulations and willful denying of scientific data to forestall efforts to fight climate change is a direct threat to each persons right to life liberty and pursuit of happiness. When the air we breathe and the water we drink are imminently threatened so that corporations can make more money life liberty and the pursuit of happiness are on the line. It would seem that these fundamental freedoms would be something especially Republicans would want to defend in the cause of patriotic duty. However as the Trump Russia scandal has proven time and again there is no limit as to the Republicans will to put party over the good of the country. The threats to life because of environmental deregulation and not addressing climate change are more than theoretical. All kinds of illnesses are on the rise and can be traced to chemicals in air and water. Storms are becoming more and more severe causing greater damage homes businesses and entire communities. And still repugnant Republicans put profits over people and stupid over scientific data. Without a habitable environment that is safe from toxic waste harmful chemicals and dangerous carbon dioxide emissions leading to an ever warming planet how can anyone be assured of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness? When the environment poses an unnecessary threat to ones health life is denied. One might expect the so called party of life to be concerned about this. But one would be grossly mistaken. If there was any care for life beyond birth they would not be stripping rights away from LGBT people or denying women access to healthcare much less actively working to endanger and destroy the necessities for life air and water. Amid the Trump Russia scandal and the smoke that continues to billow around the White House and Congressional Republicans we must not lose sight of the actual smoke and pollution destroying our planetary ecosystems that sustain life for us and all creation. Securing the long term future of civil rights for LGBT people womens access to heath care and the flourishing of our environment that we may all enjoy life liberty and the pursuit of happiness rests not only on getting to the bottom of the Trump Russia scandal and draining the swamp in his administration along with the scandal covering right denying profit seeking in Congress but also on preventing the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Assuring that all have life liberty and the pursuit of happiness is a fundamental moral commitment that we share as citizens working together for the common good of all people and the whole creation.

First it was global warming andor global cooling. Then when they figured out that they couldnt accurately predict which way it was going to go they settled on climate change. Apparently that phrase just doesnt have the oomph it once did and the church of climate change wants to rebrand their apocalypse to make people far more scared and subsequently obedient. An article by Aaron Hall in AdAge asked the question of whether or not people will be more apt to fall in line with the climate alarmists if they take out the neutral sounding climate change and replace it with something you might hear Chicken Little screaming Scientific terms often fail to resonate in meaningful ways. In the early 1900s for example no one had heard of the hypothesis of the primeval atom. That changed in the 1940s when the term Big Bang was coined which was a simpler more relatable concept for the masses. This complex scientific concept is extremely well known today because a better more tangible term was applied to it. Can we use lessons from the naming of the Big Bang to rebrand climate change? Interestingly Hall notes that politicians liked global warming because it sounded dynamic and scary but since it was too easy to poke holes in they decided to move on to climate change. People began joking about wanting global warming whenever it got too cold outside and the politicians much like the devil himself cant stand it when people laugh at them. Hall being a professional namer wondered allowed about whether or not people would take the church of climate change more seriously if he renamed it to sound scarier. He said that the new name needs to appeal to people who are unscientific to help them understand the severity of the problem and inspire them to make more eco friendly life choices and pro climate choices at the ballot box. In other words it needs to scare people into voting Democrat. What did his team of global namers come up with? A bunch of names that sound like bad B Movie titles. These options are subtle brand shifts from global warming yet they deliver a more negative image. The names signal that ice caps are melting but also create a more visceral image in the mind that real feeling of melting when its too hot outside. A meltdown is a disastrous event that draws from the ultimate terror of a nuclear meltdown an apt metaphor for global destruction. In naming we call metaphorical names suggestive names and they are one of the most popular types of names. Good brand names instill a clear message or even a direct call to action. Perhaps thats why climate change isnt powerful enough Change sounds so neutral. However theres nothing neutral about collapse or chaos. Both are states of events that you absolutely want to avoid. They ask each of us to do what it takes to avoid collapsing or descending into chaos. They both also use alliteration using the same letter or sound at the beginning of connected words a naming trick proven to enhance memorability. Arresting brand names often capitalize on vivid visual associations. They refer to a tipping point that were catapulting toward and must find a way to avert. Because a boiling point is the point at which liquid vaporizes it brings forth imagery of rivers lakes and oceans boiling and disappearing. Melting Point paints a clear picture of solid matter melting. As glaciers melt and disappear so does our way of life. Its time to take the gloves off and stop pretending. Sometimes a brand name needs to be hyperbolic to truly capture hearts and minds. If we dont take massive action now Earth will be uninhabitable an irreversible barren wasteland. Plants and animals will die. Humans wont be able to survive extreme weather like floods droughts and fires. If we dont change we wont even be able to spend time outside. Scorched Earth paints the direst picture of whats to come and what we must avoid and is likely the edgiest brand name from our exploration. Those were just the winners. Hall gives an honorable mention to these as well Emission Critical Focuses on the action we need to take reducing emissions. Pre Extinction Powerful and suggests another mass extinction is imminent if we do not change our ways today. The Great Collapse The collapse of ecosystems economies and our way of life. Earthshattering Creatively arresting the complete destruction of the Earth as we know it. Whats the takeaway from all this? Not that climate change is going to end the world. Its not. No real scientific data points to that fact. The takeaway here is that there are actually people out there trying to worry you into obedience and support for a leftist agenda and in order to do that theyre willing to play with your brain by changing up the words they use. As you see above Hall even admits that theyre willing to get hyperbolic in order to make you scared.	False	False	False	True	True
Statements from activists and politicians linking natural disasters to man made global warming are almost always false according to a book debunking misinformation about climate science. The newest version of the book The Rightful Place of Science Disasters Climate Change by University of Colorado professor Roger Pielke Jr. takes on the often false claims peddled in the media about global warming and disasters from hurricanes to floods to droughts. Every time there is a disaster politicians journalists and scientists unfailingly spring to life to tell us that the disaster and the costs and suffering that accompanied it were associated with linked to or even caused by climate change Pielke wrote in his newly updated book. Such statements as Ill show in this book are almost always false he wrote. While no skeptic of man made warming Pielke painstakingly goes through peer reviewed scientific assessments separating the science from the media spin when it comes to natural disasters.RELATED Dan Rather Claims That Global Warming Rarely Tops The Headlines. Is That True? Pielkes motivation in releasing an updated version of his book initially published in 2014 was he saw the issue of extreme weather become politicized. Now journalists and politicians are tying every weather event to man made warming despite the lack of scientific evidence. For example The New Republics Emily Atkinrecently calledfor journalists to put every weather event in the context of global warming. Her call even got a reaction from NPR which defended its reporting but was sympathetic to her message. Popular figures like Bill Nye the Science Guy and former Vice President Al Gore routinely link natural disasters to global warming. California Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown blamed the intense wildfires in his state on a new normal from a warming climate. But the most thorough scientific assessments show no increasing trends in global frequency or intensity for many types of disasters including hurricanes floods droughts and wildfires. While political spin doctors often find ways to parse language and statistics to say things that are plausibly defensible but which are ultimately misleading or just wrong for me such misrepresentations have gone too far in an area where I have some considerable expertise Pielke wrote. The willingness of some in the media and the scientific community to offer false or misleading claims does not offer a route to scientific integrity Pielke wrote. Pielke gives many examples of this including The New York Times hyping of the National Climate Assessment NCA special report released in 2017. The Times claimed the NCA showed how every part of the country has been touched by warming from droughts in the Southeast to flooding in the Midwest to a worrying rise in air and ground temperatures in Alaska and conditions will continue to worsen. The article went on to quote Penn State Universitys Michael Mann to bolster its claim. But Pielke was quick to point how the NCAdid not supportThe Times sweeping claims about warming. Anyone claiming that new US climate report supports attributing trends in extremes to human causes is just wrong Pielke said at the time. However Pielke has paid a price for pointing out inconvenient truths about extreme weather and global warming. Pielkes career beentargetedby Democratic lawmakers and activist journalists to impress a billionaire donor. This stance has ultimately led me to being systematically attacked any time I make a public statement about climate change in effect railroading me out of the climate debate as an unwelcome voice Pielke wrote. While this is often extremely frustrating I remain committed to doing the best job I can analyzing data on climate and disasters in ways that are transparent and grounded in evidence.

An upstate New York local official has promised no quarter in his towns battle against a planned wind power farm thathasDemocratic Gov. Andrew Cuomos support. Yates town councilman John Riggi opposes Apex Clean Energys plan to build a 200 megawatt wind turbine project over the objections of local officials and a majority of voters. Riggi says hes not opposed to green energy but doesnt want it nearby if his constituents dont support it. He wrote an editorial in a local paper this week pledging to accept no quarter in the fight against the Lighthouse Wind farm. The main concern is the desires of the constituency who are massively opposed to this project Riggi told The Daily Caller New Foundation. It is like 87 percent opposed. Cuomo plans to drastically increase New Yorks wind power capacity as part of his effort to phase out fossil fuels. Cuomo wants New York to get 50 percent of its electricity from green energy source by 2030. Cuomodid not return requests for comment to TheDCNF. Some of these turbines would be 750 feet high Riggi said. They want to put 70 of them in a 24 square mile area. It would completely change the community into something very different from how it feels Riggi said. People live here because they like rural living. They dont want their areas turned into industrialized zones. Lighthouse Wind could also run into opposition from environmentalists who are increasingly turning against wind power at the local level. Environmentalists have become concerned with wind powers impact on birds and bats. Wind farms kill an estimated 573000 birds and 888000 bats a year according to a 2013 peer reviewed study published in Wildlife Society Bulletin. Wind farms are projected to kill 1.4 million birds annually by 2030. This area sits astride the preeminent bird and avian flyway on the North American continent Riggi said. We have birds coming in massive amounts. Theres an issue with that. Its a danger to the birds and bats. Wind farms kill an estimated 573000 birds each year as well as888000 bats according to a 2013 peer reviewed study published inWildlife Society Bulletin.Wind farms are projected to kill1.4 million birds annuallyby 2030. Apex Clean Energy also works to ensure that our projects are responsibly sited for wildlife by conducting in depth environmental impact studies for every project Cat Strumlauf a spokesperson for Apex told TheDCNF. At every stage of development and operation we coordinate with federal and state wildlife agencies to make sure that our projects are sited in areas where impacts to birds or bats are minimized and appropriately mitigated if necessary. The projectcould harm with the regions economy potentially creating problems fora nearbyU.S. Air Force base. We also have an Air Force base 30 miles from the proposed project site Riggi said. The base is concerned about the wind project because it would mess with the radar. We have an aerial refueling and drone mission there. It could impact how theyre performing as well. The wind farm could make a nearby military base which is a critical part of the local economy much less useful. The base pump 200 million a year into the region and employs over 2600 people. Apex Clean Energy takes the safety and readiness of our military very seriously and we work closely with the Department of Defense and its services to ensure our wind energy facilities do not adversely impact military missions Strumlauf said. Riggi is also worried about the health concerns involving wind turbines. One of most common complaints about wind turbines by local residents is that they cause flickering when the sun is behind their blades. This is generally agreed to be incredibly annoying and theres evidence that it can cause headaches sleep disorders anxiety and depression symptoms in people who live nearby. Finally Riggi is concernedCuomos green goals give local governments very little flexibility to determine how they go green. One of the thing the governor is very clear on is that he wants all towns to become more green Riggi told TheDCNF. What I dont understand is with all of this going on why would the governor not allow the towns to choose how theyll support this initiative. Theres no flexibility. New York state currently gets less than 5 percent of its electricity from wind and solar according to the Energy Information AdministrationEIA. Thats a long way from Cuomos 50 percent by 2030 target. Do we want to reduce our carbon footprint? Riggi said. Certainly. But were not being given the option of deciding how to do it ourselves. Were full in on renewable energy but the town wants to have a choice. We want to be the ones to make the decisions on how were going to contribute.

Most of the threats from climate change are 50 to 75 years out Wheeler asserted adding that the world should be focused on the people who are dying today the thousand children that die every day from lack of drinking water. Lets put aside the fact that climate change is not some distant challenge but one already wreaking havoc on communities around the globe and that Wheeler has proposed gutting existing regulations that protect drinking water. Its absurd to act like planetary warming isnt a significant threat to the worlds freshwater resources. Its the biggest threat of all. Climate change is a multiplier. Very few of the problems that we have right now related to water are going to be made better by climate change. Thats not going to happen. Theres no denying the magnitude of the water crisis in the U.S. and abroad. Droughts which are made worse by climate change lead towater shortages while inland and coastal flooding can contaminate drinking water supplies. Under the current climate change scenario nearly half the global population will be living in areas of high water stress by 2030 according to the United Nations which warns that water is the primary medium through which we will feel the effects of climate change. Last years Fourth National Climate Assessment the work of hundreds of scientists at more than a dozen federal agencies including the EPA documents significant changes in water quality and quantity across the country and warns that water security in the United States is increasingly in jeopardy. The report details how rising temperatures and variable precipitation can have cascading effects on water quality increasing the risk of drought pollutant runoff and harmful algal blooms. Climate change is a multiplier Caldas said. Very few of the problems that we have right now related to water are going to be made better by climate change. Thats not going to happen. Its unsurprising that Wheeler is calling for a massive mobilization to tackle water woes without acknowledging the climate change link considering the administrations relentless push to boost domestic fossil fuel production. It is also reminiscent of former Interior Department chief Ryan Zinkes response to wildfires in the western United States. And in an interview with Fox Business after returning to Washington D.C. Zinke said whether climate change is contributing to the infernos is irrelevant to whats occurred. He emphasized the need for better forest management by pointing to themore than 120 million dead trees in California but failed to mention that the trees died because of a multi year drought that scientists have concluded was made worse by anthropogenic climate change. When a reporter later pressed him outside the White House Zinke said that of course climate change is a factor in the California fires a rather unconvincing acknowledgment considering previous remarks and the number of times Zinke cast doubt on the all but irrefutable body of scientific research that shows human carbon emissions are driving global climate change. Early in his tenure former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt prioritized fixing Superfund the struggling and financially strapped program responsible for cleaning up the nations most contaminated sites. The administration then turned around and proposed slashing funding for the program from 1.09 billion to 762 million. Pruitt said that it wasnt a lack of money that was plaguing the program but rather poor leadership and poor focus on the part of the Obama administration. Superfunds problems have almost everything to do with resources which have all but dried up over the last two decades. Superfund experts havesaid the administrations approach highlights its lack of understanding about how the program functions. EPA maintains that Superfund is a top priority and that it is making great strides in accelerating sites through remediation and back to productive use. Yet the 4.75 trillion 2020 budget blueprint the administration released this month once again calls for cutting Superfund dollars this time by 10 percent.	True	True	True	True	False
Climate scientist Cliff Mass is speaking out against academic political bullying from University of Washington faculty and students stemming from Masss rejection of a carbon tax initiative favored by activists. Science can only flourish when there is tolerance for a diversity of viewpoints and ideas Mass told The Daily Caller News Foundation. Name calling and politicization of science are toxic to the scientific enterprise and undermines our credibility in the general community. I am hopeful that the exposure of such intolerance will lead to an improved working environment in my department and among others in my discipline Mass said via email Wednesday. Climate scientist Judith Curry detailed in a blog postWednesday the actions UW and student activists have taken against Mass in recent months. Curry said Mass was a victim of academic political bullying. There are clearly UW faculty that dont like Cliff Mass including his department chair and most fundamentally they seem to dislike that his blog is getting in the way of their own political advocacy Curry wrote. Mass joined UWs Atmospheric Sciences Department in 1982 where he specializes in numerical weather modeling and weather patterns in the Pacific Northwest. Mass also publishes a science blog and has a popular weekly radio show. RELATED TheDCNF Asked Paris Climate Accord Backers If Theyd Support Banning Private Jets. Most Didnt Respond Mass is no global warming denier as many critics try to label him. Mass has repeatedly called global warming a serious threat and supported policies including carbon taxes to cut carbon dioxide emissions. Despite his agreement with the climate consensus Mass has increasingly come under fire from activists for not toeing the alarmist line when it comes to blaming extreme weather events on global warming. What seems to have driven Masss critics over the edge this time was the atmospheric scientists public opposition to a Washington state carbon tax ballot initiative called I 1631. In particular critics went after a blog post Mass wrote in mid October detailing why he opposed I 1631. Voters overwhelmingly rejected the carbon tax measure in November despite support from Gov. Jay Inslee and other Democrats. I 1631 will be a trough of billions of dollars of cash for left leaning social action and progressive groups and dealing with climate change will be a secondary priority Mass wrote in a blog post with a picture of pigs feeding at a trough. The picture has since been removed. The imagery of pigs feeding at a trough has long been used to describe special interest groups trying to syphon off government spending. State spending seen as wasteful or geared toward a special interest is often called pork or pork barrel spending. However UW students and climate activists claimed it was racist. I 1631 campaigner Izzy Goodman tweetedin October that this alone proves that he is a blatant racist which is probably why his climate policies are too!. She later added UW you going to stand for this? When Mass tried to reason with her UW philosophy Ph.D. candidate Alex Lenferna tweeted Calling you racist for saying racist things is not name calling its an accurate description. The post showed Masss small government racist anti working class view tweeted Lenferna who also campaigned for I 1631. Student activists didnt stop at Twitter insults. Curry who spoke at length with Mass about the events wrote The attacks ramped up when a group of students complained to the Assistant Dean for Diversity Equity and Inclusion. Curry said the students accused Mass of deception being on the payroll of oil companies purposely obfuscating with multiple twitter accounts racism misogyny tokenism Trumpism. Rather than meet with Cliff Mass to discuss the Assistant Dean sent a mass email to the faculty of the Atmospheric Sciences Department echoing student complaints Curry wrote. The assistant deans email claimed the blog had imagery and text that was racially insensitive and caused offense to a significant number of members in the departmental community. The assistant dean made no attempt to contact Mass or try to understand that there was no racism evident or intended and that the image in question was quickly removed from the blog post Curry wrote. The matter didnt end there however and Atmospheric Sciences Department Chair Dale Durran sent a mass email to the Department faculty including the link to Lenfernas post and voicing concern about Mass behavior and racism' Curry noted. Durran held a faculty wide meeting on Dec. 4. Durran reportedly took control of the meeting and even prevented Mass from finishing his opening remarks. RELATED Washington Governor Warns There Is Not Survival From Climate Change. That Is Unless His Policies Are Adopted Durran hectored Mass throughout the meeting Curry wrote. The activist students were true to form hurling all kinds of insulting personal and inappropriate remarks as Mass sat through the inquisition. Duran was an ardent supporter of I 1631. Durran got 21 of his colleagues to sign a public letter published in The Seattle Times in late October endorsing the carbon tax ballot measure. Now is the time to take a big step to kick our carbon habit Durran and his colleagues wrote. However Curry reported that several faculty members felt uncomfortable signing this including one who told her they actually voted against the measure. Durran did not respond to TheDCNFs request for comment.

NASAs Cassini spacecraft has detected hydrogen molecules in the geysers shooting off the moon Enceladus possibly the result of deep sea chemical reactions between water and rock that could spark microbial life scientists announced Thursday. NASA and others are quick to point out this latest discovery does not mean theres life on Enceladus ehn SEHL uh duhs but that there may be conditions favorable for life. A liquid ocean exists beneath the icy surface of Enceladus which is barely 300 miles 500 kilometers across. Scientists have long known about the plumes of water vapor spewing from cracks at the moons south pole thanks to Cassini . The heavy presence of hydrogen suggests chemical reactions between the warm water and ocean floor rock that could support life. Cassini uncovered the hydrogen during its final close flyby of Enceladus in 2015 when it dove deeper than ever through its plumes of vapor and particles. The researchers reported that the hydrogen along with carbon dioxide that was also found could mean that undersea microbes are producing methane as they do in the bowels of our own oceans and waterways. It really represents a capstone finding for the mission said Cassinis project scientist Linda Spilker noting that the spacecraft has been circling Saturn for more than a decade. We now know that Enceladus has almost all of the ingredients that you would need to support life as we know it on Earth she said at a NASA news conference. A press conference viewer asking questions of the scientists via Twitter asked if NASA was talking about bacteria or algae or giant squids. Most of us would be excited with any life said Mary Voytek an astrobiology senior scientist for NASA. Were going to start with bacteria and if we get lucky maybe theres something thats larger. The findings were reported Thursday in the journal Science by a team from Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. Launched in 1997 and now finally running low on fuel Cassini is drawing ever closer to its demise. The spacecraft will duck through the gap between Saturn and its rings 22 times before spiraling out of control and vaporizing in the sky above Saturn this September. Cassini has no instruments that can detect life so it will be up to future robotic visitors to seek out possible life on Enceladus the scientists said. Europa an ice covered moon of Jupiter also believed to have a subsurface ocean may have water vapor jets spewing into space as well similar to Enceladus. The Hubble Space Telescope has observed what looks to be plumes emanating from Europa. A spacecraft under development called the Europa Clipper to launch sometime in the 2020s could shed more light on the matter. Voytek said her money is still on Europa for potential life versus Enceladus since Europa is much older and any potential life there has had more time to emerge. While questions remain Thursdays news represents an important advance in assessing the habitability of Enceladus Woods Hole Oceanographic Institutions Jeffrey Seewald wrote in a companion article. We still have a long way to go in our understanding said Seewald who was not involved in the study. Future missions to explore oceans beyond Earth will answer many of these questions.

CNN The new government report on climate change which the Trump administration released quietly a day after Thanksgiving and two days after President Donald Trump tweeted skeptically about the existence of climate change warns that the drastic human effects on the climate could cause thousands of Americans to die and cost the US economy hundreds of billions of dollars. But even before the report was made public Americans were extremely worried about climate change. Almost two thirds 64 of voters said the US needs to be doing more to address climate change according to a poll by Quinnipiac University in August up from 57 who said the same in December 2015 This opinion is divided by party lines 91 of Democrats said more should be done and 67 of independents agreed. Fewer Republicans one third said more should be done about climate change and another third of Republicans thought that the US is doing enough to address climate change. In the December 2015 Quinnipiac poll 83 of Democrats thought the US should be doing more compared to 62 of independents and 26 of Republicans. The Trump administration chose to speed up release of the new report which is required by law putting it out on Black Friday instead of in December. It also came two days after Trump issued another tweet transmitting his skepticism of the existence of Climate change. Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS Whatever happened to Global Warming? he said Wednesday on Twitter. An earlier portion of the climate change report was released in November 2017 and found no convincing alternative explanation for the changing climate other than human activities especially emissions of greenhouse gases. Trump has stood by his years old claim that climate change is a hoax and emphasized that belief with his statements about the California wildfires which he said were a result of poor forest management drawing criticism from firefighters climate scientists and many others. The government report which is called the National Climate Assessment addressed wildfires reporting that one impact of climate change will be longer and more destructive wildfires that could burn up to six times more forest annually by 2050 in parts of the US. California's wildfires are the worst in the state's history. Over half 53 of voters in the August Quinnipiac poll said climate change is a factor in making fires more extreme. At that point the fires in California were only beginning and some are still burning in November so it's unclear whether that number has changed since August. Eight in 10 Democrats 54 of independents and 22 of Republicans thought in August that climate change has an impact the fires. Another impact of climate change will be on the health of Americans whether because of extreme heat and higher temperatures diseases like Zika that come from mosquitoes and ticks more food and waterborne diseases or higher risk of asthma and allergies. Concern about climate change and global warming has gone up in the last few years from 33 who said they worry a great deal about it in March 2013 to 43 who say the same now according to Gallup Around the same number 45 said they think global warming will pose a serious threat to them or their way of life in their lifetimes in the March poll. That's up from 2010 when Gallup first asked it and only a third of Americans thought global warming would impact them. Democrats are much more likely to think they'll be impacted 67 than independents 45 or Republicans 18 but whether that's because more Democrats live in coastal regions or due to just plain partisanship it's hard to tell. In a statement by White House deputy press secretary Lindsey Walters the Trump administration downplayed the report saying it is largely based on the most extreme scenario which contradicts long established trends by assuming that despite strong economic growth that would increase greenhouse gas emissions there would be limited technology and innovation and a rapidly expanding population.

Former Vice President Al Gore said Monday that the U.S. is going through a challenging time under the Trump administration decrying President Trumps decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. Weve never had a president whos deliberately made decisions the effect of which is to tear down Americas standing in the world starting with his withdrawal from the Paris Agreement Gore said Monday on NBCs Today Show. The climate crisis is by far the most serious challenge we face. Trump announced last month that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement an international pact signed by more than 190 countries to commit to fighting climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Gore who has spent much of his time after his 2000 presidential run crusading to fight climate change met with Trump last year at Trump Tower to discuss climate change. The meetings had given Gore hope that the president would come to his senses about the Paris Agreement. But I was wrong Gore said. He declined to elaborate on what was discussed in the meeting. Trump who has called climate change a hoax argued in June that withdrawing from the Paris Agreement would benefit the U.S. economy. Well the business community does not believe that at all Gore said on CBS Sunday Morning. There are now twice as many jobs in the solar industry as in the coal industry. In the U.S. the number of solar jobs is growing 17 times faster than the number of jobs in other industries Gore said calling the solar industry one of the brightest spots in our economic revival. But the former vice president who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his climate change work has faced pushback from some conservatives for his efforts. Fox Friends criticized Gore for comparing the climate change fight to fights against moral issues such as slavery and apartheid in a July 13 speech at the Ecocity World summit in Australia. The climate movement not least in cities is right now in the tradition of all the great moral causes that have improved the circumstances of humanity throughout our history Gore said in the speech. The abolition of slavery. Womens suffrage and womens rights. The civil rights movement and the anti apartheid movement in South Africa. Seriously?? Former VP Al Gore compares climate battle to fight against slavery and apartheid Fox Friends tweeted. The longtime climate change battle advocate has taken criticism of his work in stride. If everybodys just completely happy with what youre doing you may not be working hard enough to bring about the kind of change that we need Gore said on CBS. He added that hell continue to fight climate change adding I could not lay this fight down or put it aside even if I wanted to. I dont want to. On NBC Gore was quick to say that Trumps decision to leave the Paris Agreement is just one of the ways in which the president has hurt Americas standing in the world citing damage to international alliances such as NATO. The months ahead will be a test for the American people Gore said on NBC.	True	False	False	True	True
Reuters U.S. presidential hopeful Kamala Harris campaign is finalizing a plan to tackle climate change that will center on cracking down on fossil fuel companies and protecting poor neighborhoods from the worst impacts of global warming according to two sources familiar with the matter. The plan is meant to set the U.S. senator from California apart in a crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates by drawing on her experience prosecuting polluters as a California attorney general and district attorney. At the same time it is intended to assuage environmental activists worried that she has downplayed climate change on the campaign trail. All of the other top tier presidential candidates have already detailed aggressive plans to eliminate U.S. greenhouse gas emissions within 10 to 30 years tapping into what has become a crucial issue for Democratic voters. She wants to distinguish herself from other candidates that have already laid out climate plans with her own approach that plays to her strengths focusing on environmental justice and enforcement said one of the sources. Like the other candidates Harris plan will also likely target a swift end to fossil fuels use though the details are still being drafted the sources said. The campaign is expected to release the plan ahead of a climate change focused town hall with the candidates on Sept. 4 they said. A spokeswoman for Harris campaign Kate Waters declined to comment on the details but said Harris would be releasing something soon. While activist groups say they are generally happy with Harris environmental credentials she has drawn their criticism since launching her presidential bid. Last week for example she came under fire from the Sunrise Movement and other climate change activists when she initially declined to participate in the televised Sept. 4 climate change town hall to attend a fundraiser. Her campaign later announced she had changed her plans and would attend. During campaign speeches she tends to include a brief mention of climate change calling it a real crisis and adding that she would re engage the United States in global efforts to fight it if elected. Republican President Donald Trump has rolled back U.S. climate change rules he views as damaging to the economy and announced plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement an international accord to limit global warming. Bahram Fazeli director of research and policy for Communities for a Better Environment a California focused environmental justice group said Harris record on the environment was decent. As a senator Harris was among the original co sponsors of the Green New Deal a nonbinding congressional resolution to zero out U.S. emissions by 2030 and introduced bills to denounce Trumps efforts to roll back Californias vehicle emissions standards and drill for oil and natural gas in federal waters. She has also co sponsored an environmental justice bill with Green New Deal author congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez which includes the creation of a federal office for environmental justice. Previously as Californias attorney general Harris was charged with protecting the states progressive environmental laws in the courts. Her biggest environmental victory according to green groups came in 2016 when a grand jury indicted Plains All American Pipeline on criminal charges related to a 2015 oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara. She also reportedly launched an investigation in 2016 into whether Exxon Mobil lied to the public and shareholders about the risks of climate change though her office never confirmed the probe. Since then both New York and Massachusetts have pursued cases against the oil company. Earlier as district attorney for San Francisco Harris also created the citys first environmental crimes unit.

The creation of the new panel of climate change deniers and the recruitment of supporters to provide it with a veneer of legitimacy echoes the campaign by Joseph Stalins regime to discredit the work of geneticists who disagreed with the disastrous lysenko soviet union russia548786 pseudo scientific theories of Trofim Lysenko. Lysenko wrongly believed that acquired traits could be passed on by parents to their offspring. Stalin embraced lysenkoism as the basis for Soviet agricultural policy while also denouncing and persecuting Lysenkos scientific critics. The Trump administrations climate lysenkoism is being led by William Happer a retired professor from Princeton University who was hired by the National Security Council house role physicist happer 64 takes position senior science technology adviser in September 2018 as deputy assistant to the president and senior director for emerging technologies. Media reports suggest that Professor Happer and his fellow propagandists will target the Fourth National Climate Assessment which was prepared by leading researchers in the United States and concluded last November The impacts of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country. Although the report was subjected to rigorous review by Americas top experts at the National Academy of Sciences it was rejected by President Trump who told journalists I dont believe it. dire economic forecast climate change dont believe2118152002 Professor Happer who has not published any research on climate change in a reputable science journal has been celebrated for many years by climate change contrarians and deniers around the world. He was formerly a trustee of the George C Marshall Institute which received funding from ExxonMobil and other companies to spread doubt inside and outside the United States about the role of fossil fuels in climate change. It disappeared in 2015 and was replaced by the CO2 Coalition which was co founded by Professor Happer. The website for the Coalition asked questions 0283fe86 6ba7 makes many inaccurate and misleading assertions such as Readily available data from both governmental and non governmental sources confirms that extreme weather events in recent years have not happened more often or with greater intensity. In fact the Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published in 2013 concluded Changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed since about 1950. A recent leak of the Coalitons tax filing showed that its largest donors are conservative groups such as the Mercer Family Foundation and the Sarah Scaife Foundation which have a long track record of funding climate change denial. Professor Happer has also collaborated with climate change deniers in other countries such as the United Kingdom. In 2010 he joined the Academic Advisory Committee of the Global Warming Policy Foundation which was set up by Lord Lawson to campaign against polices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels. He stepped down from the committee when he was hired by the White House. The foundation published a pamphlet by Professor Happer reportshapper thetruthaboutgreenhousegases.pdf in August 2011 which disputed the scientific evidence that greenhouse gases are causing climate change. In July 2014 Professor Happer caused controversy during an interview on CNBC television climate expert demonization of carbon dio200107 in the United States when he claimed that the demonisation of carbon dioxide is just like the demonisation of the poor Jews under Hitler. Carbon dioxide is actually a benefit to the world and so were the Jews. He was also forced to defend himself after Greenpeace revealed an exchange of email messages Email Chain Happer O Keefe and Donors Trust.html during which Professor Happer discussed writing reports to promote climate change denial in exchange for a secret fee paid to the CO2 Coalition.

The Seychelles has created protected areas the size of Great Britain in the Indian Ocean. In exchange for getting some of its national debt paid off the island nation has agreed to protect 210000 sq km 81000 sq miles of ocean. The reserves will limit tourism and fishing activities in the Seychelles to halt further damage to aquatic life. A foundation set up by actor Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the investors that worked on the deal. The Oscar winner said This effort will help the people of Seychelles protect their ocean for future generations and will serve as a model for future marine conservation projects worldwide. Seychelles President Danny Faure said Our large ocean brings development opportunities but also responsibility. By planning properly to protect our environment we can be sure we are also protecting our people and their livelihoods against an uncertain future. This is understood to be the first debt swap designed to protect ocean areas in the world. The Seychelles government agreed the debt swap with the Nature Conservancy a US charity and a number of investors back in 2016. Under the terms of the 21m 15m deal the charity and the investors including the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation paid for a portion of the Seychelles national debt. The country will then direct future national debt payments into a new trust the Seychelles Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust SeyCCAT. This trust will offer lower interest rates on debt repayments and any savings will go to fund new projects designed to protect marine life and handle the effects of climate change. The Seychelles is raising the percentage of its protected waters from 0.04 to 30 by 2020 as part of the agreement. This first part of the plan creates two new marine parks. The first covers the Aldabra islands home to hundreds of thousands of tortoises nesting bird colonies and the dugong one of the more endangered species in the Indian Ocean. This area will be fully protected with only research and regulated tourism allowed. The second area concerns the seas around the Seychelles' main islands and will limit the fishing and tourism activities there. This is a critical accomplishment in our mission to bring conservation to scale across the globe said Nature Conservancy CEO Mark Tercek. What you see today in Seychelles is what we expect to introduce in the Caribbean and other ocean regions facing the threats of climate change.	True	True	False	True	True
President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday that a series of deadly wildfires hitting California are 'being magnified made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren't allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized.' Trump complained that the water is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean and called for clearing forests as a means of stopping fires from spreading. He didn't thank the armies of firefighters who are battling the blazes or the nine people who have died in the infernos. In September 2017 Trump's Interior Department ordered national parks to clear underbrush and small trees as a preventive measure. Two White House spokespersons did not respond to a question Monday about what Trump's tweet meant. But the president's claim about water drew a combination of laughing and head scratching on Sunday although years of drought may be one factor in the fires' quick spread. 'It boggles the mind' said UC Merced professor LeRoy Westerling who specializes in wildfire and climatology. 'We do manage all of our rivers in California and all the water is allocated many times over. So Im not sure what he was recommending' he told the San Francisco Chronicle. The only broadly discussed proposal for diverting water away from the Pacific came three years ago from a group calledTree People which called for more Californians to collect rainwater draining off roofs and down concrete streets. California already strictly metes out water rights for agricultural industrial and residential use. Firefighters haven't complained about a lack of water resources. And most engaged in the effort are using chemical flame retardants. The White House also announced Sunday that Trump had issued a 'major disaster' declaration in affected areas of Shasta County where about 150000 acres west of the city of Redding are engulfed in flames. That move gives Californians access to unemployment assistance food aid and legal and mental health counseling and makes federal financial assistance available to cities and counties that will have to repair billions of dollars worth of infrastructure damage. It also allows federal agencies to help battle the 17 major fires burning throughout the state including what is now known as the 'Carr fire' which is just 40 per cent contained and has incinerated more than 1000 homes.

SACRAMENTO Calif. Commissions that oversee coastal lands and water pushed the Trump administration to leave California out of plans to expand offshore drilling saying the state will throw up any barriers possible to prevent pumping and transportation of oil. The warning came weeks after Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said he wants to open nearly all U.S. coastlines to offshore oil and gas drilling. Since then the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has proposed six sales of drilling rights off the California coast and a seventh off Oregon and Washington between 2020 and 2023. Given how unpopular oil development in coastal waters is in California it is certain that the state would not approve new pipelines or allow the use of existing pipelines to transport oil from new leases onshore the State Lands Commission wrote in a letter Wednesday to federal officials. The commission controls up to 3 miles offshore at which point federal jurisdiction kicks in. It has not allowed drilling in the state controlled waters since a 1969 oil spill near Santa Barbara. State and local governments could also block the construction of helipads and other infrastructure on land needed to support offshore operations. In the 1980s many coastal cities passed ordinances to block such infrastructure when President Ronald Reagan looked to expand offshore drilling. Many of those laws remain in place. Drillers could find ways around state and local restrictions such as pumping oil directly onto ships for transport but the process is expensive and may not be profitable if oil prices remain relatively low. A separate letter from the California Coastal Commission warned that an oil spill would devastate the states tourism economy and coastal beauty. The letter pointed to the Santa Barbara spill which caused severe environmental damage hurt the fishing industry and dissuaded tourists from visiting. The commission has authority to review activities in federally controlled waters. It cant block drilling but could file a lawsuit contending the move doesnt meet ocean management plans approved jointly by the state and federal governments in the 1970s. Weve fought similar efforts before and we will fight them again Coastal Commission Chair Dayna Bochco said. The state agencies weighed in ahead of a public meeting Thursday in Sacramento the only opportunity for people to register their opinions in person to the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. Fishermen environmentalists surfers and other critics demonstrated outside the state Capitol before marching to the meeting at a nearby library. Several demonstrators chanted in opposition at the open house style meeting where bureau scientists talked one on one with visitors and collected written comments. Why do we want to let someone start drilling for more oil when we need to be putting money into resources for green economy and green fuel said Jim Wilson a 71 year old retired mail carrier from Placerville outside Sacramento. Earlier in the day the California Assembly voted overwhelmingly to oppose renewed drilling. We are California and we will fight back to protect our beautiful coast said Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi of Torrance. Republicans Randy Voepel of Santee and Travis Allen of Huntington Beach said California can safely harvest oil and gas. Allen a GOP candidate for governor said that could help lower gasoline prices. Most of Californias outer continental shelf the area that would be opened to drilling is in shallow water where operations are not complicated said Tim Charters senior director of government and political affairs for the National Ocean Industries Association a trade group for the offshore energy industry. Its critical to keep the dollars at home create the jobs locally instead of sending the money overseas and creating jobs in foreign places he said. Zinke angered critics when he said drilling off Floridas coast would remain off limits prompting California Gov. Jerry Brown and others to request a similar exemption. Regulators later said no final decision had been made about Florida. On Tuesday more than 100 demonstrators gathered outside Oregons state Capitol in Salem to denounce the proposal. A day later in New Jersey more than a dozen groups held a rally in the driving rain on the Asbury Park boardwalk to demonstrate their opposition. Twenty three meetings are planned nationwide in coastal states. Comments can be submitted online through March 9.	True	True	False	True	True
A federal judge smacked down a new effort by the Trump administration to roll back an Obama era rule aimed at restricting harmful methane emissions from oil and gas production on federal lands according to a new report on Wednesday. The news comes as Donald Trumps Interior Department was in the process of delaying the regulation until 2019 calling it too burdensome to the industry. More from the report via The Washington Post The order by a judge in San Francisco came as the Interior Department moved to delay the rule until 2019 saying it was too burdensome to industry. The action followed an earlier effort by Interior to postpone part of the rule set to take effect next year. U.S. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Laporte of the Northern District of California said Interior had failed to give a reasoned explanation for the changes and had not offered details why an earlier analysis by the Obama administration was faulty. She ordered the entire rule reinstated immediately. As the U.S. Magistrate Judge Laporte noted in her ruling the reason she called for the Obama era rule to be reinstated right away is that the Trump administration cannot give a reasoned explanation as to why its flawed. In a way that cuts to the heart of everything this administration has done so far when it comes to environmental policy. After all there is no reasonable explanation for anything this president has done when it comes to the environment whether its allowing toxic sludge to be dumped in our waterways or pulling out of the historic Paris climate accord. While the previous administration let science and data drive its climate agenda the Trump administration has had one goal in mind destroying former President Obamas environmental legacy. On Wednesday one federal judge reminded Donald Trump that hating Barack Obama is not a good enough reason to ignore key environmental protections.	True	False	False	True	True
Former Secretary of State John Kerry and Rep. Thomas Massie R Ky. had a heated exchange Tuesday over Kerry's education andclimate change. Kerry 75 appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing to talk about climate change. The incredible exchange began when Massie read a quote Kerry said regarding President Trumps advisers. It sounds like youre questioning the credentials of the presidents advisers but I dont think we should question your credentials today. Isnt it true you have a science degree from Yale? Massie asked Kerry. Kerry replied that he had a bachelor of arts degree from the university. JOHN KERRY 'IT'S A MISTAKE TO TALK ABOUT IMPEACHMENT' Yes its political science the former Massachusetts senator said. So how do you get a bachelor of arts in science? the congressman asked. So its not really science. I think its somewhat appropriate that somebody with a pseudoscience degree is here pushing pseudoscience in front of our committee Massie said before Kerry fired back. Are you serious? I mean this is really happening here? the former secretary of state asked. JOHN KERRY SLAMMED FOR 'SHAMEFUL' SHADOW DIPLOMACY AFTER ADMITTING TO MEETINGS WITH IRAN The two men continued their back and forth before Massie asked Kerry if he was saying the president doesnt have educated adults there now. I dont know who he has there because it'ssecret he replied. Why would he have to have a secret analysis of climate change? The two then began to discusscarbon dioxide levels on the planet today versus millions of years ago. But there werent human beings that was a different world folks Kerry said. So howd it get to 2000 parts per million if we humans werent here? Did geology stop when we got on the planet? Massie asked. This is just not a serious conversation Kerry fired back. Its almost as if someone said Congress has hit rock bottom and Massie replies with hold my beer he wrote. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Massie replied to Kerrys tweet saying Its almost as if someone said No one has less knowledge of science a higher opinion of himself and a bigger carbon footprint than Al Gore and Kerry replies hold my champagne Im going to testify as a climate change expert.

Democrats and conservatives alike say they can help President Donald Trump cut corporate taxes and put money in the pockets of American taxpayers but it will come at a price penalizing coal miners and fossil fuel interests for contributing to global warming. A pair of Democratic senators and the bipartisan Climate Leadership Council aim to make a fee on carbon emissions part of tax reform. Their plans would essentially transfer money from greenhouse gas polluters to individual and corporate taxpayers. The goal of a carbon tax is to reduce the use of goods and services that produce greenhouse gas emissions and to convince companies to reduce their emissions. That would be a hard pill for Trump to swallow given his pledge to revive the coal industry and put miners back to work.	True	True	False	True	True
Strong winds on Sunday were expected to hamper progress for crews battling California wildfires which have now claimed at least 79 lives. Gusts of up to 50mph were threatening efforts to control the Camp blaze which is still only 55 contained 10 days after it brought devastation to northern California. The fire which destroyed nearly 10000 homes and has spread across 233sq miles is already the deadliest American wildfire in a century. And there are fears that the eventual death toll will rise much higher with almost 1300 people still unaccounted for. However it seems likely that number of missing persons may be an over estimate amid confusion over the way the list has been compiled. Butte county sheriff Kory Honea has stressed that the roster has been built up from missing person reports from calls reports and emails since the fire began on 8 November. He has described it as raw data and said there is the likely possibility that the list contains duplicate names and some evacuees who have not reported themselves safe. Californias outgoing Democratic governor Jerry Brown visited the scene of devastation at the town of Paradise with Donald Trump on Saturday. He told CBSs Face the Nation that Trump has got our back and has committed emergency support. Trump initially blamed state officials for poor forest management in making the fires in northern and southern California worse and even threatened to cut off federal funding. At the scene on Saturday Trump recounted a conversation he had in Paris on 11 November with Finlands president Sauli Niinisto who talked about monitoring forest resources with a good surveillance system. Trump said wildfires werent a problem in Finland because the Finns spend a lot of time on raking leaves and cleaning and doing things. But Sauli Niinist president of Finland told one of the countrys leading newspapers Ilta Sanomat on Sunday that he never discussed raking with Trump. I mentioned to him that Finland is a land covered by forests and we also have a good monitoring system and network Niinist said but had no recollection of mentioning raking of leaves or forest undergrowth which the president appears to have seized on as a key point in wildfire prevention while dismissing the issue of global warming. Asked on Saturday whether he thought climate change had a role in the fires he said you have a lot of factors. And asked if seeing the devastation changed his mind on climate change Trump said No. No. I have a strong opinion. I want great climate. Were going to have that. Jerry Brown in the interview aired on Sunday said Changing climate and the increasing drought and the lower humidity and water vapor were important factors. He said Managing the forest is part of it. Theyre a lot denser than they were 200 years ago. But on top of that we have this five year drought. We have reduced rainfall. We have the dryness that turns vegetation and bushes and houses and trees into literally into timber. So its ready to explode. So there is an atmospheric element which is part of the natural cycle and then there is an increasing effect of climate change. But asked if he had made that case to Trump he said I certainly raised it but I didnt feel that that was where we needed to go then added that science would be the guide for analysing the fires and the president in no way negated that.

Arriving at the UN General Assembly US President Donald Trump paid no attention to Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg. Caught on camera her stare sparked a thousand tweets and divided the public. While Thunberg was giving a fiery speech at the UNGA Climate Action Summit Trump was speaking at an event about religious freedom. Video from the UN headquarters on East River shows Thunberg scowling as Trump enters the building to speak to reporters not even registering her presence. Trumps critics were quick to make Thunberg their sherodescribing her stare their new life goals and declaring that the 16 year old climate activist became president today. We are all Greta another resistance activist proclaimed sharing a photo of Thunberg scowling at Trump next to a photo of her meeting his predecessor Barack Obama. Conservatives who saw the images reacted differently praising Trump for ignoring Thunberg as if he did it on purpose and even meme ing her scowl to music and song lyrics. Trump has nixed dozens of Obama administration environmental regulations calling them deadly to the economy much to the outrage of climate activists. A faction among the Democrats has since proposed a Green New Deal that would eliminate carbon emissions altogether and reorder the US economy entirely warning that otherwise the world would end in 12 years. Thunberg is even more pessimistic. At the current rate the world will go over the carbon emissions cap in eight and a half years she warned in her speech on Monday. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words she thundered at the world leaders on Monday. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you! Thunbergs fiery speech was likewise met with praise or disdain depending on where one stood in regard to the narrative of manmade climate change. The environmentalist movement is increasingly convinced that humanity is destroying the planet and has already called for banning the production and consumption of meat outlawing fossil fuels and shuttering down nuclear power plants despite the cost and burden on people that may produce. Later on Monday the president did finally notice the young activist. In an apparent jab at Thunberg he tweeted she looked like a very happy girl alongside a clip of her 'angry' address before the UN.

In an interview with Breitbart News last month the former Montana congressman and Navy SEAL dismissed reports that his days in the Trump administration were numbered as nothing more than rumors. But the intense scrutiny Zinke was certain to face next year from House Democrats wielding new oversight authority turned out to be a fight that he or perhaps the boss hes been so loyal to wasnt up for. President Donald Trump announced early Saturday that Zinke will resign at the end of the year. Zinkes final day as agency chief will be Jan. 2 The Associated Press reported Saturday citing his resignation letter. Thats one day before Democrats take control of the House of Representatives. In recent weeks some Democratic lawmakers made clear that they intended to investigate both Zinkes personal conduct and policy decisions. He has faced nearly 20 federal investigations one of which has been referred to the Justice Department for possible criminal violations. Rep. Gerry Connolly D Va. the vice ranking member of the House oversight committee told HuffPost last month that Zinke is definitely going to be a subject of great interest following a complete desert of oversight under the Republican watch. Since Trump took office Republicans on the House oversight committee have denied more than 60 subpoena requests from Democratic members including one related to Zinkes reassignment of career employees. And Rep. Raul Grijalva D Ariz. one of Zinkes fiercest critics in Washington and the incoming chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee told Outside Magazineand other outlets he was prepared to subpoena Zinke if necessary to obtain information. In his resignation letter to Trump Zinke wrote that vicious and politically motivated attacks against him had created an unfortunate distraction according to the AP. And in a statement posted to Twitter the ongoing agency chief said he cannot justify spending thousands of dollars defending myself and my family against false allegations. While it appears on the surface that Zinkes departure was a personal decision the AP and The New York Times reported Saturday that the White House forced him out over concerns about ongoing scandals mounting scrutiny and negative press. This is no kind of victory but Im hopeful that it is a genuine turning of the page Grijalva said in a statement. The next secretary should respect public desire for strong environmental standards and an end to corporate favoritism. There had been numerous signs that Zinke was possibly on his way out. Last month Trump told reporters that Zinke is doing an excellent job but that he would take a look at the allegations against him and soon make a decision about his future. Zinkes personal attack last month against the congressman soon to wield oversight power over him only added to the speculation. In recent interviews and public appearances Zinke seemed to be working to maintain his boss approval. He told Bloomberg that Trump is great to work for despite occasional calls at 2 a.m. and that if you do your job he supports you. And Zinke repeatedly touted the administrations effort to boost domestic fossil fuel production while continuing to ignore the scientific communitys dire warnings that we are running out of time to rein in greenhouse gas emissions and stave off catastrophic climate change. Im proud of the fact that were the No. 1 oil and gas producer in the world he said at a Dec. 11 briefing to announce a proposed rollback of Obama era clean water rules. Im proud of the fact that were going to get even better. Because when America prospers the world is safer. Stepping down now may spare Zinke some embarrassment but it will not reduce the need for oversight of the Administrations poor stewardship at Interior Rep. Don Beyer D Va. said in a statement. For all his feigned swagger Ryan Zinke lacked the courage or integrity to face accountability skipping town as soon as he faced scrutiny Evers said. Unfortunately for the American people Zinke leaves behind a deputy secretary with similar ethical concerns. It is high time for the glare of sunlight to focus on Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt. Well see if he has the spine to answer questions that Zinke lacked.	True	True	False	False	False
ROME Pope Francis told a group of lawyers that he could like to introduce the category of ecological sin into official Catholic teaching. We must introduce we are thinking about it in the Catechism of the Catholic Church the sin against ecology the ecological sin against the common home because it is a duty the pope said Friday in addressing participants in an international conference on penal law. More specifically Francis said are all those actions that can be considered as ecocide for instance the massive contamination of air land and water resources the large scale destruction of flora and fauna and any action capable of producing an ecological disaster or destroying an ecosystem. Ecocide is to be understood as the loss damage or destruction of the ecosystems of a given territory so that its utilization by inhabitants has been or can be seen as severely compromised he said adding that such a sin is a fifth category of crimes against peace which should be recognised as such by the international community. The pontiff said that such actions are usually caused by corporations and an elementary sense of justice would require that they be punished for them. An ecological sin is an action or omission against God against ones neighbour the community and the environment Francis said quoting the Fathers of the recently concluded Pan Amazon Regional Synod. It is a sin against future generations and is manifested in acts and habits of pollution and destruction of the harmony of the environment in transgressions against the principles of interdependence and in the breaking of networks of solidarity between creatures. Above and beyond its sinfulness failure to care for the environment is an injustice and a crime Francis suggested and should be legally enforced. I would like to appeal to all the leaders and actors in this area to contribute their efforts to ensuring adequate legal protection for our common home he said. The popes words coincided with the release of a new survey by the Pew Research Center which found that church going Americans accept their clergys on spiritual matters but generally distrust their advice on issues such as climate change. Pew found that 68 percent of U.S. adults who attend religious services at least a few times a year say they have a lot of confidence in the advice of their clergy on growing closer to God yet just a small fraction of this number 13 percent say they have this confidence when the topic is climate change. Pope Francis has thrown his moral weight behind the battle against anthropogenic climate change but has also acknowledged that the Church has no authority on scientific questions. In his 2015 encyclical letter on the environment Francis urging nations and individuals to exercise more responsible stewardship of the created world but insisted that he wanted to encourage debate rather than pronounce on environmental issues. On many concrete questions he wrote the Church has no reason to offer a definitive opinion she knows that honest debate must be encouraged among experts while respecting divergent views. Here I would state once more that the Church does not presume to settle scientific questions or to replace politics Francis said. But I am concerned to encourage an honest and open debate so that particular interests or ideologies will not prejudice the common good.	True	False	False	True	True
And on Monday 19 buses carrying more than 1500 activists from across the state converged on the state capital to protest Cuomos failure to do more about climate change in his eight years in office and make demands that looked identical to Nixons platform.It was the largest environmental protest against Cuomo since anti fracking activists staged demonstrations in 2014. To some Cuomos status as a climate pariah may be surprising. In 2014 he put a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing or fracking for natural gas in the state. In 2015 Al Gore joined the governor as he announced plans to cut the states greenhouse gases emissions 40 percent by 2030. Last June Cuomo loudly rejected President Donald Trumps move to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord ramping up New Yorks pledge to produce half its electricity from renewables by 2030 and forging a new alliance with the governors of Washington and California to stick to the goals agreed to by former President Barack Obama. Climate change is a reality and not to address it is gross negligence by government said Cuomo according to a new page on the state website with the banner Environment Leadership. But Cuomos policies still fail to meet even the baseline targets scientists say are needed to make a difference on global warming. His reduction targets focus exclusively on power plants ignoring the majority of the states emissions that come from buildings and vehicles. He has no plan to get the state to 100 percent renewable electricity and has offered little to protect low income communities and neighborhoods of color that suffer most from the impacts of climate change. The states pension funds remain invested in fossil fuels and polluters face no penalties in the form of fines on climate linked damage or taxes on emissions. As Nixon gains in the polls and lands magazine covers Cuomo is scrambling to act on long neglected progressive demands. Three weeks ago over coffee and cookies at a Manhattan steakhousethe governor made a deal to disband the Independent Democratic Conference known as the IDC. The group of eight breakaway Democrats in the state Senate caucused with Republicans guaranteeing a conservative majority in the chamber now only one holdout Brooklyn Democrat Simcha Felder has left Republicans with a flimsy one vote majority. Cuomo also signed an executive order last week restoring voting rights to felons on parole and voiced support for legalizing recreational marijuana a policy Nixon made a platform issue in her campaign. On Friday almost simultaneous to the release of Nixons climate platform Cuomo denied a water quality permit to a new natural gas pipeline environmentalists have protested for months and announced a new energy efficiency initiative that would account for one third of the emissions cuts required to meet his 2030 target. But Cuomos next big test on climate change is one he has already failed twice. For the third time in as many years the state assembly is slated to vote this week on the latest version of the New York State Climate and Community Protection Act known as the CCPA. The bill is widely considered the most ambitious and egalitarian climate legislation introduced anywhere in the nation. Heather McGhee president of the left leaning think tank Demos and the economist Robert Reich called it the most progressive climate equity policy weve seen. The legislation first introduced in 2016 calls for 100 percent renewable energy statewide by 2050 and orders state agencies to draft plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions from power plants buildings and vehicles. It requires 40 percent of state energy funding to go to the low income neighborhoods and communities of color most vulnerable to sea level rise and extreme weather and includes wage standards backed by labor unions for all state funded green energy projects. If enacted the bills proponents say it would create more than 100000 jobs. For Assemblyman Steve Englebright the Long Island Democrat who first introduced the CCPA the bill is 20 years overdue. The 71 year old lawmaker from Setauket a coastal hamlet on Long Island Sound started warning about the threat of runaway global warming two decades ago. He has since sponsored several bills to support solar and wind production at least three of which became laws. In 2016 he became chairman of the Assembly Committee on Environmental Conservation and moved swiftly to draft and introduce the CCPA. There needs to be some adjustments made in the perception of how important this bill is to bring it into the executive chamber ready for the governors signatureEnglebright said Friday. If we can get it onto his desk hell have no choice but to sign it. New Yorkers overwhelmingly support environmental regulations even at an economic cost. Seventy one percent of New Yorkers support expanding renewable energy generation even if it raises electricity prices compared to 61 percent nationwide according to Cooperative Congressional Election Studys 2016 survey results analyzed for HuffPost by Data for Progress a left leaning think tank. That support cuts across demographics including 75 percent of people aged 18 to 29 and 67 percent of people 65 years and older 73 percent of urban dwellers and 67 percent of rural New Yorkers and 74 percent of black people and 69 percent of whites. Sixty seven percent of New Yorkers support strengthening enforcement of clean air and water regulations even if it costs U.S. jobs compared to 58 percent nationwide. The support breaks down similarly across the state with 73 percent of people aged 18 to 29 and 61 percent of people 65 and older 71 percent of urbanites and 60 percent of rural people and 75 percent of black people and 64 percent of whites.

G7 energy ministers have failed to agree a statement on climate change this afternoonbecause of 'US reservations' it has emerged. Top officials from the Group of Seven industrial nations gathered in Rome Italy today amid growing concerns over the US administration's moves to unravel policies aimed at stalling global warming. Environmental activists fear US President Donald Trumpis dismantling Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan which aimed at reducing carbon pollution from power plants. Greenpeace was holding a sit in outside Monday's meeting calling on officials to maintain their commitments to reduce greenhouse gases under the 2015 Paris Agreement. However the US 'reserved its position' on the text about commitments made by G7 countries under the Paris accord said Carlo Calenda the Italian minister for economic development who chaired the meeting in Rome. The ministers' agenda had called for discussion of energy security policies to move away from coal natural gas routes and supply sustainable development of electricity sources alternative fuel scenarios and energy access and investments in Africa. Lacking unanimity Italy which currently presides the Group of Seven decided against proposing the joint statement Calenda said. The Paris Agreement endorsed by members of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC is a bedrock of international action against man made global warming. It vows to cap warming to 'well below' two degrees Celsius 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit compared to late 19th century levels an effort that scientists say will require massive cuts in carbon emissions from coal and other fossil fuels. It also pledges to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in aid for poor countries badly exposed to drought flood rising seas and other climate impacts. In March President Donald Trump signed an executive order rolling back some of the previous Democratic administration's policies on carbon emissions and climate change. Experts have said his plan which eases emissions limits for coal fired power plants and scraps more stringent vehicle pollution standards almost guarantees that the US will fail to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement. Trump has also said he does not intend to honour promises made by the administration of his predecessor Barack Obama to provide financial aid under the Paris accord. However Trump's team is also deeply divided on whether to withdraw from the pact according to US media reports. On March 30 the White House said a decision on whether to withdraw would be made ahead of the G7 summit in Italy in late May. Under Obama the United States the second biggest carbon polluter provided critical impetus for the Paris deal by concluding a precursor deal with China the number one emitter. The Group of Seven gathering the biggest western democracies comprises Britain Canada France Germany Italy Japan and the United States.	True	False	False	True	False
He recently posed for a GQ magazine photo shoot with a fly fishing rod in front of snow capped Montana peaks. He rode a horse named Tonto down the National Mall to his first day of work at the Interior Department. And earlier this month he donned a National Park Service uniform to greet park goers at the entrance of the Grand Canyon. Montana born interior secretary Ryan Zinke who meets with President Trump on Friday morning meticulously crafts his image as wilderness loving western cowboy and sportsman. But nine months into his job at the Department of the Interior the federal agency that oversees most public lands and natural resources the act is wearing thin with environmentalists and outdoors enthusiasts who say his early moves demonstrate strong allegiance to the oil gas and other extractive industries seeking access to some of Americas most spectacular protected landscapes. He has reversed an Obama era ban on coal mining on public lands and proposed changes that would shrink the borders of four national monuments set aside by previous presidents. His agency has taken early steps to open the door to oil exploration in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge one of the most symbolic and fiercely protected sites of the American environmental movement. Hes announced plans to repeal an important fracking safety rule and loosened safety guidelines for underwater drilling both major shifts away from Obama era environmental protection regulations. Earlier this week his agency set off a new firestorm of criticism by announcing that entrance fees for some of Americas most popular national parks will increase substantially next year. To make it cheaper for coal companies to strip mine in watersheds and make it more expensive for families to visit Yosemite is a perversion of American values said Michael Brune executive director of the Sierra Club. I think the secretary is a fraud. Meanwhile Zinke is also coming under scrutiny for other reasons including his use of private and military jets. According to Politico the secretary spent more than 12000 on a private jet to his home state of Montana and took a private plane to the US Virgin Islands. Zinke who declined to be interviewed for this story called the travel controversy a little BS in a public appearance. Most recently lawmakers from both parties in the mainland US and Puerto Rico have called for an investigation into how a tiny energy company in Zinkes hometown of Whitefish Montana won a major contract to rebuild power lines in hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico. The interior department has denied that Zinke played a role in the contract award. The interior department is in charge of the management and conservation of most federal lands and natural resources and it includes important divisions such as the National Park Service the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. As such the agency is often the arbiter between oil gas and mining companies seeking access to valuable resources embedded in public lands and environmentalists seeking to protect the same lands for biodiversity wildlife and recreation. Zinke has reshaped the department filling top political posts with former executives and lobbyist for the extractive industries. Deputy interior secretary David Bernhardt for example is a former lobbyist for the oil and gas industry. According to a report by the Western Values Project a progressive organization at least 21 of Zinkes political appointees have backgrounds tied to extractive industries. He sold himself as a Theodore Roosevelt Republican. That means wise use said Land Tawney president of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers a national conservation group headquartered in Montana. More and more sportsmen are waking up to whats going on. Since he took over the department Zinke has also resurrected an arcane military ritual requiring staff to hoist the department flag above the building whenever he enters. Zinke the son of a plumber and a realtor grew up in Whitefish a ski town of 4000 people in northwestern Montana. The6ft 4in secretary is a former high school and college football hero and a retired Navy Seal. Zinke made his name politically as a moderate Republican in Montanas legislature and easily won his first run for Congress in 2014 by a margin of 15 points. He repeated that success two years later despite questions about whether he actually lived in Montana and earlier suggestions that he failed to rise in the ranks of the Navy because of travel spending improprieties. Given his moderate politics in his home state many are scratching their heads over his hardline turn. Observers says hes not ideologically driven like Scott Pruitt the Environmental Protection Agency administrator who has set clear focused sights on dismantling environmental regulations in the United States for the benefit of industry. At his confirmation hearing Zinke said he was concerned about climate change and he regularly declares his love for public lands. Gloria Flora a former US Forest Service manager in Montana and prominent conservationist believes Zinke is fairly easy to explain in the context of political tribalism of the Trump era. Hes a Montanan. Hes on the Trump team. Hes doing Trump politics in every place but Montana she said. When its not personal then you revert to what your team has been saying and the values your team has. It is apparent Zinke wants to cultivate a folksy persona for the public but he doesnt want difficult interactions with that public. Earlier this month when he put on a park workers uniform to greet park goers at the entrance of the Grand Canyon a visitor questioned him on his proposal for national monuments. Zinke shut the man down with a smile and no answers. Whether the Trump administration succeeds in changing the shape of Americas public lands could depend on Zinke. For now his early moves and those potential changes appear to have galvanized a thriving opposition uncharmed by his cowboy style.	False	True	True	True	True
As California wildfires claimed their seventh victimDonald Trumpfinally weighed in on the tragedy with one of his most confounding tweets ever blaming California for the blazes because it diverts water to the Pacific Ocean. He also blamed the states bad environmental laws the most protective in the nation and trees. He called for a tree clear to stop fire spreading. He failed to express condolences to the families of the victims thank firefighters or offer comfort to Californians afraid for their lives homes and communities. California wildfires are being magnified made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which arent allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized. It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire spreading! Donald J. Trump August 5 2018 The tweet came just days after the Trump administration moved to scrap tough vehicle emissions standards initially established by California. The move would clear the way for vehicles to pump an additional 600 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by 2030. Thats the equivalent of the entire annual emissions of Canada. Its unclear what the president meant by water diverted into the Pacific. California allocates water among residents agricultural and industrial useand for wetlands and wildlife including water mandated to protect endangered species. But state waters eventually drain into the ocean.As one tweeter responded Water running into the Pacific Ocean is called a river. And firefighters havent complained of a lack of water for battling the blazes. The tweet could be a muddled indication of support for a GOP battle in Washington for a larger water allocation to farmers many of them Republican voters in the drought stricken states central valley. But its unclear how that would help staunch California fires. The scientific consensus is that fires are becoming more common because of climate change which Trump once called a Chinese hoax. Twitter users were stunned the president failed to express concern about people suffering in the fires. But most readers were stumped or derisive. One responded Thanks genius. Problem solved. As a professor who specializes in wildfire management there are a lot of things that are broken about how we prepare for fight wildfires... but its near impossible to overstate how ridiculous this comment is. Eric Kennedy August 5 2018 I had to come look if this was a real tweet. Ummmmm....gee..... You seem to know next to nothing about California. Fires are more often fought with flame retardant. Mowing down a forest to keep the forest from burning is on the crazy side. bree brinkenstein August 6 2018 Thank you for your heartfelt words of concern and support for the families who have lost everything. Primrose Lane August 6 2018 No you scientists have been seeing the fingerprints of all over these fires and it's making them far worse. Why don't you offer your condolences and then maybe read something aside from the McDonalds menu Miroslava Korenha August 6 2018 By tree clear I'm sure you're talking about logging. You're not interested in fire safety. All you want to do is destroy nature and make corporations richer. Audrey August 6 2018 How about a shout out to the 15000 Firefighters who are putting their lives on the line backed with a commitment of support? That is what a real President would do. Big Ass Mustache August 6 2018 JUST IN The President of the United States blames environmental protection laws for California wildfires and believes that useful fresh water is being diverted to the Pacific Ocean. It remains unclear if he also believes that the Earth is flat and the sun revolves around it. Trump Thoughts August 5 2018 So...you want to stop trees from catching on fire...by removing the trees...? But I thought you believed so strongly in the environment. You said so! Andrew August 6 2018 I fixed your tweet boo. Dont worry. I always got your back. My hart goes out to all those infected by the kalifornia wildfires. Im working alongside my addministration to formulate a plan of action to swiftly dayliver aids and support to all the suffered comuntitties. Joe Bereta of The Valleyfolk August 5 2018 So how do you explain the fires in Wyoming Idaho Nevada Arizona Texas and Montana? Those states aren't exactly models of environmental regulation and yet they are burning also. Eric Foltz August 6 2018 What are you going to do with the massive amount of water that doesnt exist in California? Your destructive environmental policy is what causes climate change. Stop rolling back fuel auto standards. Fix the EPA dont dismantle it. Be the solution not the problem. Right! Zardoz commands that Trump should be impeached!

After months of waging a public and at times bloody battle with protesters bivouacked outside its construction site in North Dakota law enforcement officers razed the encampment and arrested the holdouts. Meanwhile roughly 1700 miles east the company completed the final edits requested by regulators to its application to start building the Rover natural gas pipeline a 4.2 billion project through Ohio. That project had sailed through the permitting process and these markups would be its last. Project manager Buffy Thomason wanted to extend thanks to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency so she emailed the firms lobbyist in the state Art Arnold that evening. Arnold forwarded the message to Laura Factor the agencys assistant director less than an hour later. In the same email Arnold called the OEPA staff among if not the most honest and helpful people Ive encountered. OEPA Director Craig Butler described Arnold and Factor as good friends in a separate exchange with an agency colleague. Theyve done their jobs without beating us up in the process Arnold added. Theyve offered options when we were stuck. Theyve pointed us in the right direction so we could build the pipeline and stay within their good graces. But just a few months after those emails were sent Energy Transfer Partners and the state officials became embroiled in a vicious public fight over a massive drilling fluid spill and construction pollution. The company has flagrantly challenged the OEPAs authority infuriating the agency and eliciting a rare public investigation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or FERC the federal agency that regulates interstate electricity and natural gas operations. The dispute offers a cautionary tale in what one critic described as regulatory capture of a state agency by a company with deep ties to the Trump administration and a reputation as an environmental pariah unafraid to deploy scorched earth tactics against its opponents. The moves by Energy Transfer Partners further fuel fears of whats to come amid proposed steep cuts to the EPAs budget and a brazen campaign by U.S. Administrator Scott Pruitt to cozy up to fossil fuel interests. Energy Transfer Partners problems in Ohio began shortly after construction began on Rover in March. Heavy rains poured as workers built a stretch of the pipeline over flat farmlands and workers began dumping excess sediment laden water onto fields and into streams according to citations from the OEPA. Then in April the company accidentally leaked onto Ohio wetlands more than 2 million gallons of fluid used to lubricate the machines that bore pathways for underground pipes through a process known as horizontal directional drilling. The spill suffocated anything that lived in an area the size of nearly nine football fields under a foot or more of a slurry of nontoxic bentonite clay and water the agency said. On May 5 the OEPA ordered the company to submit a plan to address future spills restore the wetlands and apply for stormwater permitting. It also fined the firm 431000. In a sharp break from the charm it applied during the application process Energy Transfer Partners rejected the agencys demands insisting that because the pipeline crossed state boundaries the OEPA lacked the authority to make those orders. This kind of pushback were getting from Rover that says You have absolutely no state authority this is all a FERC issue and the tenor and tone theyve taken to interact with us doesnt happen often Butler said. This very negative response that weve gotten from Rover up until now and very recently is pretty uncharacteristic. On May 10 FERC stepped in to back up the state EPA halting construction at eight sites where Energy Transfer Partners had yet to begin boring the pipe. FERCs order has given environmental groups like the Sierra Club temporary reprieve from their own legal effort to block a pipeline they see as fueling climate change and endangering the environment in the state one of the proposed construction sites includes the Captina Creek the only cold water stream in Ohio with the right conditions for the endangered hellbender salamander to breed. But FERC allowed Energy Transfer Partners to continue work at the 22 other locations including the site of the largest spill. The company sent teams to vacuum up the drilling sludge from the wetlands and deposit it in two nearby quarries. Things took another turn on May 26 when the OEPA discovered traces of diesel in the samples collected from the spill site. Using diesel in the drilling fluids violated the permit FERC had granted forcing regulators to reclassify the site as an industrial accident. On June 1 FERC opened an investigation into the incident. On July 7 the OEPA once again sent a letter listing demands to Energy Transfer Partners. The letter reiterated orders made about two months earlier to apply for stormwater permits pay mounting fines nearing 1 million and submit a plan to restore the wetlands. The agency also directed the company to excavate the diesel contaminated slurry from the quarries dispose of it at solid waste landfills and install groundwater monitoring around the area to ensure that private wells werent affected. The company agreed only after FERC backed up the OEPA on the demands five days later. The OEPA said it will review Energy Transfer Partners submissions by next week to determine if its plans are in compliance. The OEPA said it remains committed to supporting oil and gas development in the state. StillButler the agencys director said Energy Transfer Partners received no preferential treatment during the application process despite what seemed like an amicable relationship at the start of the construction process. At the highest level this does not diminish our overall posture in terms of trying to support oil and gas development in the state including the development of pipeline networks he said. Weve got several of these large pipelines. Our only concern is while were supporting they at least have to follow the rules.	False	False	False	True	True
After Florida was hit by the devastating Hurricane Michael this week Sen. Marco Rubio R FL made it clear he would rather lie about climate change whichmakes these storms worse than commit to doing anything to stop it. On Sunday mornings edition of CNNs State of the Union host Jake Tapper pressed Rubio about the recent United Nations report on climate change which predicts global catastrophe if carbon emissions are not cut dramatically in the next 12 years. Do you believe climate change is at least in part man made? Tapper asked. Rubio said that while scientists agree that human behavior is contributing to climate change Icant tell you what percentage of that is due to human activity. He also claimed that many scientists would debate the percentage of what is attributable to man versus normal fluctuations. No matter what we do with laws lets say we went to all solar panels and did all that stuff which is not realistic this trend of sea level rise would still continue Rubio said. Instead of clean energy or reducing emissions Rubio said he is focused on strategies to mitigate those factors that are going be in place no matter what happens with our energy policy. But he added Im also not going to destroy our economy. Almost every word out of Rubios mouth was either a lie or a shameful dodge. There is overwhelming scientific consensusincluding from the United States government that human activity is the main driver of climate change. There is no debate among scientists about this. Human society is overwhelmingly responsible for our warming planet. Thats why it makes no sense to quibble as Rubio does about exactly what percentage of climate change is caused by humans. No matter what the answer is most or all of it. And contrary to Rubios assertions theUnited NationsIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC report says that drastic reductions in carbon emissions could in fact prevent the most catastrophic effects of climate change. The report says that in order to avoid irreversible global warming Global net human caused emissions of carbon dioxide CO2 would need to fall by about 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030 reaching net zero around 2050. Reducing our carbon emissions will also reduce the effects of climate change. Its as simple as that. But Rubio apparently wants to throw up his hands and claim that since rising seas will drown Florida no matter what all we can really do is strengthen levies or lift up roads and buildings. Rubio also seems to think that reducing carbon emissions would do more to destroy our economy than say allowing 1 million Florida homes to flood by the end of this century. Unfortunately Republicans like Rubio have joined Trump in ignoring science and doing everything they can to keep pumping as much carbon into the atmosphere as they can get away with. Americans deserve leaders who will do everything they can to prevent the catastrophic effects of climate change instead of waffling and lying about it like Rubio.

President Trump followed through on his campaign promise to withdraw from the Paris climate accord by formally announcing the U.S. intention to pull out of the agreement saying the move would help American workers and the economy. The Paris climate accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering an agreement that disadvantages the U.S. leaving American workers who I love and tax payers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs and lower wages and vastly diminished economic reduction Mr. Trump said. Following Mr. Trump's announcement reaction from both supporters applauding Mr. Trump's move as well as those who disagree with the pull out was swift across the political spectrum. The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created. I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack. But even in the absence of American leadership even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future I'm confident that our states cities and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got. Removing the United States from the Paris Agreement is a reckless and indefensible action. It undermines America's standing in the world and threatens to damage humanity's ability to solve the climate crisis in time. But make no mistake if President Trump won't lead the American people will. President Trump's decision is profoundly in conflict with what the majority of Americans want from our president but no matter what he does we will ensure that our inevitable transition to a clean energy economy continues. The Paris climate agreement was simply a raw deal for America. Signed by President Obama without Senate ratification it would have driven up the cost of energy hitting middle class and low income Americans the hardest. In order to unleash the power of the American economy our government must encourage production of American energy. I commend President Trump for fulfilling his commitment to the American people and withdrawing from this bad deal. I applaud President Trump and his administration for dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama Administration's assault on domestic energy production and jobs. President Obama made commitments in this deal based off a costly power plan that we knew at the time was on shaky legal ground. By withdrawing from this unattainable mandate President Trump has reiterated his commitment to protecting middle class families across the country and workers throughout coal country from higher energy prices and potential job loss. President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement is a devastating failure of historic proportions. Future generations will look back on President Trump's decision as one of the worst policy moves made in the 21st century because of the huge damage to our economy our environment and our geopolitical standing. Pulling out of the Paris agreement doesn't put America first it puts America last in recognizing science in being a world leader and protecting our own shore line our economy and our planet. It's now crystal clear President Trump is comfortable both ceding the moral high ground and the economic upper hand to countries like China and endangering the future of our planet. By walking away from this pact President Trump is abandoning America's leadership position in the fight against the climate crisis and is sending a strong message to the rest of the world to create design and manufacture clean energy solutions and create jobs elsewhere. If President Trump wants nations like China and India to take stronger and swifter action on climate then he should do so through the accountability and enforcement provisions in the Paris Agreement not by breaking our word and storming out of the room. Today the President announced that the United States will no longer be bound by an agreement unilaterally entered into by the Obama Administration. This was neither submitted to nor ratified by the U.S. Senate and is not in the best long term economic interest of the United States. President Trump's decision will prove to be the right course of action and one I fully support. Withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement isn't just a setback it's irresponsible. This damages our nation's reputation as an international leader and puts future generations at risk to the threat of climate change. Boston will not standby given what's at stake. As Mayor I will continue to work with U.S. Mayors and cities around the world to uphold the tenets of the Paris climate agreement and protect Boston against the very real impacts of climate change. As a Governor I always worked to balance economic growth and environmental protection. We can and we must do both. President Trump acted in America's best interest moving away from a flawed agreement that placed too heavy a burden on American jobs and opening the door to a new agreement that reaches the right balance. America will remain a leader in environmental protection. But we will not jeopardize our economy in order to please other counties that don't come anywhere near our environmental standards. The decision by the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change is a major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security. The Secretary General remains confident that cities states and businesses within the United States along with other countries will continue to demonstrate vision and leadership by working for the low carbon resilient economic growth that will create quality jobs and markets for 21st century prosperity. It is crucial that the United States remains a leader on environmental issues.	False	False	False	True	True
Environmentalists lamenting that a green wave didnt wash over Congress can find a glimmer of hope in the results of several key governor races. As of Wednesday it looks like Democrats committed to fighting climate change gained several key governorships that could accelerate local and national progress in clean energy. Democrat Stephen Sisolak won in Nevada Democrat Janet Mills won in Maine and Democrat Michelle Lujan Grisham won in New Mexico. In the past two years these states all passed renewable energy bills through their legislatures that were vetoed by Republican governors. But with these Democrats now heading into the governors mansions its very likely that these states will take another run at clean energy legislation. Sisolak for example campaigned on his support Question 6 one of the few state clean energy ballot initiatives that passed on Tuesday. This is a ballot measure that commits Nevada to getting 50 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. In fact as governor I would like to get us on the road to 100 percent Sisolak said in a campaign ad. Meanwhile Millss platform included cutting Maines greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2030. And Grisham advocated new rules to regulate methane a potent greenhouse gas and has a long voting record in the House as a representative of New Mexico in favor of bills to address climate change. Democrats flipped executive offices in other states as well. Democrat Tony Evers Wisconsins governor elect defeated incumbent Scott Walker on a platform that included a pledge to join 17 other governors committed to the goals of the Paris climate agreement. These wins are critical because governors have executive authority that allows them to dictate some state energy priorities. They also play a huge role in how federal environmental laws like the Clean Air Act are enforced. We saw this play out in North Carolina after the last election. The state passed a law in 2012 preventing the government from even considering the latest climate change science in its planning. Then Democrat Roy Cooper was elected and pulled an aggressive U turn going as far as to sign an executive order committing the state to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. In 38 states governors also appoint utility commissioners who shape investment in energy infrastructure and can help decide whether to keep an aging coal plant online or to rapidly deploy renewables. That gives states like Nevada another lever to drive climate policies. Legislatures in several states Maine Colorado New Hampshire Connecticut New York Minnesota also saw at least one chamber flip in favor of Democrats. In 13 states Democrats now control the governorship along with upper and lower legislative chambers. This would allow them to pass aggressive renewable portfolio standards and greenhouse gas targets. But other governors races did not go as well one high profile candidate who made climate change a key part of his platforms Democratic Florida gubernatorial contender Andrew Gillum lost. As for national level candidates several House members who deny climate change like California Republican Devin Nunes held on to their seats. And Carlos Curbelo a House Republican who proposed a carbon tax was outflanked by his Democratic opponent Debbie Mucarsel Powell. Curbelo also chaired the House Climate Solutions Caucus. The 90 member group counted 45 Republicans as members but just 24 of them will return in January. Since the caucus hadnt come up with many concrete solutions yet its unclear what it will do going forward. Several state clean energy and environmental ballot initiatives were also thwarted at the polls. Measures like Colorados anti fracking Proposition 112 and Washington states Initiative 1631 to price carbon emissions were defeated in part due to a firehose of money being unleashed by fossil fuel interests. What that means is that the bulk of climate change and energy advances were going to see in the United States over the next two years will come up through state legislatures and governors offices. But dont expect too much from a divided Congress and a president who is lackadaisical about whether climate change is even a problem.	True	False	False	True	True
Editors note Radley Horton is a professor at Columbia Universitys Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory where he studies climate extremes impacts and adaptation. He spoke with NewsHour economics correspondent Paul Solman for Thursdays Making Sene segment on flood insurance. The following excerpt of their interview has been edited for length and clarity. Paul Solman How certain are we or can we be that these storms and the flooding associated with them is a function of climate change? Radley Horton There are many components to these storms. And depending on what part were talking about the certainty differs. There are some aspects that are really a sure thing. For example we know that sea levels are rising. We know thats going to continue. And even if storms dont change at all just by virtue of raising that baseline raising that floor were going to see more frequent and more severe coastal flooding. But when we look at some of the really fundamental aspects of a storm itself theres more uncertainty. The balance of evidence suggests that the strongest storms will become stronger with stronger winds more storm surge as the planet warms and as the upper oceans warm. But we cant say its a sure thing. PS What about the larger cycles of the planet? Dont they override or mightnt they override the kinds of things we as human beings are doing in the short term? RH There are many things that can impact the climate for sure. But right now during this era that were living in human activities and the burning of fossil fuels is by far the most powerful influence. Just since the start of the industrial revolution weve increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by about 40 percent. Its already caused sea levels to rise close to a foot in many places along the U.S. coast. So thats increasing the risk of these types of storms. WATCH Less than half of Florida homeowners have flood insurance PS Cant we mitigate the effects of flooding? I mean thats what theyre doing raising houses all over the coastline in the United States and countries like Holland. RH The types of mitigation efforts youre talking about are critical. This is what we often hear referred to as resilience or adapting to a changing climate. And that has to be a key component of all strategies. We absolutely do need to strengthen that infrastructure whether its elevating buildings green infrastructure that can capture some of these excess water. We need those strategies. But you start to wonder at what point have things changed too much for us to be able to adapt to? For example if you look at parts of South Florida as sea levels rise as the water table rises no matter how much money you put into trying to build sea walls that water is just going to make its way up like Swiss cheese through some of that limestone. You cant hold the water back. PS So what would you advise somebody who lives in a floodplain? Should they just get out? Because many cant economically right? Or do they jack up their houses? Is that the best approach? RH If you live in a flood zone certainly you should be thinking about climate change. Thats one of the dimensions. But there are a lot of other factors that impact vulnerability as well. When people were assessing the risk originally and defining the flood zones they made estimates based on 10 20 years of rainfall data. Thats an insufficiently long sample to really estimate the true one in a hundred year risk. Another concern is that since that home was built there may have been changes in development in surrounding areas. If you look at what happened in Houston recently so much of the natural area had been covered up with pavement. That changes the flood risk. But when it comes to the climate change piece and if were talking about homes that are in coastal zones sea level rise is a game changer. PS When the federal government redraws a map in a place like Pequannock New Jersey and includes more and more houses hundreds more houses in the floodplain is the government potentially overreacting? RH The government is trying to update using the latest available information. More years of weather data are now available and thereve been changes in the land use in some of these regions as well that impact the path that that water takes. PS Has flood insurance basically induced people to take risks that they shouldnt be taking? RH Quite possibly. Thats why we need a much deeper discussion both about those properties that currently are insured and about uninsured properties and about properties that as the climate changes are going to be moving into newly defined flood zones. In the future we could see property values fall not because water touches or doesnt touch some of these homes but because of systemic risk the inability of insurance to cover all these assets or investors finally realizing that a lot of critical infrastructure isnt going to be fundable.

The proposal also says companies that emit greenhouse gases should be protected from lawsuits over their contribution to climate change. Michael B. Gerrard the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School and an expert on climate litigation said there had been four suits brought against energy companies over climate change including one brought by the eroding Arctic coastal town of Kivalina Alaska. None of those has gotten very far Mr. Gerrard said but there continues to be talk of more. Mr. Gerrard added If a sufficiently high carbon tax were imposed it could accomplish a lot more for fighting climate change than liability suits. The Climate Leadership Councils plan sets an initial tax of 40 per ton of carbon dioxide produced which would add 36 cents to the cost of each gallon of gasoline sold. The group estimates the tax would raise more than 200 billion a year and the rate would rise over time dampening demand for fossil fuels. The average family of four would receive approximately 2000 in the first year as a carbon dividend the group says. A tax and dividend plan would cut American carbon pollution even as the Trump administration withdraws from the Paris climate accord the group says. Exxon has said for years that it supports a carbon tax at least in the abstract but the company had never formally endorsed a proposal. In 2009 the companys chief executive Rex W. Tillerson who is now secretary of state called carbon taxes a more direct a more transparent and a more effective approach than a cap and trade proposal Congress was considering at the time. In a statement the current chief executive of Exxon Mobil Darren W. Woods said the company was encouraged by the climate groups proposal which aligns closely with our longstanding principles. A company spokesman said the liability component of the plan was not part of the companys decision to endorse it. Some environmental groups did not accept that explanation on Tuesday. Exxon is signing on to this carbon tax proposal because they know its dead on arrival in Congress said Jamie Henn a co founder of 350.org. He added that protection from liability would be important to Exxon which is under investigation for its past statements and actions on climate change. Along with the oil companies the plans corporate backers include Johnson Johnson Unilever PepsiCo and Procter Gamble. Ted Halstead the chief executive of the Climate Leadership Council said the group did not accept corporate contributions. Some environmental organizations including the Nature Conservancy and the World Resources Institute are endorsing the plan. Individual supporters include the theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking Steven Chu a secretary of energy under President Barack Obama Michael R. Bloomberg the former New York mayor and the Indian industrialist Ratan Tata. The plans Republican authors include James A. Baker III and George P. Shultz both former secretaries of state and Henry M. Paulson Jr. a former secretary of the Treasury. But Mr. Halstead said the council had moved a little more to the center adding new leaders like Lawrence H. Summers a secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton and Laurene Powell Jobs a philanthropist and the widow of the Apple founder Steve Jobs. For this to pass it will have to pass on a bipartisan basis Mr. Halstead said. Mr. Summers said the chances that Congress would pass a carbon tax in the near future were low. But he said there is a reasonable shot that there will be an opening that will be taken in the next several years especially because the dividends could benefit low income Americans. Its hard to argue against a fuel tax that Exxons in favor of he said.	True	False	False	True	True
Some of the regular Americans who are paying the price for Scott Pruitts leadership were in Washington DC this week and I had the honor of spending the day with them and hearing their stories. As we all know Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt headed to Capitol Hill Thursday where he was grilled by members of Congress on his many ethical scandals that have been making headlines for weeks. Just two days earlier people from across the US came to Washington to testify at EPAs lone public hearing on Pruitts proposed rollbacks of protections from toxic coal ash. Their stories of coal ash contamination were heartbreaking a North Carolina town where neighbors keep getting sick a community on the Navajo Nation where people drive 15 miles to haul water for livestock. The EPA had finally put very modest coal ash safeguards in place for these communities in 2015 and now Scott Pruitt is trying to take them away. As I told EPA in my testimony Families are looking to EPA to solve the coal ash problem not abandon them. If you dont defend these standards the Sierra Club and our allies will. One small town Alabama mayor summed up the thoughts of everyone in the room when he faced EPA representatives a simply said What are you doing? Have you lost your mind? Pruitts maneuver to weaken coal ash standards has sparked grassroots outrage from red states and blue states. He is handing out yet another favor to the corporate polluters whove been and marching orders since he took over the EPA. Pruitt is weakening the protections so that millionaire utility executives dont have to pay for affordable common sense fixes to Americas mounting coal ash problem. As I heard from scientists and the many families affected who spoke at the hearing earlier this week coal ash is the primary solid waste product of coal fired power plants and it contains some of the most dangerous toxic chemicals on earth like arsenic lead mercury and chromium. The toxins raise the risk for cancer heart disease and stroke and can inflict permanent brain damage on children. Its estimated that 1.5 million children live near the coal ash storage sites which are only getting larger with each ton of coal burned. In places like and on the weve seen the tragedies that coal ash spills and leaks can cause by devastating communities contaminating water and sending people to the hospital. In 2015 after years of scientific research and public comments the EPA finalized a set of basic clean water protections from coal ash that were cheap and easy for utilities to implement. These standards required coal plant owners to do things like line new coal ash dump sites with strong waterproof materials to make sure the dangerous contents of coal ash did not leach into soil and contaminate groundwater. They also provided local communities with online tools to monitor their groundwater to make sure that toxic heavy metals from nearby coal ash waste sites were not contaminating the water they used for farming drinking and cooking. In a cruel irony Pruitt announced these rollbacks the day after EPA reporting under the new standard revealed dangerous coal ash pollution in more than 70 sites around the country. Everyone deserves clean water free from toxic coal ash and the profits of utility executives should never be held in higher regard than the health of local communities.. After nearly a year in his position Pruitt has seemed more concerned with pushing the agenda of wealthy coal executives rather than doing his job to protect the environment and the health of the people who are suffering from the pollution created by coal plants. Nothing better illustrates this than the sweetheart deal Pruitt received from the wife of a dirty energy lobbyist who had business before the EPA . For a mere 50 a night he stayed in a plush multi million dollar condo near the United States Capitol. By day Pruitt was touting his rollback efforts to make it easier for energy companies and utilities to save money by polluting and by night he slept peacefully in a bed owned by someone who energy companies and utilities hire to do their bidding on Capitol Hill. As each day goes by and we find out more about Pruitts conflicts of interests and revelations about his failed judgement however its important to remember that his failures have real world impacts on the health of the people he is supposed to be protecting. Real families will be hurt because of his decision to roll back the clean water protections against coal ash people who cant offer him sweetheart deals on luxury housing. TAKE ACTION Stop the repeal of coal ash safeguards!	False	False	False	False	True
Here's the issue Pruitt told CNN in a phone interview. To have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm versus helping people or actually facing the effect of the storm is misplaced. He continued What we need to focus on is access to clean water addressing these areas of superfund activities that may cause an attack on water these issues of access to fuel. ... Those are things so important to citizens of Florida right now and to discuss the cause and effect of these storms there's the... place and time to do that it's not now. President Donald Trump has previously called climate change a hoax and Pruitt has led a push to roll back EPA regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions. Hurricane Irma is hammering a string of northeast Caribbean islands and making its way toward a possible hit on Florida over the weekend. As the Category 5 storm heads toward the Florida coast experts have been clear about how global warming has contributed to the increased strength of hurricanes this season. Gradually warming temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico as much as 2 degrees Celsius above average could be a pressure cooker for key ingredients of a hurricane extreme winds rainfall and storm surge. Pruitt said that it's up to Congress to eventually address the issue but right now the EPA's focus is on providing assistance to those in need in Florida. Congress should address that at some point. And Congress hasn't he said. All I'm saying to you is to use time and effort to address it at this point is very very insensitive to this people in Florida. Pruitt said that the EPA is putting extra attention into monitoring 80 toxic waste sites otherwise known as superfund sites in the case that they affect the water in Florida. As waters recede in Houston attention turns to chemical facilities There's a multitude of these kinds of sites he said. We are working in advance with the owners of those sites to secure those sites ... to prevent leakage andor harm to citizens in the area. Pruitt also said that to speed up the delivery of fuel and other critical supplies he rescinded all weight and driver restrictions on its highways. Florida has also tried to improve gasoline supplies by getting an EPA waiver for certain regulations that would normally restrict the kind of fuels it can use. He added he's embedded staff in towns and cities in Florida so that they can make real time decisions for the hurricane. My focus has to be on ... these areas that I described he said. And with all respect really that's where I have to focus on. After Harvey 'we have to protect ourselves' After Harvey 'we have to protect ourselves'	True	True	True	True	False
The attorneys representing young people who are suing the federal government in a major climate change lawsuit recently took the unusual step of filing an injunction to stop all new leases for fossil fuel production. If the injunction is granted it would lead to a nationwide moratorium on new fossil fuel permitting and leasing on federal lands and waters until the lawsuit is resolved. No small matter. However existing mining and drilling projects would still proceed. The Juliana v. United States lawsuit filed by 21 young plaintiffs is currently going through pre trial appeals at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The suit alleges that not only did the federal government fail to act to limit climate change it profited off of selling coal oil and gas rights. The government encouraged mining and drilling while knowing full well the hazards caused by burning these fuels namely climate change. In so doing the government has deprived the plaintiffs the youngest is 11 years old the right to a safe and stable climate system. The lawsuit was first filed in 2015 but has proceeded in starts and stops. At one point the Supreme Court stepped in to pause the case days before the trial before allowing it to go ahead. An appeals court has now stepped in to consider the governments motion to dismiss the case. Then on February 7 the plaintiffs filed their injunction against new fossil fuel extraction on government territory. Philip Gregory one of the lead attorneys representing the children filing suit explained that the injunction request is meant to address the urgency of limiting climate change by reducing emissions from fossil fuels immediately. With the case currently tied up in appeals the plaintiffs wanted to make sure the current state of affairs with respect to climate change doesnt get worse as the wheels of justice slowly turn. We would have preferred to go to trial submit our extensive evidence and have the judge require the defendants to come up with a plan a national climate recovery plan for how theyre going to go about doing this Gregory said. As Gregory and the other attorneys for the children wrote in their injunction request This injunction is urgently needed because despite long standing knowledge of the resulting destruction to our Nation and the profound harm to these young Plaintiffs Defendants ongoing development of the fossil fuel based energy system is actively harming Plaintiffs and jeopardizing Plaintiffs ability to obtain the full remedy in their case. Numerous experts including retired Navy Vice Admiral Lee Gunn economist Joseph Stiglitz and climate scientist Eric Rignot have also filed amicus briefs supporting the injunction against new federal fossil fuel development. In response the federal government argued this week that the injunction maneuver is a ploy to bypass proper legal proceedings. Indeed Plaintiffs by their present motion are essentially making a bid in this Court for a substitute mini trial or trial lite which is premature until the pure issues of law now being briefed in this interlocutory appeal are appropriately resolved as a threshold matter wrote attorneys for the US Department of Justice. They described the injunction request as an ambitious attempt to throttle important government functions superintending broad swaths of the national economy. The government also noted that the Juliana lawsuit was filed more than three years ago but the plaintiffs hadnt asked to block fossil fuel leasing until now which undermines the plaintiffs argument that without immediate action they would suffer irreparable harm. However Gregory noted that the government didnt object to any of the evidence presented in the plaintiffs injunction request nor did it present any new evidence for its request to deny the request. Because there is no contrary evidence then we are very optimistic that this injunction will go through Gregory said. The Juliana v. United States is just one of more than a dozen climate change lawsuits underway in the US right now. Besides suing the government several counties and cities are seeking damages from coal oil and gas companies for contributing to climate change which in turn is posing a public nuisance to these jurisdictions. Legal experts say that these lawsuits are long shots and theyre testing the limits of what existing jurisprudence covers. But if they succeed they could set critical precedents lead to billion dollar payouts and radically reshape the effort to limit global warming.	True	False	False	True	True
Over the course of seven hours the top ten Democratic candidates for president in 2020 committed to radical solutions to climate change a problem that assuming the worst case scenarios are true will result in our grandchildren being much richer than we are instead of muchmuch richer. Set aside for the moment the appalling wastefulness of devoting seven hours seven consecutive hours of prime time programming to the subject. Clearly CNN wanted to make a political statement about how important it thinks climate change ought to be in the election. Good. Given that the United States is the only country in the world that has reduced emissions over the past decade and a half while growing its economy and that the main reason is the growth of hydraulic fracturing fracking which Trump has supported and almost every Democratic candidate promises to ban the only choice is to vote for the Republicans. That is if youreally care about climate change. Otherwise youre just putting party before planet. That wasnt the point CNN wanted to make. Nor was it CNNs goal to expose the ignorance and extremism of the Democratic field. Yet that is exactly what happened. Given 40 minutes apiece the aspiring Democratic contenders showed that they are willing to de industrialize the U.S. economy put millions of people out of work and lower the standard of living for tens of millions more all for the sake of science they cannot explain and do not understand. It wasnt all the candidates fault. CNN kept making scientific claims that ranged from half truths to pure baloney. Again and again for instance moderators suggested that Hurricane Dorian was caused by climate change or a sign of things to come. It isnt. But give the network partial credit for noting that plans like the Green New Deal will hurt mining and agricultural communities. Some of the candidates barely seemed to care. 1. Taxing carbon pollution.Some called it a carbon fee others called it a carbon tax. Former U.S. Rep. Beto ORourke D TX was the only one offering a cap and trade system as an alternative. All believe that you should be paying more for fuel. None suggested making it revenue neutral say by lowering payroll taxes though South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg would redistribute the money to the poor. Learn from California thats not happening. 2. Banning fracking.With the possible exception of former vice president Joe Biden who agreed last month at the second debate that he would eliminate fracking and former HUD Secretary Julin Castro who would back bans at state and local levels all of the Democrats want to ban the one innovation that has made the greatest difference for our planet in the last twenty years powered the economic recovery and made us less dependent on the Mideast. 3. Ending oil and gas exploration and extraction on public lands. The Obama administration tried it too. Never mind that some public lands have been specifically set aside for oil and gas development. There seems to be little thought about the impact that would have on the U.S. economy on fuel prices and on national security. Nor is any credit given for industry advances in environmentally friendly technology except as a warrant for more regulation. 4. Banning nuclear energy. Perhaps with Nevada the fourth state in the 2020 primary contests in mind most of the candidates objected to nuclear energy because of challenges around nuclear waste storage. Only businessman Andrew Yang and Sen. Cory Booker D NJ offered defenses of nuclear power as a zero emissions alternative with Booker making the obvious argument if you believe we need to reduce emissions quickly nuclear is the only way. 5. Banning plastic straws discouraging meat eliminatingincandescent light bulbs.Sen. Kamala Harris D CA admitted that paper straws are useless but wants to ban the plastic ones anyway based on pseudoscience. Booker a vegansays you can eat what you want thanks! but the rest want you to find another source of protein. And the candidates mocked Trump for halting the imposition of energy efficient bulbs seemingly ignorant of health risks. The craziness didnt end there. Biden blamed climate change for the cancer and thegenocide in Darfur previously thought to be the fault of Arab militias slaughtering raping and displacing black African civilians. Buttigieg said he would explain climate change to folks in the heartland by telling them God thought greenhouse gases were a sin. Bernie Sanders suggested global population control encouraged by organizations that promote abortion abroad. They all want to rejoin the Paris Climate Accords none wants to submit them to the Senate for ratification but several want to eliminate or evade the filibuster to pass the Green New Deal the green socialist manifesto written by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D NY. No compromises on the road to utopia. And plenty new material for Trumps campaign ads. Send a receipt to Jeff Zucker and file a form with the FEC.

A total of 10 US national monuments are in the Trump administrations sights to be either resized or repurposed in order to allow activities such as mining logging and grazing within their borders. Environmental groups have vowed legal action to stymie any alterations to the protected areas. Here are the 10 national monuments identified for change by Ryan Zinke the secretary of the interior. Designated in December 2016 by Barack Obama Bears Ears national monument is a 1.35m acre expanse of mesas buttes and Native American archaeological sites that sprawls across south eastern Utah. Its many splendors include a series of stunning rock bridges as well as the aptly named Grand Gulch an intricate canyon system thick with thousand year old ruins. A whopping 1.9m acres south central Utahs Grand Staircase Escalante was set aside by Bill Clinton in 1996 and is the largest terrestrial national monument in the US. It contains a series of gigantic plateaus and cliffs the Grand Staircase as well as a string of deep gorges known as the Escalante River Canyons. The first national monument established solely to protect its rich biodiversity Clinton deemed the Cascade Siskiyou an ecological wonderland when he protected it at about 52000 acres in 2000. In his final week in office Obama responded to calls from local conservationists and scientists and expanded the monument adding approximately 48000 acres. Covering nearly 300000 acres of remote desert north east of Las Vegas the Gold Butte monument was created by Obama in December 2016. Its chiseled red sandstone towers canyons and mountains contain a treasure trove of rock art and are an important habitat for species such as the Mojave desert tortoise bighorn sheep and the mountain lion. Roxanne Quimby co founder of Burts Bees cosmetics and her foundation purchased tracts of land in the northern reaches of Maine with the purpose of creating a national park. When this plan was opposed by various state and federal politicians Obama stepped in to create a 87000 acre national monument dominated by mountains and lush forests. Another Obama creation the marine monument was designated in September 2016 and sits off the New England coast. The area was protected to safeguard an ecosystem of deep sea corals three species of whale and an endangered species of sea turtle the Kemps ridley. A huge monument spanning nearly 500000 acres and proclaimed in May 2014. There are several hundred known archaeological sites in this mountainous stretch of New Mexico including some of the earliest known native American settlements. In the 1960s US astronauts used the area to train for lunar missions. Declared by President George W Bush in 2009 and expanded by Obama in 2014 the monument covers 480000 square miles in marine areas to the south and west of Hawaii. The scattered reserve contains rare birds trees and grasses as well as largely untouched coral reefs. Found at an average elevation of 7000ft this New Mexico monument was created in 2013. The area is riddled with volcanic cones with the Rio Grande flowing through an 800ft gorge in the layers of volcanic basalt flows and ash. The monument has several archaeological sites and is considered a key wildlife corridor for migrating animals. The enormous 8.5m acre monument in the south Pacific was declared by Bush in January 2009. Rare petrels shearwaters and terns are found there as well as giant clams reef sharks and rose coloured corals. It is considered by the Fish Wildlife Service as the most important seabird habitat in the region.	True	True	False	True	True
The permafrost that covers great swaths of Siberia northern Canada Alaska and Greenland is warming twice as fast as other parts of the planet and could be gone by midcentury causing more warming and releasing gigatonnes of carbon dioxide and methane. That has all kind of consequences both locally for this region for the animals and the people who live here as well as globally Max Holmes a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center who is studying the permafrost in Alaska told the New York Times. As global temperatures rise scientists are trying to determine the likely speed and scale of the melting of Alaskas permafrost. In geology permafrost is a thick subsurface layer of soil that remains frozen throughout the year. Located in high latitudes it covers about 24 percent of the land surface in the northern hemisphere and can be up to 1km thick. Some of the permafrost dates back to the last Ice Age. Most of this area is found in Siberia northern Canada Alaska and Greenland. Permafrost is thought to contain about twice as much carbon dioxide and methane as is currently in the atmosphere. When permafrost melts microbes convert carbon to carbon dioxide causing even more warming. Scientists estimate the thawing could contribute as much as 1.7F 1C to global warming over the next several centuries regardless of what nations do to reduce emissions from burning fossil fuels and other activities. Holmes led a team of scientists in July to take permafrost cores sediment and water samples from the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge to better understand how thawing permafrost affects the landscape and how much and what mix of greenhouse gases are released. In order to know how much is lost you have to know how much is there Sue Natali a Woods Hole scientist and permafrost expert told the New York Times. Vladimir Romanovsky a permafrost researcher with the University of Alaska Fairbanks said the temperatures at a depth of 65ft have risen to 5.5F 3C over decades. Minus 3 is not that far from zero Dr. Romanovsky told the New York Times. He estimates that if emissions and warming continue at the same rate near surface temperatures will rise above freezing around the middle of the century. In 2013 the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC projected that temperature increases in Alaska and northern Russia could reduce permafrost by between 37 and 87 percent by the end of this century. If that occurs it could potentially leak 1700 gigatonnes of carbon and methane twice what is already in the atmosphere. A global temperature rise of 2.7F 1.5C above current levels would be enough to start the thawing of the permafrost in Siberia according to scientists from the earth sciences depart at Oxford University in a report published in Science Express in 2016.

At a conservative event in Steamboat Springs Colorado on Friday Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke pounced on the opportunity to blast his critics including the environmental terrorists he blames for wildfires in the West. The left he said is angry intolerant and uninformed when it comes to public lands and environmental issues and they arent interested in debate one of the things that have made America great. They dont want to be informed. They dont want to do the research Zinke said. They go to the same little trough of Kool Aid every day. And they dont want to expand their paradigm and look at the actual facts. On Sunday Zinke traveled to fire ravaged California where he made it abundantly clear that the Trump administration has no interest in the scientific research showing climate change is contributing to the extreme fires raging across the West or that the effect on wildfires is expected to grow as climate change drives up global temperatures and fuels droughts. Ive heard the climate change argument back and forth. This has nothing to do with climate change he told KCRA TV in Sacramento. This has to do with active forest management. It doesnt matter whether you believe or dont believe in climate change he said during another interview this weekend while touring neighborhoods torched by the deadly Carr fire west of Redding California. To be fair Zinke acknowledged that theres no doubt the fire season is getting longer the temperatures are getting hotter as The Sacramento Bee reported. But he didnt dwell on those factors and instead argued for more logging and thinning of forests while taking another swing at environmental groups that he says stand in the way of such efforts. Its true that the accumulation of fuel is among the factors that have contributed to increased fire activity and California is taking additional steps to improve forest health. But a 2016 study found that human caused climate change had doubled the amount of land that burned in Western forests over a 30 year period by significantly drying out vegetation. Thirteen of the states 20 most destructive fires on record have occurred since 2003. Coming in at No. 6 is the Carr fire which has burned more than 200000 acres destroyed 1599 structures and killed seven people including three firefighters. Additionally 15 of the states 20 largest fires have occurred since 2002. The Mendocino Complex fire which has burned nearly 300000 acres north of Santa Rosa surpassed last years Thomas fire as the largest wildfire in Californias history. California is already way ahead of where it was at this time last year both in terms of the number of fires fought and the acreage burned. That a member of President Donald Trumps Cabinet would dismiss the link between climate change and wildfire is par for the course. What makes Zinkes statements during his trip to California so astonishing is that they come two days after he stressed the importance of being informed and open minded. As HuffPost reported last week the administration appears to be using the disaster in California as an opportunity to push partisan policy. While Zinke works the logging angle Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have attempted to connect devastating California wildfires to a longstanding fight between farmers and environmentalists over water resources. The move came just two days after California fire officials dismissed Trumps claims that the fires have been exacerbated by a water shortage resulting from bad environmental laws. As they see it the problem is the one that Zinke and other administration officials refuse to acknowledge.	False	False	False	True	False
U.S. President Donald Trump displays an Executive Order on Offshore Energy Strategy at the White House in Washington U.S. April 28 2017. Photo Kevin LamarqueReuters On the eve of his 100th day in the White House President Trump signed an executive order Friday intended to let energy companies drill for oil in currently protected areas of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. The move was swiftly condemned by environmentalists but Trump hailed it as a victory for the economy. This is a great day for American workers and families. And today were unleashing American energy and clearing the way for thousands and thousands of high paying American energy jobs Trump said before signing the order. So far Trumps energy policies have aimed at reversing the plentiful environmental protections established by his predecessor former President Barack Obama. In the Roosevelt Room of the White House Trump said the United States is blessed with wonderful natural resources including offshore oil and natural gas reserves which can be harnessed to stimulate energy production and job growth. He said the federal government has closed off 94 percent of these offshore areas preventing potential energy production. And when they say closed they mean closed. This deprives our country of potentially thousands and thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in wealth. I pledged to take action and today I am keeping that promise he said. Trumps signing of the America First Offshore Energy Strategy comes a day before the Peoples Climate March an international protest against Trumps energy and environmental policies. The flagship march in Washington D.C. and the more than 300 affiliated marchers across the globe are expected to draw thousands. Though similar to last weeks March for Science the march on Saturday will focus on Trumps efforts to remove regulations intended to protect the environment and curb climate change rather than scientific integrity. According to Trump the new executive order begins the process of opening many offshore areas to job creating energy exploration and rescinds the Obama administrations permanent protection of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. A month before leaving office Obama banned offshore drilling in nearly all of the Arctic under U.S. control to protect marine life and prevent potential oil spills. He also declared portions of the Atlantic Ocean unsuitable for drilling. Obama relied upon a little known 1953 law that allows the president to ban oil and gas drilling indefinitely in U.S. waters. At the time an Obama administration official suggested that Trump would not be able to reverse the ban without an act from Congress because of its strong legal basis. On Thursday night Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke briefed the press on the contents of the executive order. He said it would direct the Interior and Commerce Departments to review offshore drilling and gas regulations in protected areas. As expected the response to Trumps executive order from the environmental community was swift and harsh. Michael Brune executive director of the Sierra Club released a statement saying that millions of Americans concerned about the dangers of offshore drilling will not be drowned out regardless of the oil lobbys influence over Trump. Just as he has throughout his 99 days in office Donald Trump will fail in this attempt to destroy our beaches and coastal communities. The people have been heard and will continue to be heard Brune said. Greenpeace USAs senior climate and energy campaigner Diana Best also released a statement condemning Trumps executive order. She said that renewable energy has already set the U.S. on course for energy independence and that offshore oil and gas drilling will condemn the nation to decades more of pollution. This executive order from the Trump administration is just the latest in a series of attempted rollbacks that most people in this country do not want and only come at the behest of Trumps inner circle of desperate fossil fuel executives Best said. Holing up at Mar a lago may protect Trump from an oil spill but it will not protect him and his cabinet of onepercenters from the millions of people in this country from California to North Carolina who will resist his disastrous policies.

The progressive Democratic newcomer from New York joined more than 100 environmental youth activists on Tuesday for a sit in inside House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosis Capitol Hill office to encourage a deal to transition to a 100 percent renewable energy based economy to fight climate change. The demonstration took place the same day that new members of Congress including Ocasio Cortez arrived for orientation. They asked me to join them and I did Ocasio Cortez tweeted of her involvement with members of the Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats who visited several elected officials offices in the building. We can embrace the energy of activism to move our partys goals forward. Pelosis office in a statement shared by Ocasio Cortez on Twitter expressed support for the activists and said that she has recommended reinstating the Select Committee on Climate Change a special climate change committee that was dissolved by Republicans in 2011. House Democrats ran on and won on our bold campaign for a 1 trillion investment in our infrastructure that will make our communities more resilient to the climate crisis while creating 16 million new good paying jobs across the country Pelosis statement read. We welcome the presence of these activists and we strongly urge the Capitol Police to allow them to continue to organize and participate in our democracy. California is burning. Fossil fuel billionaires have a grip on America's democracy. We're running out of time to act. But we're going to win. We'll pass a win the solutions we need. We'll win because we have a movement behind us. And together we're unstoppable. pic.twitter.commw6dKSxPVj 350 dot org November 13 2018 Members of the Sunrise Movement responding to Pelosis support in their ownstatement on Twitter said they welcomed her endorsement but added that words arent enough. The group urged her to step aside if she is unable to mandate such a plan. Ocasio Cortez added that she supports Pelosi reinstating the Select Committee and highlighted the activists requests that the committee draft a Green New Deal calling for 100 percent renewable energy and a commitment from the committees appointed members that they wont accept funding from the fossil fuel industry.

WASHINGTON President Trump'slatest effort to boost the nation's manufacturing sector is an industry friendly rewrite of air quality regulations he says pose unnecessary and outdated barriers to growth. But environmental advocates warn it would be another damaging step by an administration obsessed withderegulation at the expense of hard fought public health protections. The proposed loosening of air quality standards came in the form of a directive Trump issued Thursday instructing the EPA towork with states that have metro areas which failed to attain clean air standards. The president's primary aim the directive states is promoting domestic manufacturing and job creation. Dozens of communities across the country fail to meet Clean Air Act standards for at least one of six key pollutantsground level ozone smog particulate matter soot or smoke carbon monoxide lead sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide according to the EPA. Building or expanding major projects such as highways and manufacturing plants in these non attainment areas requires extra time and cost to make sure the increased industrial activity won't worsen air quality. And states with non attainment areas have to file plans with the EPA to show how they're confronting the problem a review process that can take years. Trump's directive orders the EPA to work with states to expedite those approvals and instructs the agency to consider whether the current process should be revised or rescinded ...to provide states with additional implementation flexibility. These actions are intended to ensure that EPA carries out its core missions of protecting the environment and improving air quality in accord with statutory requirements while reducing unnecessary impediments to new manufacturing and business expansion essential for a growing economy the presidentsaid in a statement accompanying the order. Read More Assailed as tool of industry EPA administrator Pruitt affirms importance of science Read More Exclusive EPA's Pruitt vows to continue rolling back rules despite alarming climate report Read More Scott Pruitt on a mission to change the climate of the EPA The directive comes at a time when the EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has been under increasing bipartisan fire on Capitol Hill for a number of management missteps spending decisions and potential ethical conflicts. The president has staunchly defended Pruitt largely because Trump and his conservative allies applaud how aggressively the EPA is rolling back regulations and promoting economic growth. In the 14 months he's been the nation's top environmental rulemaker the former Oklahoma attorney general who sued the EPA more than a dozen times has rolled back the Clean Power Plan rescinded the Waters of the U.S. rule and helped convince the president to back out of the Paris Accord on climate change among a number of changes. And Trump's vow to bring back coal important in mining states like West Virginia where he just visitedhave been buoyed by Pruitt's actions. The air quality directive doesnt instruct the EPA to revise the air quality standards themselves. Instead environmental advocates worry the administration would try to circumvent clean air standards without congressional say so by pursuing steps that could make it easier for industry to meet current regulations without being required to improve the quality of the air Americans beatheevery day. One of those steps they say would allow states to expand the size of non attainment areas to include areas with cleaner air so that overall pollutant levels meet environmental standards. Another would permit the EPA to discount many studies used as the basis for air quality standards for a lack of transparency because those analyses use individual health datathat cant be disclosed because they're protected under federal privacy laws. This is a backhanded way of weakening the most important and sacrosanct provision of theclean Air Act and he's nodoing it through any normal legislative process said Bill Becker former executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies which represents state regulators. Trumps action empowers Pruitt to ignore science and data in determining compliance with air quality standards saidSara JordanLegislative Representative for the League of Conservation Voters. By directing the EPA to reconsider all of its past guidance from the federal air quality program Trump is threatening clean air protections for cities across the country she said. This is yet another example of this administration selling out our future to industry polluters. Industry representatives say the maze of federal rules governing a slew of environmental and health standards are unnecessary and burdensome. If states had more wiggle room in how they measure and apply air quality standards thousandsof jobs could be created they said. Over the years regulations on air quality have become so complicated that it can be nearly impossible for manufacturers to secure the needed approvals just to open a new facility said Ross Eisenberg Vice President for Energy and Resources Policy with the NationalAssociation of Manufacturers. EPA officials point out that much progress has been made on air quality in recent decades.Levels of Nitrogen Dioxide NOx for example have dropped by more than 50 percent since 2000. There are no monitors in the U.S. currently measuring pollution above those standards. The order encourages federal and state regulators to speed up reviews of air quality permits echoing Trump's call for quicker approvals involving infrastructure projects such as bridges roads and pipelines. But Beckersaid that comes off as a hollow demand considering the president's budget calls for significant cuts in EPA personnel and state environmental grants that help pay for such reviews. One of the most troubling aspects of Trump's order is that it's directing an agency established to reduce pollution to make job creation an expresspriority saidJohn Walke director of theNatural Resources Defense Council's clean air program. The memo encourages reliance on air pollution modeling for deregulatory purposes or permits desired by industry but not for regulatory purposes that would better protect Americans he said.

Reuters U.S. presidential candidate Beto ORourke on Monday laid out one of the most detailed climate policies so far in the crowded Democratic field calling for a 5 trillion investment in clean energy technology and infrastructure over 10 years with a goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. ORourke the former Texas congressman made climate change the focus of his first major policy announcement unveiling the plan ahead of a campaign stop meeting with scientists at the iconic Yosemite National Park in California. The greatest threat we face which will test our country our democracy every single one of us is climate change ORourke said in a statement. The plan lays out a series of executive actions that would reverse the energy dominance policies of President Donald Trump who has been rolling back environmental regulation to increase domestic fossil fuels production. ORourkes measures include U.S. re entry into the Paris Climate Agreement ordering a reduction in methane emissions from oil and gas operations halting new drilling leases on federal land and restoring pollution standards for power plants. His plan also calls for raising taxes on the wealthy and on corporations to help fund some 5 trillion in projects to modernize infrastructure and clean energy technology over a decade. The net zero goal in ORourkes and other climate plans means reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions 100 percent or offsetting them by as much as is emitted. The bill will be funded with the revenues generated by structural changes to the tax code that ensure corporations and the wealthiest among us pay their fair share and that we finally end the tens of billions of dollars of tax breaks currently given to fossil fuel companies ORourkes legislative proposal states. The plan appears to align with some of the principles of the Green New Deal a bold set of policy goals introduced by congressional Democrats that would transform the U.S. energy economy to 100 percent renewable sources by 2030 using federal funds to invest in modern infrastructure and green job programs. Most of the Democratic presidential candidates including Bernie Sanders Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren have embraced the Green New Deal which has become a focus of attacks by the Republican party which calls it unfeasible. Other candidates have announced some specific policy measures related to climate change and the environment in recent weeks and Warren has unveiled a public lands policy that would ban new drilling and mining leases on federal lands. Environmental group the League of Conservation Voters on Monday praised ORourkes plan saying that it offered the kind of leadership we need from the next president. Still the upstart Sunrise Movement the youth led group that has pushed the Green New Deal into the spotlight said ORourkes plan fell short of what they said scientists said was necessary to fend off the worst impacts of climate change. The Green New Deal calls for achieving net zero emissions within a decade not by mid century as ORourkes plan sets out. Beto claims to support the Green New Deal but his plan is out of line with the timeline it lays out and the scale of action that scientists say is necessary to take here in the United States to give our generation a livable future said Sunrise founder Varshini Prakash.

Virginia Del. Lashrecse Aird D If elected Virginia Del. Lashrecse Aird D would be the states first female speaker of the House and the first Black person to lead the legislative body. You have in my opinion a Commonwealth that wants to see that. You have members who have been in our caucus and who will be coming into our caucus that want to see that happen she added. I strongly believe that the other individuals in this race their personal politics has never been about bold progressive leadership so why are they going to start now because they receive a new title? Now the monopolies critics fear that the companies which extract fossil fuels and generate energy in addition to transmitting it will seek to water down any efforts to combat climate change. To the extent that Democrats pass legislation mandating more renewable energy use antitrust crusaders inside and outside the legislature fear that Dominion and Appalachian will try to monopolize production of those new energy sources as well. Having gender equality public safety LGBTQ equality gun safety those are the things we should be able to accomplish regardless of whos in charge Only taking care of those things is such a cheap cop out for what a party should stand for. I want to go beyond those issues said Del. Mark Keam a Fairfax County Democrat who would not say how he plans to vote in the leadership race. How do you change infrastructure so we run on clean energy rather than fossil fuels? We need to get there by breaking down monopolies and increasing competition. Aird is pitching her Democratic colleagues on not only the vision of a more ambitious legislative agenda but also on granting rank and file House Democrats more opportunities to shape caucus priorities. On Friday she released a 14 page report 60 Day Plan for a Stronger Commonwealth outlining her proposals which include the creation of new leadership posts and a new committee dedicated to energy and natural resources. That committee Aird acknowledged would enable the House to take a proactive role in oversight of the states utility monopolies. I feel like I have one foot in the old world and one foot in the new world to lead some of the new folks that came in in 2017 and will be coming in this year she said. I will take a balanced approach to governing.	False	False	False	True	True
Staff at the US Department of Agriculture USDA have been told to avoid using the term climate change in their work with the officials instructed to reference weather extremes instead. A series of emails obtained by the Guardian between staff at the Natural Resources Conservation Service NRCS a USDA unit that oversees farmers land conservation show that the incoming Trump administration has had a stark impact on the language used by some federal employees around climate change. A missive from Bianca Moebius Clune director of soil health lists terms that should be avoided by staff and those that should replace them. Climate change is in the avoid category to be replaced by weather extremes. Instead of climate change adaption staff are asked to use resilience to weather extremes. The primary cause of human driven climate change is also targeted with the term reduce greenhouse gases blacklisted in favor of build soil organic matter increase nutrient use efficiency. Meanwhile sequester carbon is ruled out and replaced by build soil organic matter. In her email to staff dated 16 February this year Moebius Clune said the new language was given to her staff and suggests it be passed on. She writes that we wont change the modeling just how we talk about it there are a lot of benefits to putting carbon back in the sail sic climate mitigation is just one of them and that a colleague from USDAs public affairs team gave advice to tamp down on discretionary messaging right now. In contrast to these newly contentious climate terms Moebius Clune wrote that references to economic growth emerging business opportunities in the rural US agro tourism and improved aesthetics should be tolerated if not appreciated by all. In a separate email to senior employees on 24 January just days after Trumps inauguration Jimmy Bramblett deputy chief for programs at the NRCS said It has become clear one of the previous administrations priority is not consistent with that of the incoming administration. Namely that priority is climate change. Please visit with your staff and make them aware of this shift in perspective within the executive branch. Bramblett added that prudence should be used when discussing greenhouse gases and said the agencys work on air quality regarding these gases could be discontinued. Other emails show the often agonized discussions between staff unsure of what is forbidden. On 16 February a staffer named Tim Hafner write to Bramblett I would like to know correct terms I should use instead of climate changes and anything to do with carbon ... I want to ensure to incorporate correct terminology that the agency has approved to use. On 5 April Suzanne Baker a New York based NRCS employee emailed a query as to whether staff are allowed to publish work from outside the USDA that use climate change. A colleague advises that the issue be determined in a phone call. Some staff werent enamored with the new regime with one employee stating on an email on 5 July that we would prefer to keep the language as is and stressing the need to maintain the scientific integrity of the work. In a statement USDA said that on 23 January it had issued interim operating procedures outlining procedures to ensure the new policy team has an opportunity to review policy related statements legislation budgets and regulations prior to issuance. The statement added This guidance similar to procedures issued by previous administrations was misinterpreted by some to cover data and scientific publications. This was never the case and USDA interim procedures will allow complete objective information for the new policy staff reviewing policy decisions. Kaveh Sadeghzadeh of the Natural Resources Conservation Service added that his organisation has not received direction from USDA or the administration to modify its communications on climate change or any other topic. Trump has repeatedly questioned the veracity of climate change research infamously suggesting that it is part of an elaborate Chinese hoax. The president has started the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris climate agreement has instructed the Environmental Protection Agency EPA to scrap or amend various regulations aimed at cutting greenhouse gases and has moved to open up more public land and waters to fossil fuel activity. The nomenclature of the federal government has also shifted as these new priorities have taken hold. Mentions of the dangers of climate change have been removed from the websites of the White House and the Department of the Interior while the EPA scrapped its entire online climate section in April pending a review that will be updating language to reflect the approach of new leadership. These records reveal Trumps active censorship of science in the name of his political agenda said Meg Townsend open government attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. To think that federal agency staff who report about the air water and soil that sustains the health of our nation must conform their reporting with the Trump administrations anti science rhetoric is appalling and dangerous for America and the greater global community. The Center for Biological Diversity is currently suing several government agencies including the EPA and state department to force them to release information on the censoring of climate change verbiage. While some of the changes to government websites may have occurred anyway the emails from within the USDA are the clearest indication yet that staff have been instructed to steer clear of acknowledging climate change or its myriad consequences. US agriculture is a major source of heat trapping gases with 15 of the countrys emissions deriving from farming practices. A USDA plan to address the far reaching impacts of climate change is still online. However Sam Clovis Trumps nomination to be the USDAs chief scientist has labeled climate research junk science. Last week it was revealed that Clovis who is not a scientist once ran a blog where he called progressives race traders and race traitors and likened Barack Obama to a communist.

Virginias efforts to fight climate change got a big boost after Tuesdays election with Democrats flipping both chambers of the states General Assembly. As part of its pre election platform Virginias Democratic party unanimously endorsed two major progressive environmental resolutions They voted in favor of setting a target of net zero carbon emissions for the state by 2050 and they endorsed the Green New Deal Virginia. Like the Green New Deal resolution introduced in the US Congress Virginias version aims to move the state to 100 percent renewable energy while pursuing social welfare programs like job retraining for workers who would lose their jobs in the transition. Climate change isnt a far off issue for Virginians so its not surprising that some were thinking about it at the ballot box. Many are already starting to feel the effects of the melting ice and warming oceans that result from rising average temperatures. The Hampton Roads region for example is facing the highest rate of sea level rise on the East Coast. Rising waters are worsening the impacts of tropical storms that strike the state and will cost Virginia cities billions of dollars in losses in the coming decades. Thats why Tuesdays results are a big deal for Virginia voters who want the state to do more to limit climate change. The new Democratic legislative majority could also allow Gov. Ralph Northam to fulfill his long thwarted ambition of bringing Virginia into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative RGGI a compact among nine East Coast states to cap and trade greenhouse gas emissions credits. Northam had failed to get the Republican led legislature on board with his climate goals but he signed an executive order in September mandating that Virginia generate 30 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2030 and generate all power from non carbon emitting sources by 2050. Joining RGGI would be a key way to finance this transition toward cleaner energy with revenue coming from auctioning off carbon credits. Virginias Democratic Party also said that it would refuse contributions from energy providers like Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power that generate power from fossil fuels. Its part of a national campaign from environmental activists to push public officials to say no to money from the coal oil and natural gas industries. Yet in many key races Democrats still out raised their Republican opponents. But the test of these election promises will be in how theyre implemented. Virginia gets 53 percent of its electricity from natural gas and 10 percent from coal so its a long uphill walk to zero emissions. Virginia is just the latest state where limiting climate change has proved to be a winning issue The election results also show yet again that Democrats can campaign and win on aggressive action on climate change. And they illustrate that despite high profile criticism from Republicans the Green New Deal is proving to be popular with many voters even in local elections. Ahead of the election polls showed that more than 60 percent of Virginians wanted their government to do more about climate change. Young Virginia voters said climate change was a top tier concern. Candidates like Joshua Cole who won the election for Virginias 28th House District campaigned on environmental action including upgrading infrastructure to make it more resilient and deploying clean energy. With Congress deadlocked and President Donald Trump pulling the United States out of the Paris climate agreement Virginias election also highlights how the biggest opportunities to curb greenhouse gases are occurring at the state level. States like Oregon New Mexico Colorado and Nevada are already locking in more stringent limits on greenhouse gases and setting higher targets for deploying clean energy. And almost every Democrat running for the White House in 2020 wants to ramp up action on climate change should any of them take office. So climate change is likely to remain a key campaign issue for Democrats in the coming elections.	True	True	False	True	True
PORTO VELHO Brazil Lingering smoke in the Amazon caused concern Tuesday among Brazilians who say that respiratory problems particularly among children and the elderly have increased as fires in the region rage. The kids are affected the most. Theyre coughing a lot said Elane Diaz a nurse in the Rondonia state capital of Porto Velho as she waited for a doctors appointment at the citys 9 of July hospital with her 5 year old son Eduardo. They have problems breathing. Im concerned because it affects their health. The number of people treated for respiratory issues increased sharply in recent days at the local Cosme e Damia Childrens hospital. This period has been very tough. The dry weather and the smoke causes many problems on children such as pneumonia coughing and secretion Daniel Pires a pediatrician and the hospitals adjunct director told the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper. From Aug. 1 to Aug. 10 the median number of cases was about 120 to 130 children with respiratory problems. From Aug. 11 to Aug. 20 it went up to 280 cases. Amazon fires What would the Earth be like without the Amazon rainforest? Growing fears over the health impacts are emerging as the number of fires in Brazil surges with more than 77000 documented by the countrys National Space Research Institute in the last year. About half of the fires occurred in the Amazon region with most in the past month. But as breathing related ailments appear to be on the rise attention to the issue has largely been overshadowed by growingacrimony between Brazil and European countries seeking to help fight Amazon fires and protect a region seen as vital to the health of the planet. At a summit in France this week G 7 nations pledged to help fight the flames and protect the rainforest by offering 20 million in addition to a separate 12 million from Britain and 11 million from Canada. But Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro a far right climate skeptic who took office this year with a promise to boost development in Latin Americas biggest economy questioned whether offers of international aid mask a plot to exploit the Amazons resources and weaken Brazilian growth. On Tuesday he said that his French counterpart President Emmanuel Macron had called him a liar and would have to apologize before Brazil considers accepting rainforest aid. Macron has to retract those comments and then we can speak Bolsonaro said. In a video message Brazilian novelist Paulo Coelho offered an apology to France for what he called Bolsonaros hysteria saying the Brazilian government had resorted to insults to dodge responsibility for the Amazon fires. Meanwhile within Brazil a number of people said they supported Bolsonaro despite local and international criticism of his handling of the crisis exposing a divide that has split the country. Grace Quale a hospital laboratory technician who attended a service at an evangelical church on Sunday said that critics want to overthrow our president and that she didnt see a link between Bolsonaros environmental policies and the number of people getting treatment for respiratory problems. Mona Lisa Pereira an agronomist also said criticism of Brazils government was skewed. Germany had already been helping through NGOs and they couldnt prevent this Pereira said. It seems like this is the fire of a lifetime. But its not. We have fires every year. Others said in an open letter that the governments discourse and measures are leading to a collapse in federal environmental management and stimulate environmental crimes inside and outside the Amazon. More than 500 employees from the environmental regulator IBAMA signed the letter and included a list of emergency measures they recommended including more qualified management and employees and a greater budget and increased autonomy. The Amazon has experienced an increased rate of fires during drought periods in the last 20 years but the phenomenon this year is unusual because drought has not yet hit said Laura Schneider of Rutgers University New Brunswick. Schneider an associate professor in the geography department said fire is commonly used by people to clear land for cultivation and the actual area burned this year must be measured for an accurate comparison with damage in past years. While many of the recorded fires this year were set in already deforested areas by people clearing land for cultivation or pasture Brazil government figures show that they are much more widespread this year suggesting the threat to the vast Amazon ecosystem is intensifying. But for now more immediate consequences of the raging flames were becoming clear. The worlds largest rainforest is a major absorber of carbon dioxide considered a critical defense against rising temperatures and other disruptions caused by climate change. The government in the Amazonian state of Rondonia has warned that the burning of land can produce smoke that can greatly influence atmospheric pollution putting the life of many at risk. Experts there said that when exposed to smoke residents can suffer from rhinitis sinus and respiratory problems like asthma and bronchitis while chronic exposure can also lead to pulmonary illnesses including lung emphysema. Weve seen that Porto Velho has been taken over by smoke so inhaling those antigens and pathogens can harm the whole citys population Ana Carolina Terra Cruz a specialist in pulmonary illnesses told the state government website. Deep ramifications Trump would cost General Motors billions if he actually orders business out of China On Tuesday some clouds and a blue sky were partly visible in the Porto Velho morning light. But by the afternoon haze had again settled with smoke so thick that it darkened the usually blazing sun. Pereira the agronomist said that smoke was everywhere. Its bad for everyone she said. Not just our children.	True	True	False	True	False
Fans of Greta Thunberg have expressed relief after the 16 year old posted a string of smiling photographs on Instagram. The environmental activist's recent images taken while touring Canada's east coast in Montreal and Quebec are in sharp contrast to images of the 16 year old speaking in an emotionally charged appearance last month at the Climate Action Summit 2019 in New York. A photo of Greta scowling when she spotted Donald Trump went viral. The teenage campaigner who has 7.2million followers on Instagram looks decidedly happier since she crossed the border from the US something which her followers haven't failed to notice. Writing on Instagram Greta said 'So happy to say that the following weeks I'll travel slowly through the North American continent moving southwest and then eventually through South America towards Santiago. I will stop on the way and visit as many places as I can and of course protest every Friday no matter where I am.' Yesterday the teenager posted an image of herself at the Marine Mammal Interpretation Centre in Tadoussac Qubec after spending a morning watching whales. The tone of Greta's images have changed significantly since she addressed the United Nations Climate Summit on September 23rd where she came close to tears in a emotional speech to international delegates. She told them 'I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us for hope. How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words' During the same appearance Greta was seen at the UN headquarters with an enraged expression on her face as US President Donald Trump upstaged her entrance by walking in flanked by news reporters an image that promptly went viral. Among the comments posted by the environmentalist's followers many remarked how much happier the teenager had looked in recent days. On Instagram Jesuissuzette wrote 'Greta you look so much happier now that youre out of America. Enjoy your travels. And thank you for your intrepid Climate Crisis campaign.' Last week Thunberg addressed on social media the negativity she's received for speaking out on climate change saying 'Here we go again... As you may have noticed the haters are as active as ever going after me my looks my clothes my behaviour and my differences. They come up with every thinkable lie and conspiracy theory. It seems they will cross every possible line to avert the focus since they are so desperate not to talk about the climate and ecological crisis. Being different is not an illness and the current best available science is not opinions its facts.' Greta who is taking a sabbatical year from school arrived in North America in August taking a two week crossing on carbon neutral yacht Malizia II to address the United Nations. Greta Thunberg's fiery speech at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York This is all wrong. I shouldnt be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to me for hope? How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet Im one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you! For more than 30 years the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you are doing enough when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight. You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency. But no matter how sad and angry I am I dont want to believe that. Because if you fully understood the situation and still kept on failing to act then you would be evil. And I refuse to believe that. The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50 chance of staying below 1.5C degrees and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control. Maybe 50 is acceptable to you. But those numbers dont include tipping points most feedback loops additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution or the aspects of justice and equity. They also rely on my and my childrens generation sucking hundreds of billions of tonnes of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist. So a 50 risk is simply not acceptable to us we who have to live with the consequences. To have a 67 chance of staying below a 1.5C global temperature rise the best odds given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the world had 420 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide left to emit back on 1 January 2018. Today that figure is already down to less than 350 gigatonnes. How dare you pretend that this can be solved with business as usual and some technical solutions. With todays emissions levels that remaining CO2 budget will be entirely gone in less than eight and a half years. There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures today. Because these numbers are too uncomfortable. And you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is. You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming whether you like it or not.	False	True	False	True	True
The US will consider its interests first as it reviews its climate change policy the secretary of state says. Rex Tillerson told a meeting of the eight Arctic nations in Alaska that the US would not rush to make a decision and would consider their views. President Donald Trump has expressed doubts over the human role in climate change and has said he may pull the US out of the Paris Accord to fight it. Meanwhile other Arctic countries have called for a cut on greenhouse gases. They signed an agreement which stated there was a need for urgent global action. Climate change was the biggest issue at the biennial meeting of the Arctic Council in Fairbanks which was overshadowed by the uncertainties over Mr Trump's policy. Mr Tillerson the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil told the meeting that the administration was reviewing how it would approach climate change. We are appreciative that each of you has an important point of view and you should know that we are taking the time to understand your concerns he said. We're not going to rush to make a decision. We're going to work to make the right decision for the United States. Mr Trump is to decide whether the US will leave or reduce its commitments to the Paris agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which was negotiated by around 200 nations and signed in 2015. An announcement is expected after a trip to Europe later this month. The joint agreement by the Arctic Council mentioned the Paris accord only in a passing reference which noted the deal's entry into force and implementation. But the text did not recommit its members to meet the pledges made. Some climate scientists here in Alaska say they are pleasantly surprised by the relatively tough language on climate change adopted by all eight Arctic Council nations including the United States. The thrust of the text argues Prof John Walsh chief scientist at the University of Alaska's International Arctic Research Center actually echoes the approach of the Obama administration. The acceptance of the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide and pollutants like black carbon and aerosols appears significant. But a couple of things are missing. Although the logic of the statement insists that human activity is causing climate change the word human is not actually present. Nor is there a commitment to implement the landmark Paris accord an omission which is causing alarm among environmentalists. Not only that but many of the Trump administration's early policy decisions prioritised economic growth over environmental protection and Mr Tillerson continues to insist that American climate policy remains under review. So in short it is far too early to conclude that the White House has suddenly been persuaded by mainstream scientific opinion on global warming and with US politics in astonishing flux the Fairbanks Declaration may be no more than a holding statement.

These devastating images show an indigenous family surveying the ruins of their homeland in the Amazon rainforest. Surrounded by dry soil and fallen timber their native land has been all but destroyed by rapid deforestation. During the day the usually fierce sun is obscured by a thick grey smoke caused by deliberately lit wildfires that are raging out of control across Brazil. The smell is of barbecue caused by vast swathes of the worlds largest tropical rainforest going up in flames. Raimundo Mura indigenous leader with the Mura tribe who live in a reserve near Humaita Amazonas state said For the forest I will go on until my last drop of blood. All the trees had lives they all needed to live each in their own place. For us this is destruction. What is being done here is an atrocity against us. The rainforest is home to some one million indigenous people and three million species of plants and animals. But it is being decimated at record rates burnt or cleared for farming and mining. Scientists have recorded more than 74000 fires in Brazil this year an 84 increase compared to the same period last year. They can now be seen from space and have plunged the largest city Sao Paulo into darkness because of the heavy smoke. In total the blazes have created a layer of smoke estimated to be 1.2 million square miles wide that spreads across Latin America to the Atlantic coast. Handech Wakana Mura another local leader within the forest said With each passing day we see the destruction advance deforestation invasion and logging. We are sad because the forest is dying at every moment. We feel the climate changing and the world needs the forest. We need the forest and our children need the forest. Environmentalists and academics have blamed the Brazilian government under far right President Jair Bolsonaro for a sharp increase in Amazon deforestation. The climate change sceptic swept to power in January promising to open up the Amazon to mining and farming. His rhetoric is said to have emboldened farmers to burn large sections of the rainforest for beef and soy production. Camila Veiga of the Brazilian Association of NGOs said The fires are the consequence of a policy of environmental devastation of support for agribusiness of increasing pastures. The fires have been raging for around three weeks and an area the size of a football pitch is said to be lost every minute. Global concern is growing as the rainforest is key to tackling global warming because of the way it absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen. Mr Bolsonaro largely ignored the issue at first and even attempted to blame environmental charities accusing them of lighting the fires. Opposition MPs have said the raging infernos are a crime against humanity and blamed his policies for fuelling the blazes. French President Emmanuel Macron had called the wildfires an international crisis and said the leaders of the G7 group of nations should hold urgent discussions about them during their summit in France this weekend. Mr Macron tweeted Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rain forest the lungs which produces 20 of our planets oxygen is on fire. Mr Bolsonaro hit back at Macron complaining he was the subject of a smear campaign and the media had exploited the fires to undermine his government. His chief of staff Onyx Lorenzoni also accused European countries of exaggerating environmental problems in Brazil in order to disrupt its commercial interests. Relations between Europe and Brazil are at a low which has worried the powerful agriculture sector. Last week Norway joined Germany in halting 60 million worth of Amazon protection subsidies accusing Brazil of turning its back on the fight against deforestation. French and German leaders have also threatened not to ratify a trade deal between the European Union and Mercosur countries Argentina Brazil Paraguay and Uruguay to pressure Brazil into complying with its environmental pledges within the Paris Climate Agreement. In contrast the UK is currently on a trade mission in Brazil attempting to forge closer ties post Brexit. The neighbouring country of Bolivia is also struggling with wildfires many believed to have been set by farmers clearing land for cultivation.	False	False	False	True	False
Nearly 10000 farmers and ranchers are endorsing the Green New Deal as the climate policy battleground expands from the oil fields to the agricultural fields. In a letter sent to Congresson Wednesday morning the newly formed bipartisan coalition U.S. Farmers Ranchers for a Green New Deal threw its weight behind the sweeping industrial plan outlined in a resolution that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D N.Y. proposed in February. But zeroing out the countrys planet heating emissions by mid century requires a transformation in agriculture as dramatic as shifting the energy sector away from fossil fuels the letter says. We believe these climate goals are achievable the letter argues but only if the GND includes policies that spur two large scale transitions the transition away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy alternatives and the transition away from industrial agriculture toward family farm based organic and regenerative farming and land use practices that improve soil health and draw down and sequester carbon. The letter was signed by more than 500 individual farms and 50 organizations representing close to 10000 members. Regeneration International a sustainable farming nonprofit organized the missive with the climate justice group Sunrise Movement. It also hosted a Wednesday morning press conference in Washington. A month ago the United Nations released a dire new report urging major changes to food production and land management and warning that emissions cuts alone will fall short of halting catastrophic global warming. Taking cues from those pushing for a Green New Deal several Democratic presidential hopefuls have made farming practices central to their climate proposals. Sen. Bernie Sanders I Vt. earmarked 410 billion in his Green New Deal proposal to help farms of all sizes transition to ecologically regenerative agricultural practices. Sen. Elizabeth Warren D Mass. called for breaking up agriculture monopolies as part of her broad rural platform. South Bend Indiana MayorPete Buttigieg vowed to support farmers by paying them to capture carbon. Yet even as farmers reel from the effects of President Donald Trumps trade war with China Democratic candidates are far from guaranteed their votes. Farmers supported the Trump administrations proposal last week tofinalize the rollback of the Obama era Waters of the U.S. rule which had put new restrictions on which waterways agribusiness could pollute. Early on Republican opposition to the Green New Deal itself coalesced around the idea that such a program would ban beef production although supporters have clearly said it would not. We call on Congress to put the Green in the Green New Deal Wednesdays letter reads by empowering us to revitalize the health and economic security of this countrys middle class to make family farming economically viable again and to help reverse climate change and improve Americas air and water quality by making our ecosystems healthy again.

Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz unveiled the Green Real Deal on Wednesday as a free market counterproposal to the Green New Deal being pushed by Democratsto combat climate change. The question for America is pretty simple either we want a bunch of bureaucrats in Washington telling us what we cant do or we empower American innovators to unlock things that we can do the Florida congressman said at a press conference in front of the Capitol building. AOC MOCKS CRITICS OF GREEN NEW DEAL'S ESTIMATED 93 TRILLION PRICE TAG 'THEY SOUND LIKE DR. EVIL' His plan which he is putting forward in a House resolutioninvolves a number of planks including revisitingglobal trade and intellectual property policies to create an international marketplace fair to American innovators. Gaetz's planalso aims to modernize the electric grid which he says currently functions as a wet blanket over American innovation. Gaetz claims that upgrading the grid will create an entire class of energy entrepreneurs across the country. He also wants to unlock federal lands from current regulations saying they can be an open canvas for renewable energy research testing and evaluation. The plan comes in response to the Green New Deal a once fringe policy that seeks to overhaul the nations economy and energy use to combat climate change and combat income inequality. But this year it has emerged in the Democratic mainstream with a resolution introduced in the House and support from most major 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. However a test vote on the proposal recently failed in the Senate with no senator voting to begin debate on the legislation. The proposalincludes a host of costly and controversial big government programs including a push for net zero greenhouse gas emissions universal health care andjob guarantee programs. In the press conference Gaetz made references to FAQs released by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortezs D N.Y. office that said the deal aims to upgrade or replace every building for energy efficiency and render air travel unnecessary while joking about getting rid of farting cows. Do we really believe that if we outlaw cars cows planes and buildings that the rest of the world will follow? he said. Of course not they will laugh at us. While Gaetzs proposal consists of free market and small government ideas of the kind Republicans have long embraced the plan is a notable shift for the party towardtackling climate change in some fashion. Traditionally Republicans have been more skeptical about mans influence on the climate. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler was asked in January at his confirmation hearing if he believed warnings from scientists about the threats of climate change. I would not call it the greatest crisis no he said. In an indication of likely conservative opposition to Gaetz'splan advocacy group FreedomWorks issued a statement calling it a sad example of Republicans thinking theyre conservatives by being slightly to the right of far left. Whats more it is presented as a collection of bold new ideas yet most of them are policies and programs that exist and arent working. This is perhaps the only thing real about the Green Real Deal' the statement said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Gaetzsaid at the press conference that he doesn't think the EPA has done a good job of combating climate change and said he wants to shift the debate among Republicans from focusing on theexistence of climate change to how to combat it. I didn't come to Congress to argue with a thermometer and I think that more of my colleagues need to realize that the science of global warming is irrefutable he said.	True	False	False	False	True
HuffPost has obtained a list of prominent climate deniers that the Heartland Institute a right wing think tank assembled and submitted to the agency in May. The Illinois based group which hasties to the fossil fuel billionaires who run Koch Industries boasted in July that the White House reached out for help identifying scientists for these debates. This appears to be the list the Heartland Institute provided. The names included on the list suggest that the Heartland Institute wants the debate to go directly after the scientific and legal underpinnings of the EPAs regulations on climate change. Rather than debating the regulatory approaches they want to undermine the conclusion that climate change is a real problem. But while Trump and Pruitt have begun rolling back regulations on greenhouse gas emissions so far they have not attempted to undo the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases pose a threat to human health and the environment a conclusion known as the endangerment finding. It was the EPA under George W. Bush that first made that determination in response to a 2007 Supreme Court ruling but it never acted on that finding. The Obama EPA did and once that conclusion was reached the agency was required by law to issue regulations under the Clean Air Act. Ninety seven percent of peer reviewed research agrees with the conclusion that burning fossil fuels deforestation and industrial farms are enshrouding the planet in heat trapping gases and a research review published last November found significant flaws in the methodologies assumptions or analyses used by the 3 percent of scientists who concluded otherwise. Calls for the red team blue team exercise began in April one month before the date marked on the top of the documents.On April 20 the day before the March for Science protest in Washington D.C. New York University physicist Steve Koonin published an op ed in The Wall Street Journal calling for a red team blue team exercise to put the consensus to the test and improve public understanding through an open adversarial process. The next day Judith Curry a retired climatologist known for mocking other scientists as alarmists and Anthony Watts who runs a popular climate change denial blog endorsed the idea.The next week Pruitt met with Koonin for an hour according to schedules published by The Washington Post. The meeting included about 40 climate scientists economists lawyers and other experts to discuss the possible creation by the Trump administration of a Red Team Blue Team exercise on climate change he wrote. He noted this was the second Red Team briefing following an initial gathering on June 14 in Washington D.C. A final summit is scheduled for Nov. 8 the day before the Heartland Institutes America First Energy Conference in Houston. This seems to be the goal of the list which includes 145 scientists and 60 economists who have long been on the fringes of the climate debate making their names as contrarians given to bombastic public statements. In his email Bast said he assembled a list of around 150 climate experts which he sent to folks at EPA in response to their request for recommendations. A source who requested anonymity provided the list to the watchdog Climate Investigations Center which shared it with HuffPost. Aztec priests told people they must cut out their beating hearts to bring better climate for their crops. The people believed them he wrote in a December 2015 blog post. Todays climate priests tell people they must cut out their CO2 emissions and pay penances to other nations like China to save our climate. The people believe them. I would go right down to the core starting with the question How much do human emissions increase atmospheric carbon dioxide? Thats the first assumption the blue team makes and they have to prove that thats true he said. In my opinion the red team would win that debate on the carbon dioxide. Carlin spent decades as an economist working at the EPA before becoming a conservative media darling for publicly accusing the agency of muzzling his criticism of the endangerment finding. He was never assigned to work on climate change and holds a doctorate in economics not atmospheric science or climatology and his comments on the finding were deemed to be the product of rushed and at times shoddy scholarship according to a 2009 analysis by The New York Times. Yet he submitted the 93 page report suggesting the research behind human caused climate change is more religion than science.	True	True	True	True	False
It is a landmark deal that has been more than two decades in the making. Russia Iran Azerbaijan Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan all bordering the Caspian Sea have agreed in principle on how to divide it up. Their leaders signed the Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea in the Kazakh city of Aktau on Sunday. It establishes a formula for dividing up its resources and prevents other powers from setting up a military presence there. It is an important step in the easing of regional tensions but the deal over the world's largest inland body of water matters for several reasons. Here's what you need to know about the hotly disputed Caspian Sea. It would be reasonable to assume that the Caspian Sea is well a sea. But at the heart of this long running dispute is whether or not the 370000 sq km 143000 sq mile body of landlocked water should be considered a lake. Until the dissolution of the Soviet Union USSR in 1991 that's what it was known as and shared between the USSR and Iran. But the arrival on the scene of new countries complicated this issue with ensuing claim and counterclaim. Iran had argued it was a lake and not a sea but none of the four other countries agreed. Why is the difference so important? If it was treated as a sea then it would be covered by international maritime law namely the United Nations Law of the Sea. This binding document sets rules on how countries can use the world's oceans. It covers areas such as the management of natural resources territorial rights and the environment. And it is not limited to littoral states meaning others can seek access to its resources. But if it is defined as a lake then it would have to be divided equally between all five countries. Sunday's agreement goes some way to settling this dispute. The signed convention gives the body of water a special legal status which means it is not defined as a sea or a lake Russian officials said. The surface water will be in common usage meaning freedom of access for all littoral states beyond territorial waters. But the seabed which is rich in natural resources will be divided up. It's difficult to say as the final text of the deal is yet to be published. Another key factor is that seabed boundaries are yet to be negotiated although now it's the subject of bilateral agreements not multilateral as before. But because the deal does not define the Caspian as a lake Iran which has the smallest coastline is viewed as a potential loser. Iranian social media users have accused the government in Tehran of selling off the Caspian Sea on Sunday. However Iran which is currently under growing political and economic pressure from the West might see some political benefits in securing the clause that bars any armed presence on the Caspian other than that of the five littoral states. Had the Caspian been defined as a lake Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan who have established an early claim over large areas of the Caspian stood to lose out under such a split. So the basis of all previous disagreements stems from who gets access to what. This is important because... The Caspian Sea is highly prized for its vast oil and gas reserves. It's estimated there are 50 billion barrels of oil and nearly 300 trillion cubic feet 8.4 trillion cubic metres of natural gas beneath its seabed. That is why disagreements over how to divide some of its huge oil and gas fields have been numerous and acrimonious. On occasion warships have been deployed to scare off contractors hired by rival countries. The disagreement over its legal status has also prevented a natural gas pipeline being built across the Caspian between Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan. This would have allowed Turkmen gas to bypass Russia on its way to Europe. Russia a major exporter of gas and oil to Europe has previously objected to this. International oil companies that rushed to the Caspian in the 1990s have now pulled out. But there is a possibility this could be explored further following Sunday's deal. The Caspian Sea has a number of different species of sturgeon the fish that yields the highly prized delicacy caviar. Between 80 90 of the world's caviar is sourced from the Caspian but the numbers have been falling over the past few decades. In 2002 a survey found that the fish was rapidly disappearing and could soon become extinct. It also found an abnormally large proportion of young sturgeon in comparison to more mature fish which produce the eggs used to make caviar. In response various bans on sturgeon fishing in the Caspian Sea and on the caviar trade more generally have been introduced. Significantly Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev said on Sunday that the recent agreement allowed the setting of national quotas for fishing. The Caspian Sea has long suffered pollution from oil extraction and other industries. Oil pollution has affected the migration routes of sturgeon according to the UN's Caucasus Environment Outlook. It says sturgeon swim through highly polluted water near Azerbaijan's Absheron Peninsula and that is believed to limit their food and oxygen. A more recent concern is bacterial pollution caused by sewage from Iran which is adding to the threats facing sturgeon fish. The Caspian Sea's disputed legal status was also a risk factor for the environment as no enforcement would have been possible to deal with a major oil spill or other pollution incident in disputed waters.

UN climate talks ended Sunday without a full agreement of world powers on how to address the imminent threat of global warming. AP News Frank Jordans and Aritz Parra While the negotiations were meant to shore up the Paris agreement and define the terms on which the signatory countries would reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. But Trump has pulled the US out of the deal unofficially since the US cant formally withdraw until November 4 2020 the day after the American presidential election. Vox Umair Irfan The US along with other major polluters blocked a nonbinding measure that set higher standards for emissions reduction across the world and left little more than a weak call to action in the final declaration of the event. New York Times Somini Sengupta Several other countries who are experiencing climate disasters of their own such as Australia and Brazil also participated in gutting the summit. Financial Times Were in a very politically difficult time right now where weve got one key world leader denying climate change so its very hard to get other countries to move forward when youve got such a critical country playing a spoiling role said Ian Fry a delegate from Tuvalu.

The survey commissioned by the progressive think tank Data for Progress and conducted online from Oct. 11 15 found even stronger support among young voters and people of color. Voters aged 18 29 ranked green jobs as their No. 4 priority and voters of color in that age range ranked it No. 3. In a Gallup poll last month just 1 percent of Americans including Republicans and independents as well as Democrats chose environmentpollution as the countrys most important problem from a list of dozens of issues. In a separate May 2017 Gallup survey just 2 percent of Americans listed create more green jobs as the best policy to increase employment in the United States compared to 19 percent who listed keep manufacturing jobs hereStop sending overseas. The findings come as the Trump administration is on the cusp of fully rolling back two of the most critical federal rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Next year the White House is planning a make a new push to build more oil and gas pipelines Larry Kudlow the presidents top economic adviser said at an event this month. Already at least six of the Democratic senators expected to run for president in 2020 are backing legislation to guarantee a job to every American worker who wants one. Its an idea roughly 46 percent of Americans support according to an April survey by Rasmussen Reports. Polling Data for Progress released in September pegged the number slightly higher at 55 percent of eligible U.S. voters but found that those opposed decreased from 23 percent to 18 percent when the guaranteed jobs are green. Even among Trump voters the September survey found support for guaranteed jobs is stronger when the jobs are green with 35 percent in support and 36 percent opposed. Without an environmental focus Trump voters in support of guaranteed jobs dropped to 30 percent with 45 percent opposed. Even in deep red counties in fossil fuel producing states support for requiring utilities to produce 20 percent of electricity from renewables averages well above 50 percent according to 2018 survey data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. Support for providing tax rebates for energy efficient vehicles and solar panels soars well above 75 percent in most of those same counties. Adopting a green jobs plan could also help Democrats ease the tension between the partys labor and climate hawks. In August the Democratic National Committee backtracked on a two month old ban on fossil fuel donations. The move was a cave to unions that overwhelmingly support pipeline projects that pay much better than renewable energy jobs which tend not to use organized labor. Still the policy seems far off at best. Its difficult to imagine such a bill passing a Republican dominated Congress much less gaining Trumps signature. Democratic leadership has indicated it has no plans to push a major climate bill even if the party takes the House of Representatives in next months election. Yet theres a small contingent of left wing candidates including Wisconsin congressional candidate Randy Bryce and Kevin de Len the California lawmaker challenging Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein who are running on a so called Green New Deal a reference to the Great Depression era spending programs that established many of the nations infrastructure landmarks. Ocasio Cortez the democratic socialist expected to become the next U.S. representative for New Yorks 14th Congressional District likened climate change to the existential threat posed by Nazi Germany and the Axis. The last time we had a really major existential threat to this country was around World War II Ocasio Cortez said at a campaign event. And so weve been here before and we have a blueprint of doing this before. Climate scientists tend to agree. In July Penn State University climatologist Michael Mann called Ocasio Cortezs proposal for trillions in federal spending on a Green New Deal to be just the sort of audacious and bold thinking we will need if we are going to avert a climate crisis. Just three weeks ago a sobering United Nations report warned that world governments have just 12 years to halve emissions in order to avert cataclysmic climate change. And even then the researchers found that technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere will be required to keep warming within 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit beyond which scientists say many densely populated places will become uninhabitable. Progress to mitigate climate change has been alarmingly limited. Despite the rapid construction of renewable energy infrastructure the United States the worlds largest per capita emitter is aggressively bolstering its fossil fuel production. Last year Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement which every recognized country on Earth has signed. Brazil the vast rainforests of which are critical to absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is poised to elect a president who vowed to ramp up deforestation and withdraw from the historic 2015 accord as well. China the worlds top national emitter is continuing to build new coal plants despite pledging to cancel the facilities.	True	False	False	True	False
Warmer temperatures are threatening American songbirds with dwindling numbers due to an inability to successfully breed a new study from Scientific Reports alleges. A team of researchers studied migratory patterns of songbirds between 2001 and 2012 and claimed that of the 48 North American songbird species that migrate north nine of these or almost 20 percent didnt reach the grounds by the deadline critical for mating and breeding the next generation of birds wrote Karla Lant in her summary of the report Plants in eastern North America are greening up sooner than normal because of global warming the report contends while plants in the western part of the continent are somehow undergoing the process later. This means that birds such as the Townsends warbler and the rose breasted grosbeak are arriving either too soon and being met with frigid temperatures or too late and missing out on the insect boom that coincides with the new plant growth Lant stated. Either way the birds have a much lower chance of surviving and reproducing the report alleges so the nine species identified are consequently in danger of dwindling numbers. As climate at the breeding grounds changes birds may be unable to adjust wintering ground departure times and transit speeds sufficiently to match their arrival with altered breeding resource phenology particularly leaf growth and the closely associated emergence of herbivorous insects the report warns. If attributing changes in migratory patterns of songbirds to global warming after a mere 12 years of observation strikes readers as highly suspicious thats probably because it is. Event attributionthe ability to link a given phenomenon to manmade global warmingis exceedingly speculative at best and completely unreliable at worst even according to true believers. At a meeting of climate scientists at Oxford in 2012 one participant argued that given the insufficient observational data and the coarse and mathematically imperfect climate models used to generate attribution claims they are unjustifiably speculative basically unverifiable and better not made at all. Nature Magazine felt compelled to conclude with unusual modesty that better models are needed before exceptional events can be reliably linked to global warming. Of course the purpose of studies such as these which remarkably continue to receive funding is ultimately practical rather than speculative. They are meant primarily not to inform but to exhort and to put pressure on policy makers to coerce human behavior change in accordance with climate change theory. As for the fate of these migratory birds that really depends on how far were willing to go to end manmade climate change Lants article predictably concludes. Climate change is projected to drive hundreds of bird species to extinction and greatly reduce the ranges of others the report prophecies and is already impacting species richness and composition.

Washington CNN Hurricane Florence ravaged Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina in September leaving behind an estimated 3.6 billion worth of wreckage. But there's no mention of that in a new Pentagon report detailing the impact of climate change on the defense department. The Report on Effects of a Changing Climate to the Department of Defense does not mention Camp Lejeune the Marine Corps Hurricane Florence or even the threats posed by extreme weather events more destructive storms more intense rainfall that scientists say are more likely given climate change and global warming. Those omissions are just one reason lawmakers greeted the Congressionally mandated report with eviscerating criticism on Friday. The report didn't meet the legal requirement to list the 10 most vulnerable military installations for each service they said. And despite the global impact of climate change it didn't list a single US military installation outside the United States. Lawmakers pointing to President Donald Trump's skepticism about climate change and his administration's steady rollback of measures meant to mitigate the impacts of global warming were scathing. The report is an inadequate incomplete partisan document said Sen. Jack Reed the ranking Democratic member of the Armed Services Committee. We know that climate change is real and impacts the way our Armed Forces carry out their missions in different parts of the globe Reed said in a statement. Former Secretary James Mattis recognized and affirmed this fact. The Pentagon report follows a January study by the Government Accountability Office that found that under the Trump administration the State Department removed guidance to overseas missions on how to include climate change risks in their country strategies particularly in relation to migration. The Pentagon report notes that the department is incorporating climate resilience as a cross cutting consideration for our planning and decision making process and not as a separate program or specific set of actions. Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Mike Andrews said the effects of a changing climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to DOD missions operational plans and installations. But Reed noted that despite legal requirements the Pentagon report simply outlined an alphabetical list of 79 military installations. The report reads like an introductory primer and carries about as much value as a phonebook he said. And Rep. Jim Langevin a Rhode Island Democrat who sits on the House Armed Services Committee said he was deeply disappointed. Langevin noted that the the report comes after a year where the Department suffered nearly 10 billion in damage in just two extreme events at Tyndall Air Force Base and Camp Lejeunetwo installations that were not even evaluated. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said the report highlights the climate vulnerabilities of the top 79 mission assurance priority installations. By using this alternative approach we are able to highlight where there are operational risks. The Pentagon did not answer multiple questions from CNN including why it failed to meet Congress' request to list the 10 most vulnerable installations why it mentioned no military installations outside the US or why the climate factors it considered did not include extreme weather and why Camp Lejeune isn't listed among the 79 installations. Babb also declined to respond to Reed's criticism. The report acknowledges that the effects of a changing climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to Department of Defense missions operational plans and installations. It looks at the impact of recurrent flooding noting that Joint Base Langley in Virginia has seen a 14 inch sea level rise since 1930. It briefly notes military installations affected drought particularly in the southwest and by desertification. The report touches on wildfires that came close to Space Launch complexes and a southern California base as well as thawing permafrost in Alaska. Although no overseas military installations were listed the report noted the widely recognized impact climate change has on fragile regions particularly in Africa and Asia and the instability and conflict it can create. It lists a few projects the defense department has undertaken with partner countries and notes the need to consider how drought and desertification impact overseas bases and missions. The report also raised very briefly the logistical challenge weather conditions can create for intelligence collection surveillance and reconnaissance as well as recovery and casualty evacuation. And it flagged the way climate change will create new security challenges in the Arctic where melting ice means greater access but also greater international competition for the waterways.

WASHINGTON Gasoline oil and other contaminants that threaten groundwater are seeping from more than 70000 underground tanks around the country but the federal aid that has helped address the problem could soon start drying up. The Trump administration is proposing to slash funding for the Leaking Underground Storage Tank program by nearly half next year from nearly 92 million this year to about 47 million in 2018. The recommended cut in the LUST program is part of the presidents proposal to reduce the Environmental Protection Agency budget by 31 next year. Funding for LUST is a drop inthe EPAs 8.2 billion budget. But state officials environmental activists and public health advocates warn that the size of the cut carries great risk considering groundwater is the source of drinking water for nearly half of all Americans. They say such a reduction would hamper monitoring prevention enforcement and cleanup of leaks as well as the important role EPA plays in providing technical assistance to state regulators and businesses many of them gas stations who have aging tanks and piping under their sites. In a letter earlier this year to congressional leaders the head of the trade organization representing state solid waste agencies said the cut would impedethe long term progress states have made on inspection and cleanup. The program has made great strides in increasing the number of compliant tanks in the last 25 years which has resulted in fewer releases wrote Dania Rodriguez executive director of the Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials. Loss of program funding would reverse this trend. The Trump administration announced the proposed cut in May two months after the Department of Veterans Affairs officially recognized the harm contaminated water some of it linked to underground fuel tanks inflicted on hundreds of thousands of marines stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina from 1953 through 1987. Under the VA program announced in March those who served at least 30 days in Lejeune during that period are eligible for treatment of eight diseases including several cancers and Parkinsons Disease. There are 558451 active tanks located in about 201000 sites nationwide according to the EPA's most recent tally. Most are service stations but they also include any operation where fuel is stored underground such as government fleet garages large retail operations like Costco stores that sell gas and institutions like hospitals or universities that store fuel to power emergency generators. Across the country thousands of underground storage tanks and accompanying pipes many of them made from older corroding steel hold and carry a variety of fuels and chemicals the Environmental Defense Fund wrote in a recent report. When tanks leak harmful chemicals such as oil gas benzene and toluene into soil and ground water drinking water and soil are fouled community health is jeopardized and economic development is crippled. The number of tanks with confirmed releases hit a high in 1995 with nearly 172000. But the backlog of sites needing to be cleaned up has been declining since 2000 according to EPA records. As of March 31 EPA reported 70094tanks with confirmed leaks. Some of these are not actively leaking but have residual contamination that needs to be cleaned up. Superfund cuts would lead to delays in toxic cleanups experts warn Florida leads the list of states reporting the most leaking tanks with 10421 followed by Michigan 8000 Illinois 5733 New Jersey 5100and North Carolina 4006. Site owners are ultimately liable for cleanup costs but a taxpayer funded trust fund is in place when sites must be addressed quickly are abandoned or when owners dont have the resources. The fund is financed by a 0.1 cent per gallon tax on gasolinewhich generated 202 million in 2016. Administration officials did not offer much explanation for the cut one of dozens proposed in the EPA budget. Historically the underground tank program has worked closely with our state territorial and tribal partners an agency spokeswoman wrote in an email. We know they are on the front lines to protect our land and groundwater from petroleum leaks such as those from gas stations and other underground storage tank facilities and we expect this partnership will continue to be a hallmark of the program. She wrote it would be premature for us to speculate about EPAs budget given that Congress has yet to finalize the agencys funding for next year. The House Appropriations Committee voted in July to restore almost all of the funding for the program but neither the full House nor the Senate has acted yet. The cost of cleaning up a site depends on a variety of factors including the extent of contamination and state cleanup standards. The average cleanup is estimated to cost 130000 but can rise to over 1 million if groundwater is infected. Ben Thomas a former tank inspector and state regulator in Alaska who now consults with private operators on meeting the inspection rules said cutting the program would hurt businesses that have come to appreciate the heavy stick of enforcement for bad players and the general community outreach. Slashing a program known for the collaboration between regulators and businesses and the effectiveness its achieved in reducing the backlog of leaking tanks would be crippling he said. At some point such a deep cut makes any agency effectively non responsive Thomas said. Theres simply not enough money to know what to prioritize. Stuff that makes a big stink like enforcement would probably get cut as would the ability for states to maintain a hotline maintaina web page or do workshops.I could easily imagine all that stuff would be kind of viewed as frivolous and go away because its not core statement message stuff.

WASHINGTON The Trump administration is moving to roll back the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's efforts to slow global warming seeking to ease restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from coal fired power plants. In a plan expected to be made public in coming days the Environmental Protection Agency EPA declared the Obama era rule exceeded federal law by setting emissions standards that power plants could not reasonably meet. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the 43 page document which underscored President Trump's bid to revive the struggling coal industry. The EPA's new proposal would make good on Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to unravel Obama's efforts to curb global warming and follows Mr. Trump's promise to pull the United States out of the landmark Paris climate agreement. Nearly 200 countries have committed to combat global warming by reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. The EPA won't prescribe an immediate replacement to the plan but will seek public comment on whether to curb climate warming emissions from coal and natural gas power plants. A spokeswoman for EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt declined to comment Friday on the authenticity of the leaked document but said the Obama administration pushed the bounds of their authority so far that the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay to prevent the Clean Power Plan from taking effect. Any replacement rule that the Trump administration proposes will be done carefully and properly within the confines of the law EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said. The plan was first reported by Bloomberg News. The Obama administration's cost benefits analysis of the Clean Power Plan was highly uncertain in multiple areas Bowman said vowing that the Trump administration will present a range of scenarios to the public in a robust open and transparent way. Obama's plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions. The Supreme Court put the plan on hold last year following a legal challenge by industry and coal friendly states. Even so the plan has been a factor in a wave of retirements of coal fired plants which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power and state mandates promoting energy conservation. Repealing the Clean Power Plan without a timeline or a commitment to propose a rule to reduce carbon pollution isn't a step forward it's a wholesale retreat from EPA's legal scientific and moral obligation to address the threats of climate change' said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. While the Supreme Court has concluded that EPA is obligated to regulate greenhouse gases this administration has no intention of following the law said McCarthy who led the EPA when the Clean Power Plan was completed. They are denying it just as they are denying the science. They're using stall tactics to defer action ignoring the courts and the demands of the American people. Industry groups cheered the planned repeal saying it would reverse regulatory overreach by Obama and McCarthy. The Clean Power Plan represented an unlawful attempt to transform the nation's power grid ... and raise costs on American consumers said Hal Quinn president and CEO of the National Mining Association. The Obama era plan would have sharply reduced the number of coal fired plants making the grid more vulnerable to reliability concerns and increasing costs with trivial environmental benefits Quinn said. The new plan will save an estimated 240 million tons of annual coal production and safeguard more than 27000 mining jobs and almost 100000 additional jobs throughout the supply chain he said. In the leaked document the Trump administration argues that repealing the Clean Power Plan could spare an estimated 33 billion in compliance costs in 2030 arguing that the Obama administration overstated the rule's potential health benefits. Previously the EPA had estimated that by 2030 the Clean Power Plan would prevent 90000 asthma attacks and up to 3600 premature deaths a year. The leaked document casts doubts on those numbers and says the EPA plans to perform updated modeling and analysis of health benefits and other impacts of the rule. Liz Perera climate policy director for the Sierra Club said repealing the Clean Power Plan is about one thing and one thing only helping corporate polluters profit.	True	False	False	True	False
Trump's EPA Plans To Ease Carbon Emissions Rule For New Coal Plants The Trump administration plans to eliminate an Obama era requirement that new coal fired power plants have expensive technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions. This latest administration effort to boost fossil fuel industries comes as leaders from nearly 200 countries are meeting in Poland to discuss how to keep greenhouse gasses out of the atmosphere. And amid reports that CO2 emissions are rising again as well as the administration's own report that climate change is causing more severe weather more frequently and could eventually hurt the U.S. economy. The Environmental Protection Agency proposal would revise its New Source Performance Standards for coal power plants allowing coal fired generators to emit more CO2 per megawatt hour of electricity generated. This would ease an Obama era rule that was a central target in critics' accusations of a war on coal. The coal industry argues the existing Obama administration requirements made it all but impossible to build new coal power plants by requiring costly technologies such as carbon capture and storage. EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler a former coal industry lobbyist echoed that argument in announcing the proposed rule change. By replacing onerous regulations with high yet achievable standards we can continue America's historic energy production keep energy prices affordable and encourage new investments in cutting edge technology that can then be exported around the world said Wheeler. Environmental groups argue that in order to reduce climate change risks the world will have to stop burning coal. They blasted the EPA's announcement. This is just one more foolhardy move by a misguided administration that will be judged harshly by future generations said David Doniger senior strategic director of the Climate Clean Energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Today's proposal is nothing more than another thoughtless attempt by the Trump Administration to prop up their backwards and false narrative about reviving coal at the expense of science public safety and reality said Mary Anne Hitt senior director of Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign. In fact it's not at all clear if the change would help the ailing coal industry. In recent years it has stopped building new plants and been shutting down old ones instead. The federal Energy Information Administration reports U.S. coal consumption has declined over the last decade and this year is expected to be at its lowest level in 39 years. Even as coal use rises in China and India coal has struggled in the U.S. to compete with cheaper electricity produced from natural gas and renewable energy. But coal industry officials believe this rule change will still help. It does appear that this proposal would make it feasible for new coal plants to be a viable option in the future in the United States says Michelle Bloodworth president and CEO of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. This is the latest in a series of efforts the Trump administration has taken to help the coal business. Previous actions include relaxing Obama era regulations on carbon emissions and mercury emissions as well as rolling back existing regulations that govern coal ash. The EPA will collect public comments on the proposal for 60 days and plans to hold a public hearing on the proposed rule change.	True	True	False	True	True
In fact its getting bigger scientists now admit. A University of Auckland study examined changes in the geography of Tuvalus nine atolls and 101 reef islands between 1971 and 2014 using aerial photographs and satellite imagery. It found eight of the atolls and almost three quarters of the islands grew during the study period lifting Tuvalus total land area by 2.9 percent even though sea levels in the country rose at twice the global average. Co author Paul Kench said the research published Friday in the journal Nature Communications challenged the assumption that low lying island nations would be swamped as the sea rose. We tend to think of Pacific atolls as static landforms that will simply be inundated as sea levels rise but there is growing evidence these islands are geologically dynamic and are constantly changing he said. The study findings may seem counter intuitive given that the sea level has been rising in the region over the past half century but the dominant mode of change over that time on Tuvalu has been expansion not erosion. If only theyd done their study a bit earlier they could have saved a lot of alarmists a lot of worry. Asrecently as last year anxious wonks produced a paper for the World Bank arguing that the situation in Tuvalu pop. 11000 and nearby Kiribati pop.107000 was so dire that Australia and New Zealand should open their doors to the fleeing refugees. According to the paper In 2007 Grist went so far as to cite Tuvalu of one of climate changes most tragic victims. Climate Change in Tuvalu even has its own Wikipedia page. It records possibly Tuvalus greatest moment of glory on the international stage when it seized the opportunity at the 2009 Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen to grandstand about its terrible plight. In December 2009 the islands stalled talks atUnited Nations Climate Change ConferenceinCopenhagen fearing some other developing countries were not committing fully to binding deals on a reduction in carbon emission their chief negotiator stated Tuvalu is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change and our future rests on the outcome of this meeting.57When the conference failed to reach a binding meaningful agreement Tuvalus representative Ian Fry said It looks like we are being offered30 pieces of silverto betray our people and our future Our future is not for sale. I regret to inform you that Tuvalu cannot accept this document.58 Frys speech to the conference was a highly impassioned plea for countries around the world to address the issues of man made global warming resulting in climate change. The five minute speech addressed the dangers of rising sea levels to Tuvalu and the world. In his speech Fry claimed man made global warming to be currently the greatest threat to humanity and ended with an emotional the fate of my country rests in your hands.59 Tuvalus plightalso formed part of the basis for arguably the most hysterical fake news claim in the history of climate alarmism the UNs prediction that by the end of 2010 climate change would have created 50 million environmental refugees. The UN has since removed the claim from most of its websites. Happily it can still be glimpsed in the Guardian archives Rising sea levels desertification and shrinking freshwater supplies will create up to 50 million environmental refugees by the end of the decade experts warn today. Janos Bogardi director of the Institute for Environment and Human Security at the United Nations University in Bonn said creeping environmental deterioration already displaced up to 10 million people a year and the situation would get worse. There are well founded fears that the number of people fleeing untenable environmental conditions may grow exponentially as the world experiences the effects of climate change Dr Bogardi said. This new category of refugee needs to find a place in international agreements. We need to better anticipate support requirements similar to those of people fleeing other unviable situations. In reality the total number of environmental refugees fleeing climate change so far around the world is close to zero. But that hasnt stopped a few chancers from trying it on Seventeen people from the Pacific including 11 from Tuvalu and five from Kiribati have already made refugee claims in New Zealand citing climate change as part of their basis of claim. None have been successful four have yet to be determined and 13 have been rejected because the refugees convention does not recognise climate change as grounds for protection. Toclimate skeptics the fact that Tuvalu is not drowning will come as no surprise whatsoever. Their favorite sea levels expert Nils Axel Mrner has written numerous papers on the subject.

James Ooker Eskridge is the mayor of a town on an island disappearing in the Chesapeake Bay but rather than see it as evidence of global warming he used it to shut down Al Gores narrative that the seas are rising because of climate change. Eskridge faced the climate warming alarmist during a CNN town hall on global warming. Im a commercial crabber Eskridge said and Ive been working the Chesapeake Bay for 50 plus years. And I have a crab house business out on the water. And water level is the same as it was when the place was built in 1970. Im not a scientist but Im a keen observer and if sea level rises are occurring he asked why am I not seeing signs of it? Our island is disappearing he explained but its because of erosion and not because of sea level rising unless we get a seawall we will lose our island. But back to the question he said why am I not seeing signs of the sea level rising? What do you think the erosion is due to mayor? Gore asked. So youre losing the island even though the waves havent increased Gore said. Yes Eskridge replied his erosion has been going on since Captain John Smith discovered the island. Well arguments about science arent necessarily going to be any comfort to you and Im sorry for what youre going through Gore said. It wont necessarily do you any good for me to tell you that the scientists do say that the sea level is rising in the Chesapeake Bay he continued and that youve lost about two thirds of your island already over a longer period of time. And the forecast for the future is another two feet of sea if there was another two feet of sea level rise what would that mean for Tangier Island? Tangier Island our elevation is only about 4feet above level Eskridge said and if I see sea level rise occurring Ill shout it from the housetops we dont have you know the land to give up. But Im just not seeing it he said. Eskridges plight to save his island reached mainstream media attention when President Donald Trump called him after seeing a CNN report about the disappearing islands Trump supporting mayor. Trump reportedly told him to not worry about his island and that it would be there for many hundreds of years more. It wasnt clear if he addressed the seawall construction to save the island. Gore is currently making the rounds to publicize the sequel to his global climate documentary An Inconvenient Truth. Recentlyhe said that the global warming fight was in the same vein as great moral causes of humanity in the past like the Civil Rights cause of the 60s and abolition.	True	False	False	True	False
The study by a team of geographers and archaeologists from UCL and King's College London published in Nature Communications suggests that early pastoralists in North Africa combined detailed knowledge of the environment with newly domesticated species to deal with the long term drying trend. It is thought that early pastoralists in North Africa developed intricate ways to efficiently manage sparse vegetation and relatively dry and low fertility soils. Dr. Chris Brierley UCL Geography lead author said The possibility that humans could have had a stabilising influence on the environment has significant implications. We contest the common narrative that past human environment interactions must always be one of over exploitation and degradation. The fact that societies practising 'pastoralism' persisted in this region for so long and invested both economically and ideologically in the local landscape does not support the scenario of over exploitation. Our study shows that increasing human population and sustainable pastoralism did not accelerateand may even have delayedthe decline of the 'Green Sahara'. Around 8000 years ago the Sahara wasn't desert but instead was a vibrant ecosystem that supported hunter gatherers and fisherfolk. The 'Green Sahara' the colloquial term for the African Humid Period was the period in which North Africa became much wetter than it is today thanks to a series of monsoons. As the Earth's orbit slowly changed the rain started to reduce and the vegetation started to die back. Around 5500 years ago the ecosystem in the Sahara went into a terminal decline towards the desert we have today. Pastoralism nomadic or semi nomadic cattle herders blossomed in the Sahara from around 1000 years before that collapse. Previous studies have put the blame for the collapse of the 'Green Sahara' onto these nomads who have often been marginalised in history but this latest studies dispels that myth. The study uses a novel climate vegetation model to determine whether the end of the African Humid Period occurred earlier than expected. The model keeps track of variables such as vegetation and rainfall and other processes such as the amount of energy coming from the sun and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The model found that the 'Green Sahara' should have collapsed earlier than it did. This suggests that pastoralists lasted longer than expected and the techniques they used helped them to adapt to the environmental changes. Dr. Brierley added Those places where pastoralists last longer are where there are more resources. It's a good adaptation to the climate change taking place at the time. There is now work today looking at what we can learn from nomadic pastoralists such as selective grazing strategies which can be applied to sustainable adaption to desertification that we expect from future climate change. Dr. Katie Manning King's College London concluded Despite the largely inhospitable conditions of the Sahara today it is not hard to find evidence of human occupation from the last 11000 years. Thousands of rock art sites illustrate a lush environment large game hunting and livestock herding. The spread of domestic animals across the Sahara occurred at a time of increasing climatic instability and yet these pastoralist populations thrived. It is likely that strategies used by contemporary traditional herders such as seasonal movement and selective grazing were also used by these early pastoralists helping to maintain an otherwise deteriorating ecosystem.

The Wall Street Journals Kimberley Strassel issued a blistering critique of the proposed Green New Deal saying that the proposal reads like a parody of the Democratic Party done by Republicans. By the end of the Green New Deal resolution and accompanying fact sheet I was laughing so hard I nearly cried Strassel wrote on Twitter. If a bunch of GOPers plotted to forge a fake Democratic bill showing how bonkers the party is they could not have done a better job. It is beautiful. The Green New Deal pushed by freshman New York Democrat Alexandra Ocasio Cortez attempts to radically transform the country including rendering air travel obsolete move the U.S. to rely completely on renewable energy with net zero emissions and guarantee economic security even for people who are unwilling to work. OCASIO CORTEZ CONTRADICTS HERSELF ON ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN MASSIVE AND UNPRECEDENTED 'GREEN NEW DEAL' But the sweeping proposal was hit with mockery once the details were unveiled on Thursday with many pointing out how unrealistic the suggestions are. Strassel pointed out that in order to live up to the proposals promise of 100 percent of renewable energy a space as big as the entire state of California would have to be dedicated solely for the facilities wind turbines and solar panels. The proposals suggestion of putting charging stations everywhere upgrading or replacing every building and developinghigh speed railway across every state may also hit a wall due to permitting laws. FULL TEXT GREEN NEW DEAL FAQ CALLS FOR ABOLISHING 'FARTING COWS' AND 'AIRPLANES' ASAP Strassel notes that the Green New Deal is far from just a proposal to curb emissions and create more environmental regulations its also about implementing radical left wing measures. Somehow government run healthcare family sustainable wages paid leave and affordable housing are also required for a clean economy the writer wrote. I would love to understand this logic. And imagine what wages will need to be to pay for billion dollar per kilowatt electricity. But even those pushing for the document arent sure it can actually be achieved within 10 years. In a now deleted FAQ page on Ocasio Cortezs website the document explains that its calling for an elimination of greenhouse gas emissions rather than an immediate ban on fossil fuels because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast. Planes run on fossil fuel. No fossil fuel no visits to granny. Cows produce methane why alarmists want to get rid of livestock Stressel wrote. She can't do it fully in 10 years but AOC is coming after your air miles and bacon. This is honesty sp about how Democrats would micromanage private life. Lastly the Green New Deal which doesnt exactly reveal how it will be funded except for the suggestion that the Federal Reserve could step in and extend credit. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And how to pay for mass trillions in cost? Don't worry! Federal Reserve will just extend credit and new public banks can be created to extend credit too the writer tweeted. Because you know like money is just paper and how hard can it be to make some more of the stuff right? Right?	False	False	False	True	True
A coalition of states filed a legal challenge Wednesday against the Trump administrations decision to roll back a slew of Obama era climate regulations. The legal motion comes after Trump signed an executive order targeting climate change regulations ushered in by former President Barack Obama.The New York led group of states argue Trumps Environmental Protections Agency has a legal obligation to regulate emissions some climate scientists believe contribute to global warming. The law is clear the EPA must limit carbon pollution from power plants New York Attorney General EricSchneiderman who is leading the legal challengesaid in a statement.Other statesbehind the challenge include California Delaware Maryland and Massachusetts. The motion asks the District of Columbia U.S. Court of Appeals to toss out a request fromthe Trump administration for a delay in the court proceedings on an Obama era policy known as the Clean Power Plan. Trumps executive order was largely aimed at halting the Clean Power Plan whichrequired states to slash carbon dioxide emissions from coal power plants. The plan was never implemented however because it was challenged in court by 26 Republican led states. The Trump administrationsays this and other Obama era rules hinder the American economy and create a stultifying business environment. The coalition of states argued in a statement the delay would waste the substantial resources already expended in this litigation according to a statement from the group. Schneiderman hired Howard Master a prosecutor who served under an Obama appointed U.S. attorney to focus on corruption cases involving the Trump administration.Masters primary responsibility according to Schneidermans office will be investigating and possibly prosecuting the Trump administration for possible civil rights abuses. Schneidermans decision to hire Master may indicate the crusading AG plans to flood Trump and his administration with legal filings subpoenas and lawsuitsThe Wall Street Journal reported. Master will be working on a wide range of civil and criminal investigations and enforcement matters including public corruption complex civil litigation Eric Soufer a spokesman for Schneiderman told WSJ. Schneidermanhas made fighting what he calls man made global warming a crucial part of his duties as New Yorkstop law office. Hehas engaged in a months long investigation into whether Exxon Mobilillegally hid internal climate research from the public and shareholders. The Democrat based the bulk of his probes on research from left leading media outlets many of which receive funding from wealthy environmental groups.

Newly released emails show senior Environmental Protection Agency officials working closely with a conservative group that dismisses climate change to rally like minded people for public hearings on science and global warming counter negative news coverage and tout Scott Pruitts stewardship of the agency. John Konkus EPAs deputy associate administrator for public affairs repeatedly reached out to senior staffers at the Heartland Institute according to the emails. If you send a list we will make sure an invitation is sent Konkus wrote to the then Heartland president Joseph Bast in May 2017 seeking suggestions on scientists and economists the EPA could invite to an annual EPA public hearing on the agencys science standards. Follow up emails show Konkus and the Heartland Institute mustering scores of potential invitees known for rejecting scientific warnings of human caused climate change including from groups such as Plants Need CO2 The Right Climate Stuff and Junk Science. The emails underscore how Pruitt and senior agency officials have sought to surround themselves with people who share their vision of curbing environmental regulation and enforcement leading to complaints from environmentalists that he is ignoring the conclusions of the majority of scientists in and out of his agency especially when it comes to climate changing carbon emissions. They were obtained by the Environmental Defence Fund and the Southern Environmental Law Centre which sued to enforce a Freedom of Information request. The EPA maintains close working relationships with a broad range of public and private groups and Heartland is just one of many the agency engages with to ensure the public is informed said the EPA spokesman Lincoln Ferguson. It demonstrates the agencys dedication to advancing President Trumps agenda of environmental stewardship and regulatory certainty he said. The public hearing referred to in the May 2017 email was cancelled when the EPA official who runs it fell ill the EPA said. But Bast contended in an email sent to EPA staffers and others that the official called off the hearing after learning that climate change sceptics planned to attend. The Heartland Institute calls itself a leading free market thinktank. It rejects decades of science saying fossil fuel emissions are altering the climate and says on its website that curbing use of petroleum and coal to fight climate change would squander one of Americas greatest comparative advantages among the worlds nations. Of course The Heartland Institute has been working with EPA on policy and personnel decisions Tim Huelskamp a former Kansas Republican congressman who now leads the group said in a statement. They recognised us as the pre eminent organisation opposing the radical climate alarmism agenda and instead promoting sound science and policy Huelskamp wrote. He said Heartland would continue to help Pruitt and his staff. Ferguson said Pruitt and his top officials had also met with groups known for their campaigns against climate changing emissions and pollutants from fossil fuels including the Moms Clean Air Force the American Lung Association and others. But Ben Levitan of the Environmental Defence Fund said mainstream climate change groups have received nothing like the outreach and invitations that Heartland and other hard right groups have been getting. Certainly in some ways this is normal and in the course of business that ebbs and flows with the ideology of the administration in power said Meredith McGehee executive director of Issue One a not for profit group promoting ethical government and bipartisan political reform. An email last February shows Bast forwarded to followers an email with the line From the White House rallying activists to public hearings the EPA was then holding around the country on repealing an Obama era power plan meant to curb fossil fuel emissions. The email is signed by a Pruitt political appointee and gives the name of another EPA official for activists to call. Its not clear from the email however who initiated the attempt to rally conservatives for the public hearing. The Washington Post reported in September that Konkus had been scrutinising grant applications for mentions of climate change which he reportedly calls the double C word. Emails show he and former EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman repeatedly reached out to Heartland to talk over critical coverage by the Post. Lakely the Heartland spokesman responded that he had shared the article with colleagues asking them to jump to your aide sic and defend this position. And an email from Bast shared with EPA staffers and others shows the then Heartland president celebrating news that a reporter Justin Gillis was leaving the New York Times. Ding Dong the Witch is Dead. Still waiting for Chris Mooney and Juliet Eilperin at the WaPo and Seth Borenstein at AP to flame out Bast writes.	True	False	False	True	True
Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden really grabbed the audiences eyes at the climate change town hall literally as his eye filled with blood after a lackluster performance marked by half truths and excuses. The former Vice President was clearly floundering during CNNs climate change town hall on Wednesday which saw him face off against eight other Democrats. Viewers called him out for rambling incoherent answers and held his feet to the fire regarding his coziness with the fossil fuel industry. Then his left eye began filling up with blood. At around the same time his campaign cautioned voters not to turn a blind eye to the way in which environmental burdens are distributed unevenly along racial and socioeconomic lines an ironic coincidence or a sly reference to the unusual anatomic event? Before Bidens eye exploded the audience had been raking him over the coals for a scheduled fundraiser the following night at the home of a natural gas executive. The three time candidate has never been particularly committed to green issues slammed by environmental groups for not having a climate change policy he finally released one in June that contained several plagiarized items. But he had along with most of the other Democratic candidates promised not to take money from the fossil fuel industry a promise the fundraiser seemed to break to viewers dismay. But even the most blatant political hypocrisy was no match for the eye. Look Biden haters sometimes your eye is gonna spontaneously fill up with blood okay one user joked. Twitter furiously deploying algorithms to keep Bidens bloody corpse eye from trending observed another it appeared to work while was trending and variations thereof were noticeably not. Apparently it wasnt even the first time Bidens eye has filled up with blood during an important political event. But some commenters found a way to bring the conversation back to the environment. Not sure after tonight who has less time to live Biden or the planet said one. Joe Biden lied so hard during the climate town hall that his eye started bleeding commented another. I give it 14 minutes before Bidens campaign says his bloody eye was because of climate change predicted another. Meanwhile others made the inevitable comparisons to Hillary Clinton another candidate with a marked enthusiasm gap between donors and voters who has run for president and lost before yet is propped up by the media as the surefire winner. And some took time out from gawking to worry about his health since political speeches dont normally cause visible injury. Does Biden have a blood clot in his left eye? wondered one user. This cant be good news given his health history noted another. Like this story? Share it with a friend!	True	True	False	True	True
WASHINGTON The Senate on Thursday confirmed former coal industry lobbyist Andrew Wheeler to lead the Environmental Protection Agency despite concerns by Democrats and one Republican about regulatory rollbacks hes made in eight months as the agencys acting chief. Senators voted 52 47 to confirm Wheeler who was nominated by President Donald Trump after former administrator Scott Pruitt resigned last year amid a series of ethics allegations. Sen. John Barrasso R Wyo. chairman of the Senate environment committee called Wheeler uniquely qualified to lead EPA and said that under Wheeler the agency is putting forward proposals that both protect our environment and allow the countrys economy to flourish. But Sen. Tom Udall D N.M. said Wheeler was failing to protect the environment and human health and was nominated to unravel and undo the environmental protections that are now in place. Wheeler 54 was confirmed as deputy administrator last April and became acting chief in July after Pruitt resigned. He worked at the EPA early in his career and was a top aide at the Senate Environment Committee before becoming a lobbyist a decade ago. Maine Sen. Susan Collins was the sole Republican to oppose Wheeler. She said in a statement that unlike Pruitt Wheeler understands the mission of the EPA and acts in accordance with ethical standards. However the policies he has supported as acting administrator are not in the best interest of our environment and public health particularly given the threat of climate change to our nation. Collins said she was particularly concerned that EPA has proposed to roll back rules regulating mercury emissions from power plants and moved to replace the Clean Power Plan former President Barack Obamas signature proposal to combat climate change. There is no doubt that the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change pose a significant threat to Maine and the nation Collins said adding that pollution from coal fired power plants threatens Maines natural resources from our working forests fishing and agricultural industries to tourism and recreation. VIDEO At his confirmation hearing in January Wheeler told lawmakers that climate change is a huge issue but not the greatest crisis. Video by PBS NewsHour Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia who supported Wheelers nomination as deputy last year voted against his promotion. Wheeler was not making meaningful progress on clean water standards Manchin said citing the agencys failure to limit the amount of highly toxic chemicals contaminating drinking water in West Virginia and around the country. The EPA has announced plans to place legal limits on the chemicals but has not yet done so. The perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances known collectively as PFAS have been linked to health threats ranging from cancer to decreased fertility. I believe immediate action must be taken and these efforts lack a sense of urgency Manchin said. Like Collins Manchin also said he was concerned at EPAs attempt to undo rules designed to limit emissions of mercury which can damage the brains of infants and young children. Environmental groups meanwhile slammed Wheeler saying that while his behavior is less cartoonish than Pruitt he supports the same policies. Wheeler wants to turn the EPA into a wish granting service for polluters no matter the cost to public health or wildlife. But its only a matter of time before his dirty dealings land him in the same trash heap as his predecessor said Emily Knobbe EPA policy specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity an Arizona based environmental group. Americas Power a trade group that represents coal producers applauded Wheelers confirmation. During his time as acting administrator Andrew Wheeler has been seen as a thoughtful leader who understands the need for sensible environmental policies said Michelle Bloodworth the groups president and CEO. Wheelers long experience in public service demonstrates his integrity in serving EPAs mission she said.

Jellyfish numbers have been increasing rapidly in the Mediterranean and one species that has long been a hazard for bathers there the mauve stinger is increasingly being seen around the British Isles. Now one marine biologist says if we can't beat them we should eat them. I'm hovering in a makeshift kitchen watching one of Italy's most eminent marine biologists gleefully playing chef. Prof Silvio Greco is focused on the bubbling contents of a large pot. Dressed up for the part in chef's whites traditional hat and red apron the sustainable conservation expert is perfect for the role. In this water I have put lemon juice and vinegar. After boiling for a few minutes I will plunge it into this ice he gestures explaining how the hot water both sterilises getting rid of bacteria and destroys the stinging poison. What for some might be food hell has got my tastebuds jumping with curious excitement we're about to eat jellyfish. For Greco it's not the first time. I love seafood he beams. Jellyfish remind me of oysters. When you eat them you experience an explosion of the sea on your tongue. They are after all 90 seawater. Today he's enlisted the professional help of restaurant chef Marco Visciola who confesses he's never cooked jellyfish before. He's going to fry it in a tempura batter made of potato wheat and rice flours mixed with sparkling water. No salt? I ask. Zero he tells me. The jellyfish already has the salty flavour of the sea so to bring out its flavour I've left the batter neutral. This isn't some perverse chef's challenge but part of a campaign that Greco is promoting at the Slow Fish festival. Held every two years at Genoa's porto antico the event encourages sustainable fishing and responsible consumption. There are at least four times as many jellyfish in the Mediterranean now as there were in 2004 with global climate change pollution and overfishing mostly to blame. And the message this cooking demo is sending out is if you can't defeat them eat them. The sea is full of them and it's a big problem for biodiversity says Silvio Greco describing jellyfish as rampant opportunistic species that immediately take over any empty space in the water. He explains how their spread is devastating marine food chains and ecosystems and how illegal fishing of natural jellyfish predators like tuna and turtles has left the coast clear for them to multiply. Now man he concludes must be the new predator of jellyfish. It's an idea the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization is encouraging too. For years fishermen have been finding their nets increasingly burdened with unwanted jellyfish that they simply throw back into the sea. Silvio Greco hopes this will change and says that sustainability aside jellyfish is actually good for you rich in protein and collagen low in calories and fat free. At Slow Fish I discover the eat it to beat it approach isn't limited to the Mediterranean. There's a Caribbean delegation of fishers researchers and marine biologists here to pool ideas on how to fight their worst invasive species the lionfish. They are trying to get it on to menus from Mexico to Honduras Costa Rica to Barbados. Its tender meat which apparently tastes like snapper certainly sounds more appetising than jellyfish. But the jellyfish cooking demo is without a doubt the biggest crowd puller of the entire festival. As the tray of fresh medusa fritta is passed around eager fingers grab the piping hot morsels. I select my piece. The tempura is exquisite cracking seductively between my teeth. I'd expected the jellyfish to be chewy like calamari but it's squidgier. It might just be because I'm hungry but I really like it. A young woman exclaims it's surprisingly nice while a Taiwanese lady tells me jellyfish is a common antipasto back home and she was curious to see what the Italians would do with it. The man beside me is unimpressed. The batter's nice but the jellyfish tastes of nothing and it's slippery he grumbles. I ask a three year old what she thinks. Yummy or yucky? Yummy! she grins at me chewing happily. She was probably hungry too. Marco Visciola has also made a boiled jellyfish salad with rice vinegar sesame oil carrot and cucumber a traditional recipe a Japanese colleague gave him. Again I'm impressed although I think jellyfish's neutral taste or lack of taste could lend itself to any decisive flavours. But Marco's sold. For me it was a new experience and there were a lot of curious people he enthuses adding that he now plans to put locally caught jellyfish on his restaurant's summer menu. It's a novelty a chef can offers diners. I think it will become popular. I'm not entirely convinced. But if you never want another seaside holiday to be ruined by a coastal jellyfish invasion perhaps it really is time to stop fretting and start frying.

Young students across the world plan to skip class on Friday claiming that they will devote the day to protesting man made climate change. Students from more than 70 countries will skip class on Friday March 15 to demand that their governments take more action on addressing climate change according to a youth led movement that is behind the strike. Tens of thousands of students will reportedly take part in the event. We will no longer accept this injustice. We demand justice for all past current and future victims of the climate crisis and so we are rising up read an open letter that the activists published on the Guardian claiming they would be protesting on every continent on Friday. Thousands of us have taken to the streets in the past weeks all around the world. Now we will make our voices heard. 350.org an international environmental group is helping bolster the strike with its own promotional video. Activists are hoping to closely mirror the youth led March For Our Lives protests in Washington D.C. which took place nearly a year ago following the fatal Parkland Florida school shooting and spark more debate among lawmakers about the dangers of climate change. Activists in the U.S. are making similar demands that are found in Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortezs Green New Deal a swift transition to 100 percent renewable energy a complete abolition of fossil fuels and other environmental mandates. The group strongly references the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes 2018 report which claims the world only has a few year to dramatically reduce carbon emissions or else face dire environmental consequences. RELATEDThousands Of Students Ditch Class To Join Climate Change Protests We have the right to live our dreams and hopes the letter continues. Climate change is already happening. People did die are dying and will die because of it but we can and will stop this madness. The protesters in Washington D.C. will enjoy the presence of one well known adult figure Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar. The freshman Democrat who has made national headlines recently for a slew of anti Semitic remarks says she will attend the strike along with her 16 year old daughter Isra Hirsi an organizer of the protest.

Environmental concerns are real but the planet still will be here in twelve years. Imagine theres a movie about a meteor heading toward Earth. It will be here in twelve years. Following Hollywood convention once you got past the part where the maverick scientist or precocious kid discovering it struggles to convince the world about the threat youd expect the president or the military to leap into action. Congress is usually left out of such plots but its not a stretch to imagine that Congress would race to authorize a plan to send astronauts into space to prevent Armageddon or a planetary deep impact. If you dont believe me I refer you to the movies Armageddon and Deep Impact. The initial rollout of the Green New Deal a sweeping proposal to overhaul the U.S. economy and taken seriously society itself was supposed to follow a script like this. The United Nations opened the bidding by announcing last year that we had twelve years to keep the pace of climate change from accelerating too fast to contain the damage. Like a high school game of telephone this quickly became a blanket statement that we have twelve years to save the planet. Climate change is a real concern but if we did absolutely nothing to stop it the planet would still be here in a dozen years. So would the human race and many other living things. In fact if America did virtually everything the Green New Dealers propose global emissions of greenhouse gases wouldnt change that much unless China India Russia and all the African nations followed suit. There are people who nonetheless believe that climate change is a world threatening calamity and that exaggeration is a necessary tool to galvanize public opinion. If you Google the phrase twelve years to save the planet youll find people who think its literally true. The problem is that weve heard these things before. In 1989 a U.N. official predicted entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000. In 2008 Al Gore warned that the northern polar ice cap could be gone in five years. Melting polar ice is something to worry about but its not gone. The reasons this is a political problem for climate change warriors should be obvious. First they are their own worst enemy when it comes to maintaining credibility. By working on the theory that they have to scare the bejeebus out of the public they made it easy for people to dismiss them when their Chicken Little prophecies didnt materialize. Another problem which compounds the first is that they get greedy. Working on the premise that a crisis is a terrible thing to waste progressives have a long record of trying to throw other items on their wish list into the anti climate change shopping cart. The Green New Deal as presented by Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D. N.Y. includes high quality health care for everyone guaranteed jobs paid vacations a living wage and retirement security. Indeed its worth remembering that environmentalists targeted the fossil fuel industry for early retirement long before concerns about global warming were on the agenda. The anti oil campaign began with the Santa Barbara oil spill in 1969 back when concerns about another ice age were still taken seriously. You can believe that climate change is a real problem and also be forgiven for thinking progressives are trying to pull a fast one. This is especially so when you consider that proponents of the GND also favor phasing out nuclear power which could provide vastly more electricity than wind or solar and more efficiently. Which gets me back to where I started. Imagine there was a movie about an incoming meteor that could be stopped only with a nuclear warhead and the heroes insisted that nuclear weapons are just too icky to use even to save the planet. Audiences would scratch their heads. They might also think they missed a crucial plot point if the protagonists proposed a sweeping government effort to stop the meteor and then when given the opportunity to vote for it voted present in protest. Thats similar to what happened this week. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell brought the Green New Deal to the floor for a vote and Democrats refused to vote for it. Instead they harangued McConnell for pulling a stunt. They were right. It was a stunt. But sometimes it takes a stunt to expose an even bigger one.	True	True	True	True	False
The EPAs decision was not unexpected. During the 2016 presidential campaign Trump said the United States faces numerous problems more important than climate change and he pledged to eliminate environmental policies hampering economic growth and domestic energy development targeting the CPP by name. As part of Trumps March 28 Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth executive order Trump directed EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to review CPP and rescind or revise it if necessary to promote the wise development of natural resources unencumber energy production and increase jobs. The EPA based the decision to rescind CPP on three main principles CPP is inconsistent with the 1970 Clean Air Act CPP violated states authority to decide the best mix of power generation within their borders and eroded longstanding federalstate partnerships necessary to achieve environmental improvement and enforcement of CPP would have had a devastating effect on jobs and raised energy costs for consumersall while having virtually no effect on climate change. CPP was the centerpiece of the Obama administrations effort to move the United States away from the use of fossil fuels beginning with coal to fight climate change. CPP would require states to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 on average. To comply with the plan states would have to force utilities to shutter dozens of coal fired power plants prematurely. The Energy Information Administration projected CPP would result in 1.23 trillion in lost gross domestic product GDP in 2014 dollars from 2020 to 2030 with an average annual GDP loss of 112 billion. Estimates indicate CPP would boost peoples electric bills 1114 percent per year and cost more than 100000 jobs in manufacturing and other sectors annually. Despite these substantial harms the Obama administration acknowledged in testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Science Space and Technology on July 9 2015 that if the United States met CPPs emission reductions targets it would prevent at best one one hundredth ofone degree Celsius of temperature rise by 2100. Talk about all pain and no gain! Twenty seven states led by West Virginia and several industry groups and trade associations challenged CPPs legality in federal court. In February 2016 the U.S. Supreme Court took the unprecedented step of ordering a nationwide stay on implementation of CPP before it went into effect pending the outcome of the legal challenges. CPP would have dramatically raised energy costs in United States harming the poorest among us more than the rest and putting U.S. industries at a competitive disadvantage in the global economy. By rescinding it Trump is doing what he promised to do and what any president should do putting America first. Bravo! Having said this unless Trump wants these gains to unravel he has at least one more step to take. Environmental groups and some state government officials have already announced that if the CPP rescission is finalized they will sue to block the Trump administrations action to keep CPP on the books. In truth this presents a problem for Trump. CPP and the other climate regulations imposed by the Obama administration were justified based on the EPAs determination carbon dioxide poses a threat to human health and the environment a concept known as the endangerment finding. Relying on unsubstantiated projections produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the EPA determined carbon dioxide emissions from cars and industry threaten human welfare. To solidify his CPP action and other climate deregulatory efforts Trump must direct the EPA to reconsider the endangerment finding by forcing the agency to demonstratethrough independent validated researchcarbon dioxide emissions are toxic they arent at any foreseeable levels or that global warming is causing measurable amounts of sea level rise increased hurricane numbers or intensity the spread of disease or other harms attributable directly to carbon dioxide emissions in the United States. If the EPA cant directly link such problems to U.S. carbon dioxide emissions it cant or cant show that such problems can be dramatically reduced by cutting U.S. carbon dioxide emissions they wont the EPA should withdraw the endangerment finding. Withdrawing the endangerment finding would eliminate the legal justification that has been used to impose a wide range of climate regulations. In the process it would also end radical environmental activists ability to use the courts to impose policies on an unwilling publicone whose elected representatives have repeatedly rejected climate alarmism.

Rocks from northern Labrador have been found to contain the oldest known evidence of life on Earth. Graphite a form of pure carbon found in the 3.95 billion year old rocks shows the geochemical signature of having come from the decomposition of living organisms researchers report in a new study published today in Nature. That's at least 150 million years older than the oldest graphite from living organisms previously found in 3.7 billion to 3.8 billion year old rocks in Greenland and northern Quebec. It's also not much more than 500 million years after the Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago. Some of the signatures in the Labrador rocks suggests that the organisms that left them were autotrophic that is they could produce their own food from chemicals in their environment as algae and some kinds of bacteria do report researchers led by Takayuki Tashiro and Tsuyoshi Komiya at the University of Tokyo. The discovery suggests not only that there may have been life but there may have been abundant enough life that you could get carbon rich sediments said Beth Ann Bell a geochemist at the University of California Los Angeles who was not involved in the study but called the findings pretty cool. It adds to evidence that the Earth at that time had surface water and other conditions to support life and wasn't as hot and as inhospitable as scientists used to think said Daniele Pinti a geochemist at the University of Quebec at Montreal. He was also not involved in the study but supervised one of the co authors Pauline Mjean during her PhD in Canada. Pinti said that researchers have been increasingly interested in the rocks of the Uivak Gneiss in the Saglek Block of northern Labrador in recent years because they contain some of the oldest rocks on the surface of the Earth. Such old rocks are very rare because the Earth's crust is constantly being recycled back into the planet's interior through a process called plate tectonics. The Labrador rocks are likely a small patch that remains from a very ancient continent Pinti said It's a very special place. Because such rocks are so rare very little is known about the Earth at that time although it's known that the interior of the Earth was much hotter than it is now and there is some evidence of liquid water on the surface. Were there ponds? Were there oceans? That's uncertain Bell said. What makes the Labrador rocks particularly special is that they are the oldest known metasedimentary rocks in the world. That is they were originally formed from sediments deposited by water the type of environment that decaying organic remains often end up in said Bell. The meta part of the word indicates that the rocks have been metamorphosed or transformed by heat and pressure over time They've been cooked pretty well Bell explains. That makes them harder to analyze but not impossible. Graphite the dark substance found in pencil leads can be formed from chemical reactions of inorganic minerals such as limestone. But it can also be formed when decaying organic matter gets heated up to several hundred degrees. Scientists can tell the difference by looking at the type of carbon found in the graphite. Carbon atoms come in different isotopes or forms with different masses carbon 12 carbon 13 and carbon 14 which you may have heard of because it's used in radiocarbon dating. Carbon 12 is the most common and the kind that organisms tend to disproportionately take into their bodies. That means graphite that comes from living things tends to be lighter than graphite from inorganic sources. To figure out whether graphite came from a living or non living source researchers use instruments to compare the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13. Of course things get more complicated when the graphite has been exposed to heat and pressure which can change the carbon ratios. There's also the possibility that the rocks could have become contaminated in the nearly four billion years after they were formed. But the researchers took great pains to test for contamination account for the exposure to heat and pressure and extrapolate back the original ratios Pinti said. For the moment it looks very convincing he added. Pinti said one interesting thing about the carbon signature is that it can indicate not just whether the graphite came from living organisms but what kind of metabolism those organisms had. The researchers write that the ratio found in one sample provides the oldest evidence for autotrophs organisms that can produce their own food either through photosynthesis or by using inorganic compounds such as sulphur in their environment. In this case the organisms appear to use a metabolic pathwaysimilar to modern microbes that turn carbon dioxide into methane and acetate.

The Trump administration spent time last year mulling over what its public position on climate science should be and according to a report published Wednesday by The Washington Post outrightly ignoring new research was one option that officials considered. Citing an internal memo drafted in September by President Donald Trumps then top energy and environmental aide Michael Catanzaro the Post reported that White House officials had discussed whether to consider having a firm position on and a coherent fact based message about climate science specifically whether and to what extent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are affecting the climate system and what level of concern that warrants. Three options were reportedly presented in the memo The first was to conduct red teamblue teamdebates to highlight uncertainties in climate data the second was to review scientific studies under the Administrative Procedure Act and the final option was to simply ignore and not seek to characterize or question the science being conducted by Federal agencies and outside entities. No formal policy ever did materialize from the memo or subsequent discussions on the issue. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt was reportedly an advocate of holding red teamblue teamdebates to publicly critique climate science but that idea wasultimately blocked by the White House reported The New York Times in March. As the Post noted the Catanzaro memo offers a glimpse into the challenges faced by the Trump administration on the issue of climate change.While White House officials continue to publicly downplay climate data and adopt policies to expand fossil fuel production in the U.S. federal agencies have continued to publish research showing that climate change is real man made and a growing threat to the U.S. On Friday for instance the National Park Service published a report that said the effects of climate change like rising sea levels and intensifying stormscould damage park sites across the country. The reports lead researcher had earlier accused the Trump administration of attempting to censor the study by removing all mentions of human caused climate change. Ignoring the overwhelming evidence only sets us back further in addressing this serious threat said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen D N.H.. Ignore distort or censor. Those are the options the Trump White House is considering to deal with the overwhelming consensus on climate change. Unacceptable and immoral. We need a vision and a plan to not willful ignorance.

President Trumps claim that Californias environmental policies are preventing firefighters from accessing enough water to stop the states wildfires has been roundly dismissed by experts and state officials. Windy conditions and high heat expanded the Mendocino Complex Fire to 290692 acresby Tuesday morning making it the largest wildfire in the states history destroying some 75 homes and forcing thousands to evacuate. Seven other major wildfires are burning in California from Shasta County to San Bernardino County at the same time. Trump made the dubious claim that readily available water is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean for environmental reasons and blamed California Gov. Jerry Brown in a series of tweets. California wildfires are being magnified made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which arent allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized. It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire from spreading! Trump tweeted on Monday. Yahoo News reached out to Scott McLean a deputy chief at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Cal Fire to get the agencys take on Trumps claims and whats actually happening in the efforts to stop the Mendocino Complex and other wildfires. He outright rejected the assertion that firefighters do not have enough water to handle the current wildfires. No that is untrue. There are bodies of water. There are lakes near the Carr Fire the Shasta Lake the Whiskeytown Lake thats surrounded by the fire Trinity Lake we have plenty of water Sacramento River is just to the east McLean said. On your Mendocino Complex its wrapped around Clear Lake. Its got Mendocino Lake Berryessa Lake and it has a river close by so there are absolutely no water issues. We asked why Trump was saying that the states water is being redirecting into the ocean and where that idea originated. I cannot speak to that. I dont know what hes getting at. I have no idea McLean said. He added that Californias water policy has had no effect to our water supply. On top of calling climate change a hoax Trump has been critical of the U.S. Forest Services forest fire prevention campaign with Smokey Bear. Kate Poole the senior director of the Natural Resources Defense Councils NRDC water division said its hard to know where to begin in responding to Trumps tweets because theyre fundamentally wrong on many levels. She said the firefighters have plenty of water adding that the fires are a manifestation of the effects of climate change. These fires are what it means in the West to live with higher temperatures less snowpack and more frequent and intense droughts. All of those problems are a result of climate change. Wheres the presidents outrage about that? Wed even settle for a coherent policy to tackle it rather than make it worse Poole told Yahoo News. She said Trump in complaining about water diverted to the Pacific seems to not understand that rivers flow downhill toward the ocean. On the contrary she said California diverts so much water from its natural path and into artificial canals that many miles of rivers have dried up completely. She said this caused ecological collapse in the San Francisco Bay Delta estuary the largest estuary on the west coast of the Americas.	True	False	False	True	True
As protesters prepare for nationwide demonstrations against Donald Trumps environmental agenda Bernie Sanders on Thursday backed legislation that would phase out the use of fossil fuels in the US by 2050. Mr President start listening to the people and the scientists not the greed of the fossil fuel industry Sanders said at a rally on Capitol Hill where he was flanked by environmental advocates and two of his Democratic colleagues Senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon who authored the bill and Ed Markey of Massachusetts. As you all know the Vermont senator and former presidential candidate told the crowd Donald Trump is wrong about a lot of things. But there is no area where he is more wrong than on the issue of climate change. Sanders added No Mr President climate change is not a hoax. Climate change is real. At the event held just outside the US Capitol Sanders Merkley and Markey unveiled legislation which seeks to completely phase out the use of fossil fuels through a transition to 100 clean and renewable energy by the middle of this century. But the bill called the 100 by 50 Act is unlikely to be considered by a Republican controlled Congress where many GOP lawmakers are still unwilling to acknowledge the science behind global warming and contribution of human activity. The partisan nature of the debate was not lost on the audience as one attendee interrupted the proceedings to ask Where are the Republicans? Were going to have to recruit those colleagues across the aisle said Merkley who ranks among the Senates most progressive voices. This is not a red or a blue issue he said. There is no excuse for failure. This is the biggest test facing human civilization and we have to respond and win this battle. Demonstrators are set to gather in Washington for the Peoples Climate March on Saturday which will also mark the 100th day of the Trump administration. Similar marches are expected in major cities across the US as part of a broader effort to oppose Trumps efforts to roll back the climate initiatives put in place by Barack Obama. The president has signaled his intentions to tear up the landmark Paris climate agreement forged by more than 195 nations in late 2015 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 over a decade. Trumps top aides who are split on whether or not the US should remain part of the Paris accord were scheduled to meet on Thursday afternoon to discuss the deals future. Trumps chief of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt is a vocal proponent of pulling out immediately. Trump has vowed to withdraw from the Paris agreement and has already taken steps through executive action to begin the process of overturning Obama era environmental regulations. Among them was a directive to the EPA to dismantle the Clean Power Plan one of Obamas signature climate policies to reduce carbon pollution from power plants. Trump also signed an executive order that aims to unravel the Obama rule designed to protect American waterways from pollution and proposed in his budget draconian cuts to the EPA. At the rally Markey said Trumps actions were precisely why hundreds of thousands of people felt compelled to take to the streets. Donald Trump is still saying that hes going to issue a new executive order allowing for more oil drilling on the public lands of the United States of America he said drawing jeers for the president from the crowd. That is just completely and totally unacceptable.	True	False	False	True	False
The Trump administration has proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act ESA a law credited with keeping hundreds of species from going extinct. The change would eliminate automatic protections for threatened plant and animal species and make it easier for species to be removed from the list. Wildlife conservation groups say the proposed change could have disastrous lasting effects on at risk species. Trump officials say the change will streamline the regulatory process. The proposed change is the latest in a series of White House efforts to remove environmental regulations designed to protect vulnerable species and their habitats as well as leave untouched some of America's most wild places. Environmentalist groups have reacted with outrage and the Center for Biological Diversity said these proposals would slam a wrecking ball into the most crucial protections for our most endangered wildlife. If these regulations had been in place in the 1970s the bald eagle and the grey whale would be extinct today. The Endangered Species Act was signed into law in 1973 by Republican President Richard Nixon and now protects more than 1200 plant and animal species. The list of species is maintained by US Fish and Wildlife and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration which oversees marine species. It has been credited with reviving bald eagle populations and bringing the Yellowstone grizzly bear back from the edge of extinction. Here are several species that could be affected by the change or may not currently exist if it was not for the landmark law. Experts agree that arctic sea ice which polar bears require for fishing and hunting is shrinking which is leading to enormous stresses on the world's largest bear species. The proposed change to the ESA includes a narrowing of the definition of foreseeable future. The US government says they want the language clarified to make it clear that it extends only as far as wildlife officials can reasonably determine that both the future threats and the species' response to those threats are probable. Environmentalists fear the new language will make it possible for government biologists to disregard the long term effects of climate change on the environment. The polar bear could be emblematic of many species being affected by climate change says Bob Dreher of the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife. Whether government biologists will recognise this slow acting but inevitable change in ecosystem because of climate change or wait until more evidence is available is unclear he tells the BBC. The ESA provides blanket protections to species which are categorised as either threatened such as the California gnatcatcher or endangered. Endangered species are those likely to go extinct while threatened species are those likely to become endangered. Under current law both are granted critical habitat protections but the Trump administration wants automatic protections for threatened species to be eliminated and in the future to be considered on a case by case basis. Protections for the California gnatcatcher have barred development across nearly 100000 acres of land in the Greater Los Angeles area according to the Los Angeles Times. If not for their current protections their native habitat would likely become part of more urban sprawl. The sage grouse has been a candidate for protection as a threatened species for nearly a decade but it is unclear if it will ever be added. They as well as the dunes sagebrush lizard have seen their territory encroached upon by human development and have seen decreasing populations in recent years. The distinctive sage grouse return to their breeding grounds known as Leks every year. Biologists believe some Leks can be hundreds of years old. If the sage grouse does achieve threatened status environmentalists fear under the new Trump proposal it would be too late for them to gain the broad protections they need. Although the proposed change would only affect future creatures joining the list Mr Dreher says that if the proposed rules had been in effect in the 1970s animals such as wolves and bald eagles may have been extinct by now. In a significant reversal the proposed change would eliminate language that precludes wildlife experts from considering economic impacts when determining when an organism should be listed. Wolves which were re introduced in the lower 48 states have faced criticism from ranchers and farmers who argue that they have impacted their livelihood by killing their livestock. Re introducing them to the continental US came at great cost and effort says Mr Dreher a former US Fish and Wildlife official. Mr Dreher says that the ESA was designed by Congress to say that the value of life on earth is priceless and that politicians should not have to decide whether it is too expensive to prevent extinction. If we made those decisions you can see under different administrations we would end up protecting nothing. Because who knows what a snail is worth? Who knows what a frog is worth?

The US Environmental Protection Agencys main climate change website is undergoing changes to better reflect the agencys new direction under Donald Trump. The announcement made late on Friday evening left empty what was previously the official government site providing comprehensive information on the issue of climate change and global warming. The change came a day before thousands gathered in Washington DC and other US cities to protest about inaction on climate change and hours before the symbolic 100 day mark of the Trump administration. At the marquee climate protest the Peoples Climate March in Washington tens of thousands made their way down Pennsylvania Avenue in sweltering heat on their way to encircle the White House. Organizers said about 300 sister marches or rallies were being held around the country including in Seattle Boston and San Francisco. In Chicago marchers headed from the citys federal plaza to Trump Tower. In Denver marchers were met with a dose of spring snow. Some of the marches drew celebrity attendees including former vice president Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio in the capital and senator and former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Bernie Sanders at an event in Montpelier Vermont. Honored to join Indigenous leaders and native peoples as they fight for climate justice DiCaprio tweeted. Any marchers who used their phones to look at the EPA climate change website would have been greeted with a message from the new administration This page is being updated. As EPA renews its commitment to human health and clean air land and water our website needs to reflect the views of the leadership of the agency said JP Freire an associate administrator for public affairs. Previously the website housed data on greenhouse gas emissions from large polluters and reports on the effects of climate change and its impact on human health. We want to eliminate confusion Freire said by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how were protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law. Information from previous administrations is archived as a link from the EPAs website. The EPA is currently led by Scott Pruitt a former Oklahoma attorney general who has denied that carbon dioxide causes global warming. The Trump administration has called for budget cuts of nearly one third at the EPA and has sought to weaken protections for human health. For instance the White House has proposed cutting funding and regulations regarding lead poisoning prevention and is considering rewriting regulations concerning smog. It has already rolled back a law that prevented coalmining companies from dumping waste in streams. In an op ed piece for the Guardian published on Saturday Sanders made an economic case for a focus on industries meant to ameliorate the effects of climate change rather than those which contribute to it. The senator from Vermont wrote No matter what agenda President Trump and his administration of climate deniers push it is clear that jobs in clean energy like wind and solar are growing much more rapidly than jobs in the coal oil and gas sectors.

In April for the first time ever the US produced more energy from renewable sources than from coal in a single month. According to data from the US Energy Information Administration hydroelectric dams solar panels and wind turbines generated 68.5 million megawatt hours of energy during the month of April 2019. This was compared to 60 million megawatt hours of energy produced from coal in the same month. The trend comes despite President Donald Trump pledging to 'bring back' the coal industry which has been hit hard by competition from cheaper natural gas and renewable energy. The US has been shifting toward natural gas which is not only cheaper than coal but also emits less carbon dioxide. However experts noted that several coal plants were down for routine maintenance in April and the month saw an increase in wind generation and a drop in energy demand. This suggests that coal could easily take over from renewable sources in the following months. Despite this areport from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis IEEFA said that the trend could potentially extend into the month of May. The trend will happen sporadically throughout the next several years says the IEEFA as renewable energy becomes cheaper and the world's attention focuses on mitigating the effects of carbon fueled climate change by turning away from fossil fuels. Growth in both solar and wind power has been particularly stark with the former producing 48 times more electricity than it did a decade ago due to cheaper equipment and government incentives. Coupled with a rise in renewables has been a trend of declining coal consumption. Last year coal hit a nearly 40 year low in terms of proportional usage in the U.S. Coal has fallen out of favor in part due to decreasing costs of natural gas. In 2016 it was dethroned as the America's fuel of choice by natural gas a feat aided in part by a thriving hydro fracking industry that continues to pump abundant fossil fuels out of the Bakken Oil Shale in North Dakota. The Trump administration on Wednesday completed one of its biggest rollbacks of environmental rules replacing a landmark Obama era effort that sought to wean the nation's electrical grid off coal fired power plants and their climate damaging pollution. Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler a former coal industry lobbyist signed a replacement rule that gives states leeway in deciding whether to require efficiency upgrades at existing coal plants. Wheeler said coal fired power plants remained essential to the power grid something that opponents deny. 'Americans want reliable energy that they can afford' he said at a news conference. There's no denying 'the fact that fossil fuels will continue to be an important part of the mix' he said.	True	True	False	True	False
The failure of carbon tax proposals to catch on in the U.S. and around the world is prompting environmentalists to give up hope of ever implementing it. Carbon fees were once considered an obvious next step in the countrys multifaceted effort to reduce CO2 emissions. Congresswoman elect Alexandria Ocasio Cortez a rising star on the left believes a carbon tax can be one part of her sweeping Green New Deal. Some conservatives have signed on to the idea believing it to be a market based approach to eliminating pollution. Even a number of major energy companies have come forward in support of charging businesses for the amount of carbon they release into the atmosphere. However carbon tax proposals have proven unsuccessful time and time again. Initiative 1631 for example was supposed to serve as a bellwether for how similar legislation could fare across the country. The bill whichcalled for a 15 fee on each metric ton of carbon emissions was put to the test in Washington state during the 2018 midterm elections. Despite the states Democratic lean and the governors public backing the measure was soundly rejectedin November. It was the second time voters in the state had rejected a carbon fee. Such a proposal being rejected in a blue state doesnt bode well for activists who hope to see it implemented nationwide. If it cant pass in Washington state right now Im not sure that says that theres much of a pathway at this moment nationally Washington Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley said of the outcome. Events across the Atlantic have only worsened prospects for carbon tax supporters. In the face of unprecedented protests the French government has decided to suspend a planned gas tax. President Emmanuel Macros had originally proposed a slew of new carbon taxes intended to wean consumers off fossil fuels and transition to electric vehicles. The price hikes however triggered a wave of intense riots. The protests which have lasted for weeks have even become deadly. One man was caught on video over the weekend losing his hand to a grenade explosion. Theres been a predominant conversation in Washington D.C. thats been led by economists and politicos that have tried to frame a carbon tax as the only way Evan Weber a national political director for the Sunrise Movement said to Politico. Its proved time and time again to be not politically popular and we havent even priced the policy at where economists say it needs to be. The idea that a carbon fee is the way out of this mess is something we need to be pushing back on. RELATED Keep It In The Ground Activists Stormed Trump Administrations Event At UN Meeting Activists will instead focus on other causes near and dear to the environmental movement such as pushing energy standards that mandate a total transition to clean and renewable energy. While many have expressed dissolution over the prospect of a carbon tax future other green activists plan to keep charging forward with their own proposals. Supporters plan to introduce various carbon fee bills across state capitols in 2019 including Pennsylvania New York New Jersey Maryland and New England.

It was not hard for Beto ORourke to seem like a champion of green issues during his eye catching Senate campaign in Americas 2018 midterm elections after all he was up against Ted Cruz a climate change denier. Now as the former US congressman vies to be the Democratic candidate to run against Donald Trump in the 2020 race for the White House he faces much closer scrutiny on the subject. Environmental advocates and experts wait to see if as ORourke pivots from an election in a conservative led oil state to a national primary race heavily influenced by left leaning Democratic candidates he will have more latitude and desire to put progressive green policies at the heart of his strategy. He didnt really emphasise climate change and global warming very much when he was running against Ted Cruz but hes got a field that is absolutely filled with people who are making it a campaign item for voters to consider and I think hes going to have to adjust his narrative when hes out on the trail said Robert Forbis an assistant professor of political science at Texas Tech University. Hes going to have to take a pretty strong stand. The seeds of a decisive and urgent approach were visible in his first campaign visits to Iowa in March when ORourke praised the radical climate change led proposals in the Green New Deal citing his home states struggles with extreme weather such as droughts and hurricanes. Storms like Harvey are only going to become more frequent and more severe and more devastating and ultimately theyll compromise the ability to live in a city like Houston Texas he told the audience. ORourke signalled support for reducing the countrys dependence on fossil fuels and investing in green technology to reach net zero emissions. Some will criticise the Green New Deal for being too bold or being unmanageable. Ill tell you what I havent seen anything better that addresses the singular crisis we face a crisis that could at its worst lead to extinction he said. Literally the future of the world depends on us. Cruz held his Senate seat with a narrow win over ORourke last November. The Republican has dismissed climate change as a pseudoscientific theory and wrote an opinion article in 2017 urging Trump to rip up the landmark Paris climate agreement. ORourke meanwhile wrote a blog backing the Paris accord and during six years in Congress he successfully worked to secure federal protection for more than 7000 acres of mountainous land on the outskirts of his native El Paso. The League of Conservation Voters National Environmental Scorecard gives Cruz a lifetime rating of 4 based on his voting record in Congress ORourkes score is 95. Still ORourkes history on environmental issues is more complex than that number might suggest perhaps unsurprisingly for a politician who hails from west Texas. Texas has more installed wind power capacity than any other state and solar power is growing. But the states economy is heavily dependent on the fossil fuel industry which also wields immense political clout. ORourke received 476325 in campaign contributions from oil and gas sources in the 2017 18 election cycle according to the Center for Responsive Politics second nationally to Cruz albeit not from Pacs and a small percentage of his total donations. This helped fuel accusations that ORourke is more of a fossil fuel ally than his lofty rhetoric might imply. The Sludge an investigative website reported last December that ORourkes Senate campaign failed to comply with a pledge not to knowingly accept contributions of more than 200 from the oil and gas industry. ORourke has not yet signed up to the pledge for 2020. Already five declared presidential candidates have officially signed the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge meaning more than a third of declared Democratic candidates have done so said David Turnbull strategic communications director of Oil Change US a group that urges politicians to commit to clean energy. We look forward to the sixth candidate signing the full No Fossil Fuel Money pledge and were hopeful that Beto might be that candidate. ORourkes campaign did not respond to questions about whether he plans to sign the pledge or how his qualified support for natural gas is compatible with the Green New Deal. In 2015 ORourke twice voted to repeal the nationwide ban on exporting crude oil internationally arguing that lifting the prohibition would boost the economy and national security. We have seen the result which is an emergency of booming fossil fuel production here in the United States at precisely the time we need to be urgently moving away from those dirty fuels Turnbull said. Similarly problematic Beto has pointed to fracked natural gas as a potential part of the solution to the climate crisis when the reality is that there is simply no room for new fossil fuel development of any sort including fracked gas. Like with his support for the removal of the crude export ban we hope that when Beto lays out his full climate policies it will reflect the fact that we cant afford any new fossil fuels of any sort including gas. Given Texass critical importance to the environmental and economic future of the country a Texas presidential candidate can deliver a powerful green narrative said Luke Metzger executive director of Environment Texas an advocacy group. I think Texas has a real interesting story to tell in terms of our both being number one in the country for global warming pollution but also being number one for renewable energy he said. To be able to come from Texas and show we can reduce our pollution we can invest in clean energy I think thats a strong message.	True	False	False	True	False
Humans must drastically alter food production to prevent the most catastrophic effects of global warming according to a new report from the United Nations panel on climate change. The panel of scientists looked at the climate change effects of agriculture deforestation and other land use such as harvesting peat and managing grasslands and wetlands. Together those activities generate about a third of human greenhouse gas emissions including more than 40 of methane. That's important because methane is particularly good at trapping heat in the atmosphere. And the problem is getting more severe. Emissions from agricultural production are projected to increase the authors warn. Delaying action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions they continue could result in some irreversible impacts on some ecosystems. This is the latest in a series of reports from the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The new report adds weight and detail to a warning put out by the same panel of scientists last fall in which they sounded the alarm about the inadequacy of the pledges countries have made so far to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. At that time the panel broadly suggested that farmland would need to shrink and forests would need to grow to keep Earth from getting more than 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than it was in the preindustrial era. Global temperatures have already risen about 1 degree Celsius in the past 150 years. To meet that temperature target global greenhouse gas emissions will need to fall by 40 to 50 in the next decade. Scientists say the only way to achieve that reduction is to significantly increase the amount of land that's covered in trees and other vegetation and significantly reduce the amount of methane and other greenhouse gases that come from raising livestock such as cows sheep and goats. The new report offers some broad suggestions for how countries might achieve that. For example for countries that have lost tree cover in the past century reforestation can help suck greenhouse gases out of the air while also preventing soil from drying up. Reducing food waste can also help reduce a country's greenhouse gas footprint. Controlling emissions from agriculture is also a food security issue. Greenhouse gases from food production create a vicious cycle As Earth gets hotter farming gets more difficult in many places which forces farmers to clear more land to grow food. Climate change including increases in frequency and intensity of extremes has adversely impacted food security and terrestrial ecosystems as well as contributed to desertification and land degradation in many regions the report's authors write. If greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase as they are doing today it will exacerbate those challenges and eventually make it all but impossible to control global warming without creating serious food shortages. The U.N. panel is the latest group of experts to grapple with a global conundrum how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture deforestation and other land use without creating food shortages or displacing people whose livelihoods rely on practices that are unsustainable globally. Scientists and economists have been studying the effects of our diets on the environment for years. There's a growing consensus that a transition to a more plant centered diet would help. Currently about 50 of the globe's vegetated land is dedicated to agriculture and about 30 of cropland is used to grow grain for animal feed. Given how much land it takes to grow food to feed livestock meat production is a leading cause of deforestation. A report released last month by the World Resources Institute finds that if current dietary patterns continue an additional 593 million hectares which is almost twice the size of India would be needed to feed the projected 9.8 billion people the anticipated population by 2050. Right now agriculture generates an estimated 25 of annual greenhouse gas emissions according to the WRI that's when you combine food production and the land use changes associated with farming such as clearing vegetation and plowing. If current trends continue but agricultural productivity does not increase beyond 2010 levels the WRI report concludes that most of the globe's remaining forests would need to be cleared to feed the world. And the globe would exceed the greenhouse gas emission targets set by the Paris climate agreement.	True	False	False	True	False
Obviously if the temperature continues to go up at some point it can be harmful or even very harmful the billionaire Republican megadonor said during an interview last week on Freakonomics Radio. But the question is What do we do about it about whatever risk there is? And to me the answer is innovation. On the face of it that admission may seem like a shift coming from a man who with his brother David bankrolled a conservative movement bent on hacking away environmental regulations and helped transform the GOP into the only major political party in the developed world to deny the overwhelming evidence of manmade global warming. But to scientists Koch remains a climate pariah who has learned how to temper his message for audiences who dont buy into the view that industry players are somehow more credible than impartial researchers. Its just no longer credible to deny out of hand that climate change is happening or even that its human caused Michael Mann a climatologist at Penn State University and co author of a new book on climate change denialism told HuffPost on Monday. So the forces of denial the special interests the polluting interests have instead turned to a new talking point that they think they might be able to get away with. When you look at all the climate denial arguments theyre basically the flip of all that Its not real its not us its not bad the experts disagree or the experts are unreliable and theres no hope we cant fix it Cook told HuffPost. You expect them to be moving along that spectrum. But that reasoning which sounds measured compared to outright denial of observable phenomena has been employed for years to undermine climate science and does not represent an evolution on the issue. The spectrum of climate science denialism that argument included has not changed much over the past two decades according to a 2015 U.K. study analyzing 16000 documents from conservative think tanks. The philosophical belief that left alone the free market will produce industries and technologies to curb climate change before it becomes catastrophic is flawed. Economist Milton Friedman the so called patron saint of laissez faire capitalism who popularized the belief that corporations should pursue profit and shareholder value above all argued there is little incentive to preserve the environment without some form of government intervention. You need a price on the emission of carbon if youre going to level the playing field Mann said. Even Milton Friedman understood the existence of market externalities the fact that damage to our environment is not accounted for in the free market without placing some sort of price signal. The most popular solution among economists is putting a tax on carbon emissions. In February a group of Republican elder statesmen introduced a plan for a 40 carbon tax that would be returned to taxpayers in the form of a carbon dividend. A cadre of oil and gas giants including Exxon Mobil Corp. endorsed the proposal earlier this month. But the proposition faces dim prospects of becoming law under the Trump administration which has vowed to pump up the oil gas and coal industries. Booming U.S. oil production bolstered by advancements in hydraulic fracturing or fracking technology has helped keep oil prices low since they plummeted in mid 2014. The price per barrel now hovers just above 40. Without some incentive from policymakers to invest in zero emissions energy such as wind solar or hydropower the world is likely to warm well past 2 degrees Celsius or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. That temperature rise would drastically alter the climate submerge coastal communities and could create up to 2 billion refugees. Both government policy and low carbon technological innovations are going to be critical to keeping warming within 2C James Leaton research director at the U.K. based financial think tank Carbon Tracker told HuffPost by email. Obviously policy and technology interact and cannot be seen in isolation with policy stimulating technological deployment and rapid roll out reducing the future level of policy required. Both can impact the relative financial attractiveness of future energy options. These policies that the U.S. government has others have proposed or promulgated have been just symbolic Koch said in the interview. We oppose all of these because they end up being cronyism. They end up helping certain wealthy people to the disadvantage of the less fortunate. Sometimes the pot calls the kettle black. But in this case the kettle is filled with a solution to clean up the greasy mess left behind by the pot. And the pot is a fossil fuel tycoon with a net worth roughly the size of Bulgarias gross domestic product. Its one thing to be an ignorant fool but its quite something else to allow ones malicious ignorance to potentially threaten the entire planet Mann said. That is what is so pernicious about Kochs continued denial of the threat of climate change and the extent to which they have been able to pollute our entire political discourse by using their political wealth to confuse the public and policymakers about the reality of this existential threat.

Among the 2020 presidential candidates Cory Booker stands out for his record of advocating for the people who bear the brunt of pollution and toxic waste. Before his presidential run he traveled to Louisiana North Carolina and Alabama to inform a sweeping bill that codifies the federal governments requirement to incorporate the interests of communities of color in environmental regulation.And as the mayor of Newark Booker tackled the citys lead water crisis and industrial pollution. Booker is also one of the few presidential contenders to embrace nuclear energy openlyhis 3 trillion plan to address the climate crisis includes 20 billion in research and development of nuclear technology. This is one major difference between Booker and his opponent Bernie Sanders who has called nuclear power a false solution and actually phases it out in his climate plan. The candidate sat down with Climate Desk in Anacostia Washington D.C. for anexclusive interview a day before the climate strikes taking place around the world. As part of the wide ranging conversation about climate change he explainedhow he squares hissupport for nuclear power with his passion for cleaning up pollution in disadvantaged communities. I didnt come to the United States Senate as a big nuclear guy Booker told Grists executive editor Nikhil Swaminathan on Thursday but when I started looking at the urgency of climate change I saw that over 50 percent of our non carbon producing power right now comes from nuclear. Nuclear has to be a part of the blend Booker added. And to say its not to say youre going to get rid of nuclear really you are handicapping and undermining our ability to get to the ambitious goals we must have. Booker also supports a fee or tax on carbon pollution that would be used in part to fund clean energy and efficiency investments. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is also in favor of price on carbon and explained his plan toClimate Desk this week. I dont think theres any pathway to get to where we need to go without putting some kind of price on carbon he said. A lot of people say well gas is so cheap right now. Yeah its cheap because the price does not include the full cost to humanity. Bookers support for nuclear power and a carbon fee has tempered any praise from the Climate Justice Alliance a network that fears these policies would hurt more than help affected communities. Indeed critics of a carbon tax worry that it would be regressive hurting the poor more than the rich. But Booker argues that rebates and investments in poor communities could help solve that problem. And while historically nuclear power companies have built their plantsand dumped the wastein poor communities of color Booker believes it doesnt have to be that way He points to agreements struck between local and national governments in Canada and Europe as a model for a community process to deal with the waste. Nuclear has proven to be one of the safest ways to advance carbon neutrality he said. Even if it means that we have to phase off it in the future the real pressing challenge right now the threat to our health and our safety and our well being is climate change and that needs to be our driving focus.

Wildfires are raging through Californias wine country. Flooded homes in Houston Texas are still rotting. Puerto Ricans are languishing in darkness collecting drinking water from streams. And South Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands were still picking through the rubble as yet another hurricane made landfall over the mouth of the Mississippi River. Scientists say the frequency and severity of natural disasters like these are linked to climbing global temperatures. But the Trump administration on Tuesday announced plans to repeal the United States only major policy to combat climate change. The Clean Power Plan a set of Obama era regulations aimed at slashing emissions from coal fired power plants and boosting renewable energy production had yet to go into effect after being temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court since February 2016. On Tuesday afternoon Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt who sued to halt the plan last year when he was Oklahomas attorney general released a proposal to eliminate the policy without any replacement leaving the country without a national strategy to adapt to global warming. Rain soaked the state last winter stacking its mountains with colossal snowdrifts and quenching soil left parched after more than half a decade of historic drought. But record breaking heat baked the West in July and August drying its woodlands and leaving it vulnerable to the sort of blaze now engulfing the wine producing region neighboring San Francisco. These people have either no sense or a very sophisticated sense of irony to be doing this at this timehe added referring to the Trump administration. Following an exceptionally hot summer 172 fires 78 of which qualified as large incidents according to the National Interagency Fire Center burned more than 8 million acres in western Montana and the Pacific Northwest. Thats almost doublethe 10 year average of 5.5 million acres. Elsewhere a spate of fierce hurricanes inundated parts of the South and Caribbean. Warmer oceans tend to exacerbate storms and shift their directions. After Hurricane Harvey dumped 30 inches of rain on Houston in August scientists warned that the Category 4 storm served as a teachable example of the type of weather event their models predict will become more common as the planet continues to warm. The next few weeks proved Mother Nature to be a cruel instructor. Hurricane Irma rampaged through the Caribbean before slamming into Florida as a Category 5 beast knocking out power for millions and ultimately killing 69 people. Less than two weeks later Hurricane Maria pummeled Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands crippling the U.S. territories power grids and leaving whole areas uninhabitable. In Puerto Rico which has a larger population than 21 U.S. states the death toll continues to climb hitting 39 this week as the islands aging utility struggles to rebuild electrical transmission wires. But the proposal to scrap the policy without any kind of replacement to curb greenhouse gases underscores the extent to which the Trump administrations refusal to acknowledge basic climate science is leaving the country vulnerable to global warming effects that are no longer theoretical. It is crazy to think about having an EPA administrator who has nothing to offer in replacement of an admittedly not so good regulatory solution former Rep. Bob Inglis R S.C. now the executive director of the conservative environmental advocacy group RepublicEn told HuffPost by phone on Tuesday. To get rid of the Clean Power Plan without any idea of what to do that could be better is malfeasance on the part of the EPA administrator.	False	True	False	True	True
The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Changes IPCC newly released climate report once again found little to no evidence global warming caused many types of extreme weather events to increase. The IPCC once again reports that there is little basis for claiming that drought floods hurricanes tornadoes have increased much less increased due to greenhouse gases University of Colorado professor Roger Pielke Jr. tweetedSunday night. For example the IPCCs report noted that there is only low confidence regarding changes in global tropical cyclone numbers under global warming over the last four decades. Pielke pointed out this inconvenient data. Much like the IPCCs 2013 climate assessment the new special report confirmed what Pielke and others have said for years about the relationship between global warming and extreme weather. But dont expect to hear that from many other media outlets especially those that often cite individual weather events as evidence of man made warming. For example The Washington Posts write up of the IPCCs report focused on the mainline findings namely that the world is woefully off target to keep future global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The New York Times highlighted the IPCCs warning of a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires and a mass die off of coral reefs as soon as 2040. Neither WaPo nor NYT mentioned the reports findings on extreme weather. The IPCCs new report is meant to sound the alarm on global warming ahead of the UN climate summit which is to be held in Poland this December. Delegates are expected to make further commitments to implement the Paris climate accord that calls for limiting future warming below 2 degrees Celsius by 2100. Aside from dire predictions however the IPCCs new report also noted that many types of extreme weather events are not getting worse. RELATED Its The Final Chance We Have To Stop Global Warming Until The Next Chance When it comes to droughts for example the IPCC admits there is low confidence in the sign of drought trends since 1950 at global scale. The report says there are likely to be trends in some regions of the world including increasing droughts in the Mediterranean and decreasing droughts in parts of North America. The IPCC also noted there is low confidence due to limited evidence however that anthropogenic climate change has affected the frequency and the magnitude of floods. The report added that streamflow trends since 1950 are non statistically significant in most of the worlds largest rivers. However the reports authors warned that future warming could exacerbate extreme weather and hurt the global economy. The reports authors also claimed extreme weather had already increased contrary to much of their own evidence. One of the key messages that comes out very strongly from this report is that we are already seeing the consequences of 1 degree Celsius of global warming through more extreme weather rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice among other changes Panmao Zhai an IPCC co chair said in a statement issued Sunday.

The international summit Water and Climate Meeting of the Great Rivers of the World sponsored by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe UNECE and other partners is taking place in Romes Capitol building the Campidoglio from Oct. 23 25. In the Popes written message to the meeting conveyed by the Vaticans Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin the pontiff expressed his concern for water conservation around the world as well as his fervent desire that the threat posed by climate change to our brothers and sisters in the most vulnerable countries will find prompt and effective responses. In another speech at the summit Monday Mr. Karmenu Vella European Commissioner for Environment Maritime Affairs and Fisheries echoed the Popes concerns regarding climate change tying it into the situation of the worlds rivers. We are here today because our climate is under threat Mr. Vella said. Seasonal river flows are changing and floods and droughts are more severe more frequent than ever before. Climate change is raising the temperature of rivers and lakes with major impacts on ecosystems and water quality. These problems are just as real in Europe as they are elsewhere around the globe he asserted. The European Commissioner insisted that the key to addressing the problem of climate change and avoiding a point of no return is to be found in political will. The Paris Agreement reminds us of the need to prepare and adapt and to build up our climate resilience he said. In a major report last week the prestigious UK journal The Lancet suggested that pollution of air and water rather than carbon induced global warming is the real crisis facing the world one being overlooked by environmental activists. The Lancet revealed that pollution related diseases were responsible for an estimated 9 million premature deaths in 2015 or some 15 times more than from all wars and other forms of violence combined. Pollution is not only the largest environmental cause of disease and premature death in the world today the study found but diseases caused by pollution were responsible for roughly 16 percent of all deaths worldwidethree times more deaths than from AIDS tuberculosis and malaria combined and 15 times more than from all wars and other forms of violence. Curiously neither the European Commissioner nor the Pope made any mention to the extraordinary number of deaths caused by water and air pollution preferring instead to focus on the nebulous and ideologically charged notion of anthropogenic climate change. While to date there has not been a single documented case of a person being killed by carbon dioxide related global warming real pollution of air water and land is killing an average of 25000 people every day across the globe. Late last week a report out of Canada suggested that many nations around the world have quietly begun ignoring or abandoning the energy goals outlined by the Paris Climate Accord. According to Lawrence Solomon of Energy Probe a Toronto based environmental organization Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is one of the only signers of the Paris agreement who is actually abiding by the exacting demands of the accord. Solomon proposed that while feigning interest in global warming is politically expedient most people are unconvinced that it poses a real problemunlike the real pollution that is killing millions. In an essay in Fridays Financial Post Solomon said that most signatories are ignoring if not altogether abandoning Paris commitments undoubtedly because voters in large part put no stock in scary global warming scenarios. Trudeau now stands almost alone in sincere support of Paris Solomon wrote. The populist backlash a revulsion at top down governments laden with jet setting politicians landing in posh places to preach restraint to the masses has swept America with Trumps election Great Britain with Brexit much of Europe and Australia. In the process global warming enthusiasts are being swept out he said.	True	False	False	True	True
When Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull arrives in Washington this week for consultations with President Donald Trump he won't be traveling solo. Turnbull is bringing the most senior Australian political and business delegation ever to visit the United States in a trip aimed at building stronger relationships with America's governors. While he'll talk trade and security concerns with Mr. Trump Turnbull will spend the weekend courting U.S. governors at their annual gathering. Turnbull a Goldman Sachs executive turned prime minister is the latest world leader to extend outreach to U.S. governors and big city mayors in the age of Mr. Trump's America First policies. It's an end run or at least a shift in focus around Washington as foreign leaders react to Mr. Trump's unpredictability and occasional lack of interest in the sort of global cooperation they're seeking. Mr. Trump after all has announced plans to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord exit the Trans Pacific Partnership and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade deals. On certain issues like climate change these foreign leaders can't go to Washington anymore said Nicholas Burns a top State Department official during the Bush administration who also served as U.S. ambassador to NATO. This is happening more frequently because the Trump administration is pulling back on a number of its commitments. Turnbull isn't the only world leader to see the benefit of direct talks with American governors and municipal leaders. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's recent trip to the U.S. included trade and tourism talks in Illinois with Gov. Bruce Rauner and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel a stop in the San Francisco Bay area for meetings with California Gov. Jerry Brown and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and a visit to Los Angeles where he explored the city's hiking trails with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is planning an extensive U.S. tour in the coming weeks with expected stops in several U.S. cities. During last fall's U.N. climate talks in Bonn Germany Brown and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg took a starring role representing a group of U.S. states cities and businesses that argued they are still committed to curbing global warming even if Mr. Trump pulls out of the Paris accord. The group which calls itself America's Pledge notes that its collective alliance has an economy larger than Japan and Germany combined and can take steps to reduce emissions by promoting renewable energy use and climate friendly transportation systems. It's hardly unprecedented for heads of government and state to make stops outside Washington on visits to the U.S. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu frequently visits New York and Los Angeles and Mr. Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar a Lago club in Florida last year. But governors and mayors say there's been an uptick in the interest of foreign leaders in reaching out to them since Mr. Trump's election. It's political and it's practical. On the political side a lack of engagement strength and leadership from Washington and the White House Garcetti said in an interview. But the practical aspect is the world demands integration and work on these things. In Los Angeles Garcetti designated Nina Hachigian a former U.S. ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations during the Obama administration to serve in a new position of deputy mayor for international affairs. Hachigian oversees the city's international portfolio from the city's dozens of foreign consulates to trade climate and tourism issues and the city's hosting of the 2028 Olympic Games. Mr. Trump's election and the nontraditional makeup of his Cabinet and administration proved that the political leadership of America over the years is not going to come exclusively from Washington said Joe Hockey the Australian ambassador to the U.S. But these days relationships have to be deeper. They need to be more thoughtful. They need to be broader. And they need to be inclusive. Turnbull and Ghana President Nana Akufo Addo will address the National Governors Association this weekend and the prime minister is bringing most of Australia's territorial premiers who will attend a joint program with their American counterparts Saturday morning. The Australian government and the NGA have partnered to bring a joint group of CEOs to Washington this weekend as well. Certainly there's some change in policy at the national level with this administration creating a bit of change and foreign governments are wanting to interpret that said Scott Pattison the NGA's executive director and chief executive officer. He said it has resulted in an increased interest on the part of U.S. governors to forge direct ties with foreign officials. This really is about interaction economic development. There is no desire on the part of governors they know their role there's not a desire to get involved in foreign policy Pattison said. But local leaders and their foreign counterparts are finding new ways to make end runs around Washington particularly on economic development and environmental policy. Last week the NGA launched a new international cooperation arm called NGA Global designed to strengthen ties between governors and foreign governments. At the last NGA meeting held July in Rhode Island Trudeau became the first foreign leader to address the NGA in its history. Last year NGA brought governors to Germany and Switzerland to study how those countries used apprenticeships to better prepare their workforces a test run for the new office. NGA is also hosting a summit of North American governors and premiers in Phoenix in May a partnership they launched with their counterparts in Mexico and Canada in 2015.	True	False	False	True	True
Some of us knew this already. Butyou rarely hear itsotrenchantly expressed by a former world leader as it was in London yesterday by Aussie ex Prime Minister Tony Abbott in ahard hitting must read speech for the Global Warming Policy Foundation. Abbott is one of only a handful of world leaders to have spoken out against the global warming consensus. The only other ones recently are former Czech presidentVclav Klaus and of course President Donald Trump. This gives you an idea of just how badly infected are the nations of the free world by the green virus. Even those politicians who might nurture doubts in private almost never express them in public. Abbott himself lost his job as Australias prime minister at least in part because he was found guilty of wrongthink onclimate change which he once famously described as crap.The man who replaced him as prime minister Malcolm Turnbull unfondly known as the Honourable Member for Goldman Sachs is himself a leading tentacle of the Green Blob. Abbotts speech which is causing Australias notoriously left wing media to explode like ripe watermelons struck by hollow point bullets ought to serve as a painful reminder to Australias Liberal party of the talent they lost when they decided to knife this Jesuit trained Oxford educated rock solid family man conservative in the back and replace him with the slippery Davos style globalist Turnbull. Here are some of the highlights Climate change is a product of ignorance and an anti Christian society If science was all about consensus wed still be living in caves Greens want to make life nasty brutish and short Wheres the evidence for climate catastrophe? Theres none in Australia thats for sure Contrary to the breathless assertions that climate change is behind every weather event in Australia the floods are not bigger the bushfires are not worse the droughts are not deeper or longer and the cyclones are not more severe than they were in the 1800s. Sometimes they do more damage but thats because theres more to destroy not because their intensity has increased. More than 100 years of photography at Manly Beach in my electorate does not suggest that sea levels have risen despite frequent reports from climate alarmists that this is imminent. But theres plenty of evidence that green lunacy is killing the Australian economy Renewableshave more to do with virtue signalling than with useful energy Theres a reason renewable energy is crap and its so simple even lefties and greens should be able to understand it Hydro aside renewable energy should properly be referred to as intermittent and unreliable power. When the wind doesnt blow and the sun doesnt shine the power doesnt flow. Wind and solar power are like sailing ships cheaper than powered boats to be sure but weve stopped using sail for transport because it couldnt be trusted to turn up on time. Because the weather is unpredictable you never really know when renewable power is going to work. Its marginal cost is low but so is its reliability so in the absence of industrial scale batteries it always needs matching capacity from dependable coal gas hydro or nuclear energy. This should always have been obvious. We think wererational but where green policy is concerned were little better than the Aztecs Oh and by the way the way were carrying on Western Civilization is on its way out	False	True	False	True	False
Radioactive uranium has leaked through a three inch hole in the floor at a nuclear fuel factory in South Carolina contaminating the soil below the plant the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission says. According to the commission the hole goes six feet down into the soil below the Westinghouse factorys concrete floor. While the commission cannot yet say whether the toxic substance has leached into the areas groundwater agency records show that the soil beneath the plant contains 1300 times the amount of uranium typically found in soil. The commission learned of the leak on July 12 and still does not have results on recent groundwater tests which would show whether pollution had washed into the areas water supply. State Department of Health and Environmental Control officials said that the leak does not pose a threat to local water supplies but activists are concerned that Congaree National Park a vast wetland just several miles from the plant may be contaminated. Its a pretty big concern if you have an unknown quantity of material containing uranium leaching into the groundwaterlocal anti nuclear activist Tom Clements told The State. Exposure to uranium can cause kidney failure and can increase a persons risk of cancer. The Westinghouse fuel factory turns uranium into several types of fuel for nuclear reactors. Fuel manufactured at the South Carolina facility is used in nuclear reactors in the US Europe and Asia. Despite boasting that no company is more focused on nuclear fuel reliability Westinghouses South Carolina factory has seen its share of safety foul ups in the past. The plant was shut down two years ago following a uranium build up in an air pollution control device. Last year a hose malfunction sprayed a worker with a toxic solution sending him fleeing to an emergency decontamination shower. In both cases the company resolved to hire new management and overhaul its safety procedures. The factory has been operational for almost five decades and is one of a handful of nuclear fuel factories in the US. At present its federal operating license is up for renewal. The plant is still operating but the section where the hole was discovered has been shut down until repairs can be completed. Like this story? Share it with a friend!	True	False	False	True	True
Mark Wilson Getty Images Climate change protesters block traffic during a protest to shut down Washington D.C. on Sept. 23 2019. Activists demanding a greater global response to climate change disrupted Monday morning commutes with protests in Washington D.C. Ahead of the days United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York activists participated in Shut Down D.C. a coordinated act of civil disobedience designed to draw attention to the global climate crisis. A press release from the events organizers said that Mondays protesters included labor organizations the anti war group Code Pink Black Lives Matter and the environmental justice organization Rising Tide North America. Environmental activists gather in Washington on Monday during global climate action week. The organizers said their goal was to shut down the center of decision making in the U.S. to demand the government immediately ends fossil fuel production and enforces a swift and just transition to renewable energy. Among their demands were the passage of the Green New Deal additional measures to protect indigenous peoples land and a broad push toward climate justice. Pictures and videos posted to social media on Monday morning showed protesters halting traffic at a number of Washington intersections. D.C. police identified 14 locations that were blocked at some point according to The Washington Post.

Democratic US presidential candidate Joe Biden whose first campaign was sunk by plagiarism has been caught plagiarizing bits of his 2020 climate plan. The campaign claims it merely left out the citations. At least three passages from the climate plan Biden's campaign released on Tuesday were copied directly from environmental organizations CREDO activist Josh Nelson tweeted posting original text from the Carbon Capture Coalition and the Blue Green Alliance alongside text from Biden's campaign website. Compounding the gaffe the Carbon Capture Coalition's membership includes the country's largest fossil fuel companies not such strange bedfellows for Biden who received a D grade from Greenpeace last week largely due to his lack of environmental policy but less than ideal for a candidate trying to reinvent himself as green. Biden's campaign waited the better part of a day to address the charges as the news spread buoyed by anger at the candidate over news he'd lied about marching in the civil rights movement finally telling Business Insider that while they had inadvertently left out several citations from the final version of the document posted to the website it had been updated to include references. Biden's habit of plagiarism dates back to his first presidential campaign in 1988 when he lifted a popular speech from a UK politician that mischaracterized his own family background implyinghe was descended from coal miners and the first in his family to attend university. Caught in a pile of lies the campaign responded with a strikingly similar excuse To the degree it wasn't attributed it was an oversight or inadvertent Biden's 1988 campaign aide told the New York Times. It wasn't the only misappropriated speech Biden made before dropping out of the race he also borrowed one from Robert F. Kennedy the previous year and even plagiarized while at law school complaining when he was caught that his intent was not to deceive anyone. The candidate complained the fuss over his plagiarism was much ado about nothing and blamed rival campaigns for blowing the issue out of proportion. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

While scientists continue to warn that climate change poses an existential threat to the planet President Trump wont be talking about it at next years G 7 summit at one of his Florida golf resorts. Climate change will not be on the agenda acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters gathered in the White House briefing room Thursday without elaborating. Mulvaney announced that the G 7 meetings would be held on June 10 and 11 at the Trump National Doral Golf Club just west of Miami an area threatened by sea level rise brought on by climate change. With its low elevations and porous limestone bedrock South Florida is particularly vulnerable to sea level rise. Despite warnings from the scientific community developers including Trump have continued to invest in property that could be underwater before long. Just using the U.S. government projections we could be at 11 to over 13 feet of sea level rise by the end of century Harold Wanless director of the University of Miamis geological sciences department and a leading expert on sea level rise told Yahoo News. Theres only 3 percent of Miami Dade County thats greater than 12 feet above sea level. Trump has labeled climate change a hoax concocted by the Chinese government in an attempt to ruin the U.S. economy but not all members of the Republican Party agree. For the first time in a decade Floridas state Senate held a meeting this week to discuss the impacts of climate change the Miami Herald reported. Theres a younger generation of conservatives in this state that arent as much in denial Republican Sen. Tom Lee who chairs the Committee on Infrastructure and Security told the Herald. Young climate activists like Swedens Greta Thunberg have mobilized students around the world to hold school strikes to protest inaction from world leaders on what they see as a crisis. Something must have changed in the debate that so many young people are speaking up and so many young people are being targeted Thunberg told Yahoo News in response to the mockery her movement has received from leaders like Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. They can sense that we are making an impact. They obviously dont want that. So they are using several methods to mock and hate. While Trump continues to deny the threat that climate change poses to his own properties and the world at large the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco released a report Thursday on the financial risks that global warming poses. It found that properties like Doral that are likely to be underwater in the coming years are already selling for 15 percent less than those where flooding is not a threat. Even more jarring the report warned that climate change poses a threat to the availability of the 30 year mortgage in various vulnerable and highly exposed areas. Thanks to the continued buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due primarily to the use of fossil fuels the rate at which the polar icecaps are melting continues to exceed previous estimates. As of Aug. 1 of this year for instance Greenland had lost a record 12.5 billion tons of ice. This year is on pace to become the second warmest on record and all of the top 10 hottest years on record with the exception of 1998 have occurred since 2005.

In a video posted to social media on Monday New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio again directly blamed climate change for 2012's deadySuperstormSandy a contention that lacks scientific support and touted his plan to spend 10billionto fortify and protectLower Manhattan against future storms. Even as local leaders warned that de Blasio's plan to construct new barriers would actually destroy the waterfront neighborhoods he says he wants to protect de Blasio insisted his views were now mainstream among New Yorkers. After Sandy there weren't a lot of climate change deniers left in New York City de Blasio said directly into the camera after reminding viewers that the stormleft dozens dead and cost the city billions in economic losses.We need to protect this city and this country and this world from global warming. There's no national policy to do it right now. ... We have to do it ourselves. Mayor de Blasio added in the video which appeared on Facebook and Twitter that the federal government also must act quickly We have to fight for the bigger changes like the Green New Deal de Blasio said. The mayor claimed that studiesundertaken by his office and others has determined that if the city does not prepare for climate change rising seas will expose 20 percent of lower Manhattan to daily flooding by 2100. However past expert predictions on the effects of global warming have proven inaccurate at best. For exampleUnited Nations scientists predicted that the world had only 10 years to immediately address climate change all the way back in 1989 in order to protect entire cities from destruction and a resulting flood ofeco refugees. ANASA scientist falsely predicted the same thing in 2006. Contrary to de Blasio's assertions no study has defintively linked the existence or power of Superstorm Sandy to man made climate change or made the claim that such a link can be definitively established at all.Some contested studies have however suggested the storm may have become more intense to some degree as a result of warming sea temperatures. We suggest that it is more useful to regard the extreme circulation regime or weather event as being largely unaffected by climate change and question whether known changes in the climate system's thermodynamic state affected the impact of the particular event stated one paper produced by researchers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The researchers added Some examples briefly illustrated include 'snowmaggedon' in February 2010 Superstorm Sandy in October 2012 and supertyphoon Haiyan in November 2013 and in more detail the Boulder floods of September 2013 all of which were influenced by high sea surface temperatures that had a discernible human component. The Green New Deal backed by de Blasio has not attracted universal support even among Democrats after the resolution'sbotched rollout in Congress earlier this year included the release of an official document by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez's officethat promisedeconomic security even for thoseunwilling to workas well as the elimination offarting cows and air travel. The Democratic mayor on Thursday first announcedhis planto meet the existential threat of climate change specifically by extending a section of the lower Manhattan coastline as much as 500 feet into the East River. He said the 10 billion effort to protect lower Manhattan from flooding by extending the shoreline between the Brooklyn Bridge and the Battery will be funded partly by private development if federal funds are not available. WHAT DOES TRUMP ADMIN'S OWN CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT SAY IS COMING? If there's federal money in play it probably looks one way de Blasio said last week.If there's not federal money in play we have to get some private money into it and there has to be some development. Officials have been developing schemes to fortify New York City's waterfront since Superstorm Sandy destroyed thousands of homes and businesses in 2012. De Blasio said it will cost about 500 million to fortify most of lower Manhattan from future effects of climate change including rising sea levels and intense precipitation with grassy berms and removable barriers. But planners determined that protecting the lowest lying area including South Street Seaport and the financial district will require adding more land over several years. De Blasio who is contemplating joining the crowded field of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates said the 10 billion landfill project should be supported by federal funds but that's unlikely to happen during the administration of Republican President Donald Trump. Lower Manhattan is one of the core centers of the American economy he said. It's where the financial capital of the United States is. The security of lower Manhattan should be a national priority. The fact is it is not. And it's incomprehensible to me that there's no sense of urgency from the federal government. He added We can't afford to bury our head in the sand and that's right now what our federal government is doing. The plan to extend the coastline will go through the city's environmental review process de Blasio said but he hopes to avoid the endless dragging on that usually accompanies something of this scale. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But the prospect of private development on the newly built land is sure to meet resistance from downtown Manhattan community members. City Council member Margaret Chin who represents the area said amore resilient future cannot be paid for by private real estate development that would destroy the waterfront neighborhoods that we are trying to protect. De Blasio announced the climate resilience plan at a news conference after previewing it inNew York magazine. This is the existential threat de Blasio said. This is the core issue we all must face as aggressively as humanly possible. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	False	False	True	True	True
After this hurricane season the GOP has a dose of reality they are going to HAVE to take climate change is real and it can and will be destructive. With what basically amounts to a humanitarian crisis going on in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria it cannot be ignored any longer. However with a Trump administration it will be if allowed. Fortunately for the country and the world there are some Democrats who will do their best to stop the Republican party from destroying the Earth with their own blatant ignorance. During a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing on Wednesday Senator Jeff Merkley D OR took EPA appointee William Wehrum to task over his inability to acknowledge that greenhouse gases do have a major impact on temperature. Merkley displayed a chart composed by NASA that showed the relationship between rising temperatures and rising greenhouse emissions. Obviously the chart showed that as greenhouse gas emissions go up so does the temperature. It was a basic question asking if the lines followed each other. A five year old could easily note that they do indeed follow each other. Wehrum tried to sleazily worm his way out of answering the simple question. Merkley interrupted Wehrum and asked him to just look at the lines. Wehrum never did answer the question. Merkley thanked him and then let him have it. He then noted NASA found no correlation between solar activity or volcanic activity however they did find a correlation between carbon dioxide and other global warming gases and the rising temperature of the planet. Merkley continued For the rest of the questioning Merkley continued to show just how woefully ignorant the officials in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency are. The truly maddening part though is that Merkley showed the American people that its not just ignorance its intentional ignorance. They refuse to see it accept being ignorant and continue their refusal to acknowledge that climate change is real and it will have and already has had devastating effects on the planet. You can watch a video of the hearing below.	True	True	True	True	False
In a statement to HuffPost the campaign said it plans to fund renewable energy projects to compensate for the carbon dioxide spewed by the planes and automobiles in which Sanders and his staff will travel while they barnstorm the nation ahead of the Democratic National Convention in July 2020. Bernie Sanders is a champion in the fight for climate justice and like him we know we need to address our emissions through action not just rhetoric Faiz Shakir Sanders campaign manager said in a statement. We are proud to lead the way in the fight against climate change by acting boldly to move our energy system away from fossil fuels and towards sustainable energy sources. Climate change is already a central plank of Sanders second White House bid.In December two months before he announced his candidacy the senator from Vermonthosted a televised town hall with climate scientists and advocates to discuss the crisis. In February he attacked Trump for ignoring climate change in his State of the Union address. During his stump speeches Sanders routinely skewers the fossil fuel industry and promises to enact a Green New Deal if elected. The announcement boosts Sanders bona fides on the issue and gives him a leg up in a crowded field of Democrats putting more attention on climate change than ever before. The move comes a week after the Sanders campaign became the first to unionize. Sanders has also drawn heat recently for his uncertain stance on reparations for the descendants of slaves and for quietly hiring a journalist who frequently attacked his 2020 opponents on Twitter as an adviser. Carbon offsets represent a drop in the bucket on an issue that requires unprecedented systemic change to avert climate disaster. But transportation emissions make up the largest share of the United States climate pollution.Sanders announcement steels the campaign against accusations of hypocrisy often made by Republicans who take an ideological stance against the scientific realities of climate change. The Sanders campaign is buying carbon offsets from Vermont based NativeEnergy the same company Clinton used three years ago. Once dubbedthe celebrities choice in offset providers NativeEnergy provides third party verification of how its offsets are used and boasts a high score as a benefit corporation a sort of LEED certification of for profit companies that pay employees decent wages and provide measurable value to society. Though founded and run by a former utility lawyer the company as its name suggests transferred a majority stake in its ownership to a consortium of Native American tribes in 2005. Carbon emissions from campaign travel first became an issue during the 2004 election when the NRDC Action Fund an affiliate of the Natural Resources Defense Council began raising concerns about the huge amount of fuel candidates burned crisscrossing the country. In 2007 former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack became the first presidential contender to go carbon neutral. John Edwards followed soon after. By 2008 both Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain rushed to put themselves on a carbon diet according to MSNBC. During the 2016 Democratic primary Sanders clashed with Clinton over climate change attacking her support for increased gas drilling in a heated debate. After Clinton clinched the nomination the issue disappeared without a single question asked during three debates between Clinton and her Republican opponent Donald Trump. We are proud to lead the way in the fight against climate change by acting boldly to move our energy system away from fossil fuels and towards sustainable energy sources. Nearly every major declared contender for the Democratic nomination has expressed support for the Green New Deal a movement calling for a sweeping national industrial policy that zeroes out greenhouse gases over a decade guarantees clean energy jobs to millions and puts the country on course to generate as close to 100 percent of its electricity from renewables as possible in a decade. In a first Washington Gov. Jay Inslee is centering his entire campaign on climate change vowing to make it his priority if nominated. He joined Sanders Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand D N.Y. Sen. Elizabeth Warren D Mass. and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard D Hawaii in signing the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge an oath promising to reject donations from the oil gas and coal companies and their executives. The newfound attention on climate change comes after the United Nations stark warning in October that world governments have roughly a decade to halve global emissions or face an average temperature increase of at least 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit about half a degree Celisus more than what the world experiences today. Warming beyond that level is forecast to cause catastrophic flooding droughts and extreme weather with economic damages topping 54 trillion.	True	False	False	True	True
While a sobering new UN report on climate change indicates humans might have little time to change our ways to avoid environmental catastrophe President Trump isnt worried pointing to scientists on both sides of the picture. Referencing an uncle who was a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology whom he never spoke to about climate change as apparent proof of his scientific bona fides Trump told the Associated Press that he has a natural instinct for science and that the climate goes back and forth back and forth. The US president remains unconvinced that human activity is the cause of climate change. While he has backed away from a 2012 claim that the concept was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing noncompetitive he is now convinced that somethings changing and itll change back again according to aninterviewhe gave with 60 Minutes on Sunday. Trumps appointee to the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt notoriously attempted to roll back several key environmental regulations passed under Barack Obama including the Clean Power Plan the Clean Water Rule and a proposed ban on the pesticide chlorpyrifos. Pruitt also oversaw a 23 percent budget cut to the agency and filled science advisory panels with industry representatives instead of unaffiliated scientists. Trump may believe in climate change now but he remains convinced that scientists who see a human role in the process have a very big political agenda. Meanwhile he doesnt want to sacrifice the economic well being of our country for something that nobody really knows. While some Democrats favor bold moves to address climate change others perhaps still shell shocked by the failure of their 2009 cap and trade bill under Obama shy away from anything more than incremental measures citing the hostile political environment in Congress. Rep. Gerry Connolly D VA said Democrats should focus on the practical and the opportunistic in the short term while working toward big picture aspirational goals in the long term. Some might argue the concept of a long term when it comes to the environment was rendered irrelevant by the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. It projected that humans have until 2030 to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions if we want to avoid catastrophic climate change in the form of massive sea level rise increased drought permafrost melt and coral reef die offs.

When it comes to unraveling liberal hypocrisy Fox News host Tucker Carlson is arguably the best man for the job. And on his show Friday it took Carlson just 90 seconds to completely dismantle liberal outrage over President Donald Trumps decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change. Progressives across the country and around the world expressed outrage this week over Trumps decision to withdraw from the agreement. But many of those expressing outrage including world famous Hollywood actors and businessmen typically fly around the world in private jets that expel mind boggling amounts of carbon dioxide the exact substance climate alarmists say is the cause of climate change. Carlson explained on his show Friday that despite the fact that those upset about Trumps decision have not bothered to explain whats actually in the Paris agreement they assure us that that deal is the solution to the single most gravest threat this planet has ever faced rising levels of atmospheric CO2. Theyre dead serious about that. You can tell by the outraged looks on their faces and the purple rhetoric Carlson said. But hold on for a minute. Can we really be sure that these people take carbon emissions seriously? To answer that question Carlson said his team compared what the progressives say to how they live. They examined the lives of billionaire businessmen Richard Branson Elon Musk and Bill Gates in addition to Hollywood superstar Leonardo DiCaprio and Hillary Clinton. Branson says fossil fuels are dangerous and he calls Trumps decision America first Earth last. Now on the other hand Branson owes a Desault Falcon 50EX private jet and it burns more fuel on a single flight to Maui than youre gonna go through in a lifetime of trips to the shore Carlson explained. Elon Musk meanwhile is mad about global warming too. Yet he flies around in a Gulfstream G6500ER. Bill Gates says hes deeply concerned yet he still commutes in a 62 million bombardier BD700 global express. Can you imagine the gas milage that gets? Carlson continued. Leonardo DiCaprio says Trumps move threatens the livability of our planet and yet DiCaprio flew a private jet 4000 miles from Cannes France to New York to accept a climate award and then flew back privately Carlson went on to explain. Hillary Clinton tweeted that Trumps pullout was a historic mistake that leaves American workers and families behind. And yet speaking of workers and their families there probably werent a lot of those onboard last year when Hillary used a private jet to fly 20 miles from Marthas Vineyard to Nantucket for a fundraiser Carlson added. Trump announced his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the climate deal which was agreed to under former President Barack Obama on Thursday.	True	True	False	True	True
An Environmental Protection Agency website teaching kids about acid rain instructs children using cartoon animals to avoid cars limit air conditioning and to buy cars that dont make the air as dirty. The EPAs Acid Rain Kids Site features the story of Lucy Lake a lake living in the mountains and the sick animals around her. On a normal day the plants and animals at Lucy Lake have enough food and clean water to keep them healthy reads the EPA site. The wind carries pure air and the rain comes down clear and clean. But lately Lucy Lake and her friends have not been feeling very well reads the story. Kids then see a cartoon depiction of a browned sweating sick tree a frowning lake and a fish that appears to be gasping for air accompanied by the following text All the plants and animals of the forest gather together to talk about the problem. Why are we sick? asks Frannie Frog. What is doing this to us? asks Sammy Spruce. What can we do? asks Lucy Lake. No one has any answers. Thankfully two people on a hike walk by. A cartoon frog stops the hikers to tell them about the dangers of acid rain. The creatures of the forest gather around and tell the hikers about their problems. We are hungry Were tired and weak Our babies are sick the plants and animals complain. Can you help us? they all ask. The hikers both nod their heads. Yes one hiker says. I think I know what the problem is he says. Its acid rain. One of the hikers then explains where acid rain comes from citing the danger of pollution caused by power plants. Acid rain comes from chemicals in the air or pollution says the hiker in the story. A lot of this pollution comes from power plants that burn fossil fuels like coal to make electricity. We use this electricity to make our lights and our TVs work. Pollution also comes from the cars and trucks people drive. This pollution also causes acid rain. With the help of the plants and animals the hikers then make a list of things that will stop the acid rain from killing the cute cartoon creatures. The list includes turning the lights off when leaving a room not using air conditioning as much riding buses and trains to avoid cars and buying vehicles that dont make the air as dirty. The story ends unsurprisingly with the hikers saving the forest and all its creatures including Sammy Spruce Wendy Wind and a gigantic smiling raindrop. The EPA website contains an Acid Rain Activity Book that includes several acid rain themed games for kids. It also includes a Message for Adults Acid rain is a problem that affects us all The message to spread however is that we can all make a difference and help reduce the presence of acid rain. We hope this Web site will provide younger children with basic information about acid rain and help them form a foundation of knowledge about and an interest for a variety of environmental issues. Its unclear whether acid rain is still a noteworthy problem. Some environmentalists claim it is but others including the Environmental Defense Fund a left wing organization calling for cap and trade policies to battle climate change says problems related to acid rain pollution have been largely been solved.

The much maligned rat is not a creature many would associate with coral reefs. But scientists studying reefs on tropical islands say the animals directly threaten the survival of these ecosystems. A team working on the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean found that invasive rats on the islands are a big problem for coral reefs. Rats decimate seabird populations in turn decimating the volume of bird droppings a natural coral fertiliser. The findings are published in Nature. Scientists now advocate eradicating rats from all of the islands to protect these delicate marine habitats. The Chagos Archipelago provided a large scale natural laboratory to answer this question although the islands are uninhabited by humans some of them are now home to invasive rats brought by ships and shipwrecks. Other islands have remained rat free. The islands with and without rats are like chalk and cheese said Prof Nick Graham from Lancaster University. The islands with no rats are full of birds they're noisy the sky is full and they smell because the guano the birds are depositing back on the island is very pungent. If you step onto an island with rats there's next to no seabirds. By killing seabirds this study revealed rats disrupt a healthy ecosystem that depends on the seabird droppings which fertilise the reefs surrounding the island. On rat free islands seabirds including boobies frigatebirds noddies shearwaters and terns travel hundreds of kilometres to feed out in the ocean. When they return to the island they deposit rich nutrients from the fish they feed on. These nutrients are leaching out onto the reef explained Prof Graham. He and his team were able to track the source of those nutrients back to the fish that seabirds fed on by analysing algae and sponges growing on the reef. We also found that fish on the reefs adjacent to islands with seabirds were growing faster and were larger for their age than the fish on reefs next to rat infested islands Prof Graham explained. There were also significantly more fish on rat free reefs than on those around ratty islands. Coral reefs cover less than 0.1 of the ocean's area but house about one third of ocean biodiversity. Coral reefs are also hugely threatened said Prof Graham. So anyone who cares about extinctions and biodiversity needs to care about the future of coral reefs. The reefs and their abundance of marine life provide livelihoods for millions of people around the world so the decline in coral reefs is poised to become a humanitarian crisis. This team of researchers advocates rat eradication projects on islands throughout the world. Coral reef systems are at crisis point because of climate change said Prof Graham. And we're desperately trying to find ways to enhance the resilience of coral reefs and allow them to cope with climate change. This is one of the clearest examples so far where eradicating rats will lead to increased numbers of seabirds and this will bolster the coral reef.	True	False	False	True	False
A mega blaze raging across a 60km 37 mile front north of the Australian city of Sydney cannot currently be put out fire officials have warned. The blaze across 300000 hectares 1150 sq m is just an hour's drive from the nation's most populous city. People who cannot defend their property from approaching fires have been told they should leave immediately. Since October bushfires have killed six people and destroyed more than 700 homes across Australia. The severity of the blazes so early in the fire season has caused alarm and prompted calls for greater action to tackle climate change. How are animals faring in the fires? Fires have also raged across Queensland Victoria South Australia Western Australia and Tasmania. What's the latest on the ground? Several fires have combined to form the mega blaze north of Sydney although more than a dozen locations are affected across New South Wales. At one point on Friday nine fires had been raised to emergency level warnings although these had decreased markedly amid a brief respite in conditions later in the day. The north Sydney blazes were sending black fumes across the city causing a rise in medical problems. New South Wales Rural Fire Service RFS deputy commissioner Rob Rogers told ABC We cannot stop these fires they will just keep burning until conditions ease and then we'll try to do what we can to contain them. He said the 60km stretch from Hawkesbury to Singleton was just fire that whole way. The RFS website listed five fires roughly in a line from Nullo Mountain to Wollombi as out of control at 0500 local time on Saturday 1800 GMT Friday with another out of control at Green Wattle Creek south west of Sydney. Video footage from the Orangeville area showed firefighters running from a wall of fire and the Walkabout Wildlife Park has evacuated hundreds of animals. The Bureau of Meteorology BOM also said that some fires were too big to put out. Fire officials in Ingleburn warned If your property is not prepared for the bushfire season and you're not sure you are able or capable of defending your property if a fire approaches you need to leave straight away. Firefighters from Canada were briefed in Sydney on Friday and will be deployed across New South Wales over the weekend to be joined by teams from the US. There appears to be little respite. RFS founder and former commissioner Phil Koperberg told the Sydney Morning Herald People are nervous and they have a right to be... the worst is yet to come. Tuesday is the next big concern with temperatures inland of Sydney likely to reach 40C plus. Some firefighters have expressed concern that volunteer numbers might not be enough and that there are inadequate water supplies. One said the fires were all ticking time bombs without rain those fires won't be put out. Sydney may be blanketed in smoke for weeks if not months RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said. Is this fire season particularly bad? It hasn't come close to the fatalities of 2009 when nearly 200 people died but the scale of the damage has been huge. How bad is bushfire smoke for health? More than 1.6 million hectares of land have burned in New South Wales alone. The season has hit earlier than normal and has been exacerbated by drought conditions. Mr Fitzsimmons said There is an absolute lack of moisture in the soil a lack of moisture in the vegetation... you are seeing fires started very easily and they are spreading extremely quickly and they are burning ridiculously intensely. The BOM says that climate change has led to an increase in extreme heat events and raised the severity of other natural disasters such as drought. Last week the bureau noted that NSW had endured its driest spring season on record. It also warned that Australia's coming summer was predicted to bring similar conditions to last year's the nation's hottest summer on record. Australia may see 50C days 'in decades' The government has been criticised over its efforts to address climate change. PM Scott Morrison has dismissed accusations linking the crisis to his government's policies. What could be wiped out by temperature rise Hundreds of bushfire survivors and farmers converged on the nation's capital Canberra this week in protest. One woman displayed the charred remains of her home outside Parliament on which she had written Morrison your climate crisis destroyed my home.	False	False	False	True	True
TANGIER ISLAND Va. Reuters This summer a delegation of Republican climate activists visited Tangier Island a speck of grassland in Virginia's Chesapeake Bay to try to convince its 450 residents to take climate change seriously. At a dinner attended by island residents Aug. 2 the activists from RepublicEn headed by former Republican Congressman Bob Inglis laid out the stakes The sea level is rising and some scientists estimate that within decades the island already suffering severe erosion will need to be abandoned. The people of Tangier Island were used to this kind of message. Former Vice President Al Gore a prominent Democratic climate activist had given the same speech to islanders three days earlier. They were also used to rejecting it. We'll talk to everybody said James Eskridge mayor of the mainly Republican island community. But they're not going to change many minds here. Residents he said do not believe in climate change they want a new sea wall to prevent erosion not a lecture about saving the world with solar panels. Tangier Island's steadfast rejection of climate change reflects the rigidity of American opinions about global warming often defined along political party lines. ReutersIpsos polling shows more than a third of Americans mainly Republicans reject the scientific consensus that climate change is driven by human activity. Less than a third of Americans believe global warming poses an imminent threat to the United States. These views barely budged after a series of devastating hurricanes this summer. That rift in opinion has proven to be a headwind for U.S. lawmakers seeking broad solutions to stem climate change like imposing a cost on carbon emissions or encouraging cleaner renewable energy technologies to replace fossil fuels. And while conservatives have long been skeptical about climate change doubters have a powerful new ally U.S. President Donald Trump. He has called climate change a hoax and has started withdrawing the United States from a global pact to combat it citing what he calls the huge economic cost. Eskridge told Reuters Trump called him in June after seeing a report about severe erosion problems on the island telling him not to worry about sea level rise. I believe man plays a part in it but not to the extent that others have been talking about that's what me and Donald Trump were talking about Eskridge said. 'WE'RE LOOKING TO STAY' An Army Corps of Engineers study in 2015 showed Tangier has lost two thirds of its mass since 1850 because of erosion a process scientists say is being exacerbated by climate change. Journalists and politicians now view the island as a symbol of the climate crisis. Tangier residents are happy with the attention but believe their problem is simpler. A sea wall built on one side of the island in the late 1980s has prevented the land behind it from eroding they say so another sea wall is the answer. We're not looking to have our light bills cheaper we're looking to stay here said Deborah Pruitt 57 who works at the island's museum where printouts of news reports about the island are displayed on a wall. Conservative climate activists like Rob Sisson of ConservAmerica and Mitch Hescox of the Evangelical Environmental Network said the rejection of climate change by Tangier residents is not surprising their groups often have trouble convincing fellow Republicans global warming is a real issue. Often they say people object to the idea that humans could possibly change the climate even if they wanted to. Florida Congresswoman Ileana Ros Lehtinen one of a handful of Republicans to publicly declare a belief in climate change said she has a strategy for getting fellow Republicans to think of solutionsI've found that the best way ... is to not dwell on the causes she said in an email.

GUILLERMO ARIAS via Getty Images A child in the caravan of roughly 7200 Central American migrants headed north to the U.S. Mexico border. Now with the White House poised to gut the federal governments only two major rules to reduce planet warming emissions and Trumpthreatening to cut aid to drought and violence afflicted Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador critics say the administrations strategy to deal with climate change is taking shape frustrating national security experts who say hunkering down and militarizing borders will do little to mitigate global warmings threats. A quasi fascist policy of fear mongering about immigration and corresponding militarization of the border is clearly the major thrust of Trumps response to the mounting impacts of climate chaos said Ashley Dawson author ofExtreme Cities The Peril and Promise of Urban Life in the Age of Climate Change. Despite the repeated dismissals of climate science by the president and many of his top advisers the Trump administration officially forecasts that the planet is expected to warm by 7 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century a projection buried in a 500 page environmental impact statement in August. Thats roughly double the temperature scientists say will cause cataclysmic drought storms and sea level rise and roughly four times the warming the planet has already experienced since the pre industrial era. Under those conditions more than 1 billion people globally could be forced to flee their homes by 2050 and2 billion by 2100. Tropical regions where many of the roughly20000 to 40000 migrants who crossed the U.S. southern border each month in the past year came from are expected to be hit the hardest. Its difficult to draw a direct line between climate change and a migrants decision to leave home and neither the United Nations nor nearly any other major countries currently offer legal avenues for asylum seekers fleeing the effects of global warming. New Zealandbecame the first country late last year to create a special status for climate refugees with 100 annual visas as low lying island nations in its corner of the Pacific face existential threat of sea level rise. On the opposite side of the ocean a hotter climate is expected to parch once fertile lands. In an email Jennifer Francis a Rutgers University climate researcher said its likely that increasing drought in Central America is making it more difficult for farmers there to make a living. The President had willing partners in Congress and could have worked on immigration border security DREAMers and all that Joseph Majkut director of climate policy at the Niskanen Center a libertarian think tank said in an email. But he didnt take advantage of that opportunity. Having missed the chance to seek actual reforms we now get a militaristic and hasty response to a predictable stress. Climate change is contributing to make nations unstable both nations in our neighborhood and others abroad said Femia whose Washington based policy institute includes former top national security advisers. The best way from a security perspective is to bolster the resilience of those countries so you reduce the likelihood of instability reduce the likelihood of conflict and reduce the likelihood of displacement that might force outward migration. That doesnt seem likely in the near term. The president attempted to cut funding forUnited States Agency for International Development by 33 percent this year though bipartisan support for the federal governments dedicated aid agency staved off the proposal. By deporting hundreds of thousands of Central Americans from the United States the administration like the Obama administration before it is bolstering gang recruitment in countries like El Salvador according to a December report from the International Crisis Group. That worsens the violence that many cite as a main reason for fleeing northward.	False	True	False	False	False
Thousands of European activists plan to blockade a large German lignite mine this week the latest protest of a growing climate civil disobedience movement. While school students have held Fridays for Future rallies for months protesters of the Extinction Rebellion group launched in Britain have risked arrest with more confrontational protests. From next Thursday to Monday Europe's veteran Ende Gelaende EG anti coal activists will hold their sixth large scale blockade of an open pit coal mine and power plants run by German energy giant RWE. The group's online action consensus says In view of the urgency of the climate crisis we consider it necessary and appropriate to go one step further from public protest to civil disobedience. Here is a look at this growing form of environmental activism. Tadzio Mueller a German organiser of the movement argues that massively breaking the rules ... is the only thing that works to prevent the status quo in the face of climate chaos. Azna Lecuyer of the French branch of Ende Gelaende agrees that we feel a passion for actions of civil disobedience especially among young people. This is reflected in demand for training courses everywhere and by the very rapid rise in skills of new activists. Lecuyer stresses that non violence is part of our action consensus it is forbidden to harm the security forces site employees or to damage the equipment. During past protests at the nearby Hambacher Forest police and RWE company staff have accused the most militant protesters of having hurled rocks or molotov cocktails. The Ende Gelaende movement has distanced itself from those environmental militants and any acts of violence. The EG activistsdressed in trademark white overalls symbolising the toxicity of fossil fuelsplan to march from their protest camp to the Garzweiler mine about 10 kilometres six miles away. They hope to evade police roadblocks and enter the vast open pit mining area to occupy strategic locations and technical infrastructure such as rails access roads and excavators. Meanwhile they plan to organise in so called affinity groups of up to 10 people of similar physical fitnessand a willingness to be arrested for trespassing and other offences. Before the protest activists attend training workshops to learn non violent resistance techniques such as locking their arms and legs in formation with names such as the little train or the turtle. What risks do protesters take? Occupying an industrial site is illegal under German law and volunteer legal advisers are on hand to support activists before and after they are arrested. They advise them to say as little as possible while in custody. Other risks lurk at the Garzweiler site. A vast moonscape like terrain where the surface can be unstable after rain or drought it is criss crossed by high power cables and dug up by building sized excavators. When breaking up protesters' blockades German police have in the past employed high powered water jets and pepper spray. Lecuyer says that some activists experience a form of trauma ... due to the high emotions from stress and excitement and the physical effort because you have to walk for miles in groups to the target pass police roadblocks sometimes under water cannon or pepper spray and then hold the blockade.

California Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown issued an executive order Monday mandating carbon neutrality by 2045 then ordering the state to maintain net negative emissions thereafter. Browns executive order came the same day hesigned into lawa bill mandating California get 100 percent of its electricity from renewables and zero carbon energy sources. Brown is also preparing to host a global warming activist summit Wednesday. California is committed to doing whatever is necessary to meet the existential threat of climate change Brown said Monday. But have no illusions California and the rest of the world have miles to go before we achieve zero carbon emissions. Brown is right in one sense. California does have miles to go to meet Browns executive order because it relies on magical thinking and science fiction according to experts. Existing executive orders call for California to cut greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 and state law requires emissions to be cut 40 percent by 2030. However thats not enough to meet the goals of the Paris climate accord according to United Nations models. What Brownorderedis not just reducing emissions but instead implied sucking more greenhouse gas out of the air than human activities in his state put up and not just for electricity. Browns order applies to the entire economy including transportation and agriculture. So what does negative emissions mean in practice? Well no one really knows but experts have put forward ideas to suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Browns office said negative emissions would be achieved through increased carbon sequestration in forests soils and other natural landscapes according to itspress release. But how would this even work?RELATED A New Report Details How Nonprofits Are Funneling Millions To Democratic Governors To Further Their Global Warming Agenda Scientists have also proposed technologies to literally suck carbon dioxide from the air and store it underground or in the ocean. Experts have also suggested reforestation ocean fertilization and whats known as enhanced weathering. Enhanced weathering is the rather hilarious idea that one can use rocks to in effect store CO2 emissions. In theory the rocks would react with CO2 and water to form an alkaline solution that leaks into the ocean. However all of these proposals remains magical thinking at this point according to aneditorialin the journal Nature. Enhanced weathering for example would require an area about the size of Texas of US agricultural land every year just to soak up 13 of the annual global emissions from agriculture according to Nature. Another proposed technology thats cited by the IPCC is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage BECCS. This is basically removing CO2 through growing plants which are then burned for energy. The emissions are then captured and stored underground. Of course BECCS is another magical solution thats baked into the IPCCs models of what needs to be done to limit future global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. University of Colorado professor Roger Pielke Jr. recentlypublished a paperon the problems with the UNs use of BECCS to sell the Paris climate accord. Carbon dioxide removal at massive scale is science fiction like a light saber incredible but not real Pielke wrote. Yet BECCS plays a very real role in todays climate policy arena Pielke wrote by helping to maintain the climate policy envelope and save us from having to do the enormously difficult and uncomfortable work of thinking how we might go about addressing accumulating carbon dioxide in the atmosphere differently than we have since the 1980s and 90s. If nothing else full implementation of BECCS at scale would require the use of a global land area one and a half times the size of India Pielke wrote about the staggering environmental cost of negative emissions technology. Indeed the European Academies Science Advisory Councilconcludedin early 2018 that negative emissions technologies offer only limited realistic potential to remove carbon from the atmosphere and not at the scale envisaged in some climate scenarios.

Newly released emails show senior Environmental Protection Agency officials working closely with a conservative group that dismisses climate change to rally like minded people for public hearings on science and global warming counter negative news coverage and promote Administrator Scott Pruitt's stewardship of the agency. John Konkus EPA's deputy associate administrator for public affairs repeatedly reached out to senior staffers at the Heartland Institute according to the emails. If you send a list we will make sure an invitation is sent Konkus wrote to then Heartland president Joseph Bast in May 2017 seeking suggestions on scientists and economists the EPA could invite to an annual EPA public hearing on the agency's science standards. Follow up emails show Konkus and the Heartland Institute mustering scores of potential invitees known for rejecting scientific warnings of man made climate change including from groups like Plants Need CO2 The Right Climate Stuff and Junk Science. The emails underscore how Pruitt and senior agency officials have sought to surround themselves with people who share their vision of curbing environmental regulation and enforcement leading to complaints from environmentalists that he is ignoring the conclusions of the majority of scientists in and out of his agency especially when it comes to climate changing carbon emissions. They were obtained by the Environmental Defense Fund and the Southern Environmental Law Center which sued to enforce a Freedom of Information Act request and provided them to The Associated Press. The EPA maintains close working relationships with a broad range of public and private groups and Heartland is just one of many the agency engages with to ensure the public is informed said EPA spokesman Lincoln Ferguson. It demonstrates the agency's dedication to advancing President Trump's agenda of environmental stewardship and regulatory certainty he said. The public hearing referred to in the May 2017 email ultimately was canceled when the EPA official who runs it fell ill the EPA said. But Bast contended in an email sent to EPA staffers and others that the official called off the hearing after learning that climate change skeptics planned to attend. The Heartland Institute calls itself a leading free market think tank. It rejects decades of science saying fossil fuel emissions are altering the climate and says on its website that curbing use of petroleum and coal to fight climate change would squander one of America's greatest comparative advantages among the world's nations. Of course The Heartland Institute has been working with EPA on policy and personnel decisions Tim Huelskamp a former Republican congressman from Kansas who now leads the group said in a statement to the AP. They recognized us as the pre eminent organization opposing the radical climate alarmism agenda and instead promoting sound science and policy Huelskamp wrote. He said Heartland would continue to help Pruitt and his staff. Ferguson said Pruitt and his top officials have also met with groups known for their campaigns against climate changing emissions and pollutants from fossil fuels including the Moms Clean Air Force the American Lung Association and others. But Ben Levitan of the Environmental Defense Fund said mainstream climate change groups have received nothing like the outreach and invitations that Heartland and other hard right groups have been getting. Certainly in some ways this is normal and in the course of business that ebbs and flows with the ideology of the administration in power said Meredith McGehee executive director of Issue One a non profit promoting ethical government and bipartisan political reform. Heartland is not registered as a lobbying group. Spokesman Jim Lakely said the group has logged its contacts with EPA and that they fall below the level required for disclosing as lobbying. An email last February shows Bast forwarded to followers an email with the line From the White House rallying activists to public hearings the EPA was then holding around the country on repealing an Obama era power plan meant to curb fossil fuel emissions. The email is signed by a Pruitt political appointee and gives the name of another EPA official for activists to call. It's not clear from the email however who initiated the attempt to rally conservatives for the public hearing. Konkus was a Republican political consultant when Pruitt named him to the agency. His duties include reviewing awards of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants. The Washington Post reported in September that Konkus had been scrutinizing grant applications for mentions of climate change which he reportedly calls the double C word. Emails show he and former EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman repeatedly reached out to Heartland to talk over critical coverage by the Post. Lakely the Heartland spokesman responds he's shared the article with colleagues asking them to jump to your aide sic and defend this position. Konkus also contacted Heartland and other conservative groups asking for what he calls echo amplifying word of Pruitt's regulation cutting efforts according to the emails. And an email from Bast shared with EPA staffers and others shows the then Heartland president celebrating news that a reporter Justin Gillis was leaving The New York Times.

California's reign as the U.S. state with the worst air pollution continuesas Los Angeles is again the nation's smoggiest metro area according to a report released Wednesday. LAisn't alone when it comes to smog chokedcities in California seven of the nation's top 10 smoggiest cities are in the Golden State including other sprawling cities such as San Francisco San Diego and Sacramento. Los Angeles has had the worst smog for 19 years of the 20 year history of the report. The bad news came fromthe American Lung Association's annual State of the Air report which covers the years 2015 2017. Smog forms on warm sunny days and is made worse by chemicals that exit vehicle tailpipes and power plant and industrial smokestacks. Warmer temperatures make ozone more likely to form. The report covers the two main types of air pollution that plague the USA smog also known as ground level ozone and soot technically known as particulate matter.

Soot pollution is deadlier and more of a health hazard than smog causingmore premature deaths and lung cancer the lung association said. California's air quality is worsening despite having the strongest environmental regulations in the nation said John Balmes of the University of California San Francisco at a news conference Tuesday. California's soaring population and topography allow air pollution to overcome the state's strict environmental laws the lung association said. The boom in people brings an increase in cars and trucks on the roads and many of those people live in valleys and basins right where pollution tends to settle. Nearly year round sunny skies don't help Those picture perfect days are a major factor in high levels of ozone pollution. The state would be much worse off without its strict laws on tailpipe pollution and eliminating coal fired power plants. The bad news about air pollutionspread nationwide in thereport Smog and soot choked air is worsening amid heat waves and bigger wildfires as environmental protections are rolled back. Many cities increased the number of days when sootsoared to record breaking levels the report says andmore cities suffered from higher numbers of days when smogreached unhealthy levels. About 141 million Americans live with unhealthful levels of air pollution the report says placing them at risk for premature death lung cancer asthma attacks cardiovascular damage and developmental and reproductive harm. This is a higher number than either of the reports from 2017 and 2018. On the other end of the scale only six metro areas recorded no days when smog or short term soot pollution reached unhealthy levels according to the report Bangor Maine Burlington Vermont Honolulu Lincoln Nebraska Wilmington North Carolina and the Melbourne Florida metro area.

Billionaire Tom Steyer is keeping a low profile with respect to his support for the Democratic Partys Green New Deal. Its an unusual position for one of the environmentalist movements biggest advocates. Steyer has stayed mum on an all encompassing climate resolution that promises to completely remake the American economy. Hes given faint praise for the GND in a tweet and a few sparse press statements but the Democratic megadonor is instead focusing on impeaching the president. Theclimate resolution which was rolled out by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez on Feb. 7 callsfor 10 year national mobilizations toward a series of goals aimed at fighting global warming. A separate fact sheetclaimsthe plan would mobilize every aspect of American society. Steyers relative inaction comes as critics slam the GNDs coming out party. Ocasio Cortezs office provided NPR the GND resolution and its accompanying FAQ document that laid out its goals namely to move America to 100 clean and renewable energy within 10 years. The FAQ document dump turned into a millstone around Democrats proverbial necks. Among other things the document claimed that Americans must upgrade or replace every building in US for state of the art energy efficiency if they are to rid the country and world of all forms of pollution and greenhouse gases. It also stated that the GND would provide benefits for people unwilling to work. Ocasio Cortezs staff was forced to ding the document from the website and clarify the lawmakers position. The drama unfolded less than a day after the Feb. 7 rollout of the now beleaguered deal. Steyer for his part issued a tweet on the day of the rollout cheering the New York Democrats ambitious play. A real solution proposed in Washington? About time!! Lets make the liars and deniers explain why this doesnt HAVE to happen he told his Twitter followers at the time. Steyer didnt mention the GND again until several days later when Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts published a statement on his website noting Steyers support. Our society needs to turn dramatically and immediately towards the shared goals of environmental justice broad based prosperity and health. The Green New Deal is that turnSteyer said in the Feb. 13 statement. Steyers political action group NextGen America has not responded to The Daily Caller News Foundations request for comment. Some critics believe it makes sense why the former hedge fund manager is staying mum. Christopher Horner a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute told TheDCNF that Steyers reticence to leap into the fray is probably a smart tactic given the GDNs controversy. I think I would avoid wide circulation too Horner said adding that the same people who couldnt create a healthcare website apparently cant even properlypostto a website. He often engages in legal battles against attorneys who sue energy companies over climate change. Other analysts shared similar sentiments. Hes calculating. Its not overly popular EE Legal President Craig Richardson told TheDCNF referring to the GND which received waives of support from various Democratic presidential candidates. Hes all in on climate program. Its a trial balloon so hes smart enough not to jump into that right away. Its really not politically expedient to come all the way out for it he said of Steyers reticence. Richardsons group is also on the front lines in battles against anti oil activists. Steyer is plowing another 6 million into what some Democratic leaders worry is an ill fated attempt to impeach the president. He decided not to run against President Donald Trump in January citing concerns about his business dealings and past fossil fuel investments.

The American political conversation about climate is indeed scary and depressing. But the decarbonization of the real U.S. economy as opposed to the cardboard fossil fuel handicapped White House version continues. Indeed decarbonization is accelerating giving me confidence that in a year or so it will be clear to everyone that the U.S. is on track to meet and perhaps exceed its inadequate 2025 Paris objective cutting emissions 26 28 percent. That goal requires reducing emissions by 1800 million tons of CO2.At the end of 2016 the U.S. was almost halfway emissions down 850 million tons or 13 percent.This progress was led by the utility sector where efficiency renewables and natural were replacing coal so fast that power sector carbon was down 25 percent. The world rightfully worries when they hear Donald Trump proclaim he is going to bring back coal and watch the administration and the Republican Congress try to roll back such common sense requirements limits on the wasteful flaring and leaking of methane from oil and gas fields. But Trumps promise to have America withdraw from the Paris climate agreement has sparked a stunning wave of climate leadership from U.S. cities states and businesses a wave that is still building but by the time it crests may more than make up for Trumps stubborn foot dragging. Lets begin with bringing back coal. Since Trump was elected no new coal plants have been announced or opened 10 plants with 5600 megawatts instead have announced they will shut down. West Virginias largest utility wont expand coal generation because it cant find customers for coal power CSX a leading coal hauling railroad thinks coal is going away so fast that it has stopped replacing coal rail cars.Nowthe Sierra Club has estimated that additional coal plants whose retirement have already been announced would cut emissions about 160 million tons. Closing vulnerable plants facilities that no longer make economic sense to keep operating could avoid another 275 million tons. If present trends continue the club also documented that the U.S. could triple renewable electricity overall the utility sector should be emitting 500 million tons of carbon less in 2025 than it was just last year. While coal fades state governments representing almost 60 percentof the American economy are racing forward.In January California released its plan to cut its emissions by 40 percent by 2030 and went on to extend its cap and trade program for another decade until 2030 this time with support for the first time from the oil industry! California is also on the verge of requiring 100 percent of its power to come from renewables. Overall a dozen states are debating increasing their reliance on renewable power.Maryland just established a 25 percent renewable power goal overriding the veto of a Republican governor. The Nevada legislature went for 40 percent but has not yet been able to overturn a similar veto. The 15early adaptor states in the Climate Alliance will report this week that they are already on track to reduce their 2025 emissions by 24 29 percent. And some of Americas most Republican climate skeptical states Oklahoma Kansas North Dakota and even Texas are steadily replacing coal with renewables for economic reasons. These dont usually get counted in reporting on bottom up climate action but they have a huge positive impact on emissions. Whether their state legislatures and governors are leading on climate or not Americas cities where most of our climate pollution originates are embracing a decarbonized future.In June when Trump promised to pull out of the Paris agreement 125 cities told the world we are still in the Paris agreement.Today only three months later the number has ballooned to 238. The U.S. Conference of Mayors representing more than 1000 of Americas largest cities voted unanimously to endorse the goal of 100 percent renewable power and since Trumps election the number of U.S. cities with 100 percent policies has mushroomed more than 40 cities are now committed individually and five have hit that target! But government is not alone.The private sector where companies are increasingly competing with each other to succeed in the carbon free economy of the future is making Trumps climate denial braggadocio increasingly irrelevant. The Mars Candy Company recently committed a billion dollars to ensure that its operations and supply chain would reduce their climate impact by 67 percent by 2050. The number of companies who have signed the pledge of support for the Paris agreement has almost doubled from 906 in June to 1729 this week. And global firms will impact the U.S. climate footprint. VW announced a few days ago that it will offer electric versions of all its models entering the competition against current global EV leader U.S. based Tesla which delivered its first Model 3 in July. It is true the Trump administration is struggling to hold back the future with appalling decisions like EPAs recent announcement that it would delay cleaning up toxic water pollution from coal power plants for two years.But the courts are steadily shredding much of this the conservative 10th circuit just ruled that Trump must consider climate impacts before issuing new coal leases on federal lands. As the CEO of one of Americas historically coal dependent utilities Tom Fanning of the Southern Company says You cant keep waves off the beach.King Canute knew this. And the decarbonization of the American economy the real economy not the fake news economy shows its still true.The world can see and measure America is still in.	False	True	False	True	False
Low lying Pacific atolls United Nations officials warn are on the front line of climate change due to rising sea levels are on the whole stable or increasing in sizeaccording to a study. The study published in the journal WIREs Climate Change in September adds to the growing evidence that small island nations in the Pacific and Indian Oceans are proving resilient to rising seas in the face of predictions they may eventually become uninhabitable. In total 88.6 of islands were either stable or increased in size author Virginie K. E. Duvat of the University of La Rochelle wrote in thestudy. Importantly islands located in ocean regions affected by rapid sea level rise showed neither contraction nor marked shoreline retreat which indicates that they may not be affected yet by the presumably negative that is erosive impact of sea level rise Duvat wrote. That may come as a shock in light of reports that Pacific Islanders in places like Kiribati are becoming climate refugees because of rising sea levels which many scientists blame on greenhouse gas emissions. When the United Nations met in 2015 to hash out the Paris climate accord Kiribati joined other island nations in calling for an international agreement to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Its a matter of survival former Kiribati President Anote Tong said after meeting with former U.S. President Barack Obama that year. Nearly 200 countries eventually signed onto the Paris climate accord. A 2017 CBS News feature on Kiribatis plight claimed that scientists predict the island nation could be uninhabitable within decades and that high tides that inundate their homes already contaminate their water and kill their crops. However Duvats study found Kiribatis North Tarawa island chain was stable with most islands gaining land and that the South Tarawa chain actually increased in size showing the most growth of any atoll studied. In another case one Maldives official predicted rising sea levels would completely cover this Indian Ocean nation of 1196 small islands within the next 30 years. That warning was made in 1988 amid heightened urgency about global warming. Instead Duvatfound that more than 70 percent of the Maldives Huvadhoo islands were stable and that 6 percent had increased in size and only 23 percent decreased in size. The reanalyzed global data reveal that atolls did not lose land area and that 73.1 of islands were stable in land area including most settled islands while 15.5 of islands increased and 11.4 decreased in size Duvat wrote. Scientists worry that future warming could pose problems for low lying islands many of which are no more than a few feet above the water but other human interventions ocean currents and storms likely exert an even bigger role than climate changes. For example Duvat found that land reclamation and causeway construction caused major changes in island land area and configuration not only in urban but also in rural atolls. Also the removal and the clearing of the native vegetation respectively caused marked changes in island configuration and shoreline destabilization on some islands Duvat wrote. Studies have increasingly shown theres been no widespread disappearance of low lying atolls and coral islands have despite rising sea levels. RELATED North Carolina Gov Roy Cooper Says New Green Policies Will Lessen The Impact Of Hurricanes The United Nations latest reportin October noted that models and other evidence indicate that unconstrained Pacific atolls have kept pace with sea level rise with little reduction in size or experienced a net gain in land. Indeed a February study by New Zealand researcher Paul Kench found eight of Tuvalus nine atolls and three quarters of its reef islands grew over the last four decades. The study findings may seem counter intuitive given that sea level has been rising in the region over the past half century but the dominant mode of change over that time on Tuvalu has been expansion not erosionKench said in February. The U.N. report however also warns that with continued warming Small islands are projected to be at risk and very sensitive to coastal climate change and other stressors. Duvat found only instability on islands smaller than 25 acres but even then only a small number actually decreased in size.	True	False	False	True	False
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrives at a meeting of the National Space Council in Chantilly Va. on Oct. 5 2017. Photo Andrew HarnikAP President Trumps dismissal of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson Tuesday morning fulfilled a long held wish for climate advocates but they fear his replacement CIA Director Mike Pompeo will be even worse. Tillerson joined Exxon in 1975 and rose through the ranks over the decades. He was CEO and chairman of ExxonMobil from 2006 until he joined the Trump administration in 2017. That Trump would nominate a lifelong oilman to succeed John Kerry who led the U.S. through the Paris climate negotiations of late 2015 as the nations top diplomat resulted in predictable and fierce pushback. During his confirmation hearing in January 2017 however Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he thought the United States should stay in the Paris Agreement which strives to reduce global warming to 2C 3.6F. He also suggested that a carbon tax may be the best way to limit the greenhouse gas emissions driving global warming. Pompeo on the other hand identified with the tea party and represented Kansass Fourth Congressional District from 2011 to 2017. He received more financial backing from Koch Industries an energy and natural resources conglomerate than any other candidate in the 2010 elections 80000. In fact according to the Center for Responsive Politics a bipartisan research group that tracks the effect of lobbying on elections and policy Pompeo has received more money from Koch interests than any other House member. In just four election cycles 2010 2012 2014 2016 he received the following 335000 from Koch Industries employees which includes 92000 from the Koch family 69000 from theKoch Industries PAC 417175 from Americans for Prosperity an advocacy group funded by the Kochs and 87532 from other organizations with substantial funding by the Koch brothers. And Pompeo turned to the Koch brothers who actively oppose climate change legislation for money long before running for office. In the late 90s Koch Industries invested in an aerospace company Pompeo founded with fellow West Point alumni. He sold his interest in Thayer Aerospace in 2006 and became president of Sentry International which produces and sells oil field equipment. In short even though environmentalists adamantly opposed Tillerson they do not expect anything positive for the climate from Pompeo. Jake Schmidt the international program director at the Natural Resources Defense Council released the following statement Replacing the man from Big Oil with a first class climate denier simply goes from bad to worse. This shuffling of the deck chairs will ensure that Washington continues to bring up the rear when it comes to international action to combat dangerous climate change. Tiernan Sittenfeld senior vice president of government affairs for the League of Conservation Voters said in a statement that Pompeos nomination is profoundly disturbing but not unexpected. Though not surprising this is extremely troubling. Climate change is one of the most critical threats facing our nation and world and the secretary of state has a huge responsibility to make sure it is addressed by the global community she said. With a history of questioning the science of climate change a close relationship with the polluter Koch brothers and lifetime LCV score of 4 Mike Pompeo has no business becoming the next secretary of state. Naomi Ages the climate director of Greenpeace USA was similarly perturbed. Donald Trump has now somehow picked someone even worse than Rex Tillerson to run the State Department. Greenpeace has been opposed to Tillerson as secretary of state from the moment he was nominated and we continue to believe that the U.S. government cannot and should not be run by fossil fuel industry flunkies Ages said in a statement. Mike Pompeo though is uniquely unqualified to be secretary of state in an entirely different way than Rex Tillerson was. In addition to being a climate denier like his predecessor Pompeo is Koch brothers shill who will denigrate the United States reputation abroad and make us vulnerable to threats at home. Rep. Barbara Lee D Calif. also took issue with Pompeos past statements on climate change.	False	False	False	True	True
The internal combustion engines days may be numbered in California where officials are mulling whether a ban on sales of polluting autos is needed to achieve long term targets for cleaner air. Governor Jerry Brown has expressed an interest in barring the sale of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines Mary Nichols chairman of the California Air Resources Board said in an interview Friday at Bloomberg headquarters in New York.The earliest such a ban is at least a decade away she said. Brown one of the most outspoken elected official in the U.S. about the need for policies to combat climate change would be replicating similar moves by China France and the U.K. Ive gotten messages from the governor asking Why havent we done something already? Nichols said referring to Chinas planned phase out of fossil fuel vehicle sales. The governor has certainly indicated an interest in why China can do this and not California. Embracing such a policy would send shockwaves through the global car industry due to the heft of Californias auto market. More than 2 million new passenger vehicles were registered in the state last year topping France Italy or Spain. If a ban were implemented automakersfrom General Motors Co. to Toyota Motor Corp. would be under new pressure to make electric vehicles the standard for personal transportation in the most populous U.S. state casting fresh doubts on the future of gasoline and diesel powered autos elsewhere. The Association of Global Automakers said consumers must be able to afford the cleaner cars that California says are needed to meet its climate goals. The trade association represents Toyota Honda Motor Co. and other overseas carmakers in the U.S. We have been working with California on intelligent market based approaches to emissions reductions beyond 2025 and we hope that this doesnt signal an abandonment of that position Global Automakers Chief Executive Officer John Bozzella said in a statement. California has set a goal to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050. Rising emissions from on road transportation has undercut the states efforts to reduce pollutionaccording to Next 10 San Francisco based non profit. To reach the ambitious levels of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions we have to pretty much replace all combustion with some form of renewable energy by 2040 or 2050 Nichols said. Were looking at that as a method of moving this discussion forward. California has the authority to write its own pollution rules which dates back to the 1970 Clean Air Act. Those rules are underpinned by waivers granted by the Environmental Protection Agency. Nichols said the state would likely take a different legal route to enable a possible ban rather than use an EPA waiver since the Trump administration would be unlikely to approve one. For example California could use vehicle registration rules or control the vehicles that can access state highways she said. We certainly wouldnt expect to get a waiver for that from EPA Nichols said. I think we would be looking at using some of our other authorities to get to that result. Read more California Sets Demands for Auto Emission Talks With Trump China will likely order an end to sales of all polluting vehicles by 2030 the chairman of electric carmaker BYD Co. said Thursday. France and the U.K. have announced 2040 as their end date for sales of fossil fuel powered cars. A ban for California could also still be decades away from implementation and just how far out remains to be seen Nichols said. There are people who believe including who work for me that you could stop all sales of new internal combustion cars by 2030. Some people say 2035 some people say 2040 she said. Its awfully hard to predict any of that with precision but it doesnt appear to be out of the question.	False	False	False	True	False
Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd our email newsletter. WASHINGTON The Trump administration has completed its plan to roll back major offshore drilling safety regulations that were put in place after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster in 2010 that killed 11 people and caused the worst oil spill in American history. The Interior Departments Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement which was established after the spill in the Gulf of Mexico and regulates offshore oil and gas drilling has finalized a proposal for loosening the regulations as part of President Trumps efforts to ease restrictions on fossil fuel companies and encourage domestic energy production. The rules created potentially unduly burdensome requirements for oil and natural gas production operators on the Outer Continental Shelf without meaningfully increasing safety of the workers or protection of the environment says the new 176 page rule which is scheduled in the coming days to be published in the Federal Register before becoming the administrations final policy. This rule supports the administrations objective of facilitating energy dominance by encouraging increased domestic oil and gas production and reducing unnecessary burdens on stakeholders while ensuring safety and environmental protection the new rule says.

Donald Trump is moving to formally exit the Paris climate agreement making the United States the only country in the world that will not participate in the pact as global temperatures are set to rise 3C and worsening extreme weather will drive millions into poverty. The paperwork sent by the US government to withdraw begins a one year process for exiting the deal agreed to at the UN climate change conference in Paris in 2015. The Trump administration will not be able to finalize its exit until a day after the presidential election in November 2020. The secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced the development on Monday afternoon saying the agreement would be an unfair economic burden imposed on American workers businesses and taxpayers and that the US has already reduced its heat trapping emissions. But organizers of local city and state efforts to curb the crisis across America say the US is still trying to play a role in fighting the climate crisis despite the actions of the federal government. Carl Pope vice chair of the group Americas Pledge said its members who are vowing to keep fighting the climate emergency produce more than half the countrys heat trapping emissions and represent about 70 of the US gross domestic product. Another organization the US Climate Alliance includes the governors of 25 states representing 55 of the US population. In the Paris agreement the US agreed to cut its heat trapping pollution at least 26 below 2005 levels by 2025. Dozens of countries are also pursuing goals to reach net zero emissions by 2050. But they represent only about 11 of the worlds climate footprint and exclude the biggest emitters China the US and India. Staying on par with those more advanced countries would require the US government to eliminate pollution from coal and natural gas powered electricity plants transportation manufacturing facilities and agriculture. Local action by itself is not likely to be enough. We dont think its likely just with the states we have we think we need the whole country to be moving together Pope said. Jean Su energy director with the Center for Biological Diversitys Climate Law Institute said America is the number one historical contributor to the climate emergency wreaking havoc in burning California the flooded Southeast and the rest of the world. The next president must repay this extraordinary climate debt by rapidly moving America to 100 clean energy and financing the decarbonization of the Global South Su said referring to the developing world. In addition the Trump administration has also pulled US funding commitments to help the developing world cut pollution. John Kerry and Chuck Hagel president Barack Obamas secretaries of state and defense respectively in a Washington Post op ed called it a dark day for America. Climate change is already affecting every sector and region of the United States as hundreds of top scientists from 13 federal agencies made clear in a report the White House itself released last year they said. The past five years were the warmest ever recorded. Without steep pollution reductions climate change will risk tens of thousands of US lives every year by the end of the century. They called the Paris agreement a start not a finish line but the best ignition switch the world could agree on to spark international cooperation on this critical issue. Senator Tom Carper the top Democrat on the Senate environment panel said Once again President Trump is abandoning our global allies for the sake of misplaced political gain. Now America stands alone nearly 200 countries have joined this global commitment to fighting climate change even global pariahs like North Korea and civil war torn countries like Syria. Carper said Trump is abandoning tremendous economic opportunity and public health benefits. Trumphas alternately ignored or denied the climate crisis. His agencies are nixing regulations for power plants and cars and bolstering fossil fuels whenever possible. He promised to widespread dismay to exit the Paris agreement during his campaign. The Democratic 2020 election frontrunners challenging Trump have all said they would set the country on a path to neutralize its climate pollution by 2050. Nate Hultman director of the University of Marylands center for global sustainability and lead author of this years Americas Pledge report pointed to new laws in New Mexico Nevada Washington Maine New York Washington DC and Puerto Rico for 100 clean energy targets. Hawaii and California already had such laws. Together they represent 16 of the nations electricity more than doubling the share from 2018 he said. Another way to think about it is that Trumps decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement is supported in reality by only about 30 of the economy and 35 of the population Hultman said. Even once the US withdraws the country can participate as an observer in international climate negotiations. But despite the efforts of subnational governments recent analysis shows the US is still far off track from its commitments regardless of whether Trump pulled out. The US is also far from neutralizing climate emissions by the middle of the century which as many experts say will be necessary for all countries in order to avert the worst of the crisis. We can still get there with a serious shift in policy in the coming years said Kate Larsen director of Rhodiums international energy and climate research.	False	False	False	True	False
BERLIN Green parties in Germany France Britain and elsewhere celebrated big gains in elections for the 751 seat European Parliament amid growing voter concerns over climate change expressed in large scale student protests over recent months. Provisional results Monday showed the left leaning Greens bloc coming fourth in the election with 69 seats an increase of 17 compared with 2014. If confirmed the results could put the Greens in a position to tip the scales when it comes to choosing the next head of the European Commission. The rise of the Greens with their distinctly pro European Union stance marks a counterpoint to that of the far right anti migrant parties that have been growing in popularity across Europe in recent years. Whoever wants legitimacy from us and the legitimacy of the many who went onto the streets will need to deliver now said Sven Giegold a leading candidate for the German Green party that scooped up more than 20 of the vote nationwide an increase of almost 10 compared with 2014. READ MORE Europes voters elect new parliament as nationalism mounts voters elect new parliament as nationalism mounts The drift from the traditional heavyweight parties to the Greens in Germany was particularly pronounced in large cities such as Berlin Munich and Hamburg and among young voters where the party beat its bigger rivals among all voters under 60 according to the Infratest dimap research institute. Armin Laschet the governor of Germanys most populous state North Rhine Westphalia and a member of Chancellor Angela Merkels center right Union bloc called the outcome a wake up call for politics. In neighboring France 25 of voters aged 18 25 voted for the Greens compared with 15 for the far right National Rally and 12 for President Emmanuel Macrons Republic on the Move according to the Ifop polling organization. Overall the French green party EELV received almost 13.5 of the vote coming third. Yannick Jadot lead candidate of EELV welcomed the great green wave in Europe. The French sent us a very clear message they want environment to be at the heart of our lives at the heart of the political game and that message has been spread across Europe he said. The very good score of the greens in Germany Luxembourg Belgium and France sends a signal that the center of gravity of the European politics is shifting that in addition to the populists and the pro business parties there are the Greens Jadot said. Green parties also polled strongly in Austria Sweden Ireland Denmark and the Netherlands. In Britain the Greens a largely insignificant force nationally took 11 seats in the European Parliament vote. This was kind of a vote for all europhile and pro integration positions the Greens have championed Martin Florack a political scientist at the University of Duisburg Essen told German public broadcaster ARD. The enmity was reflected in comments by Alexander Gauland the co leader of the far right Alternative for Germany party who declared the Greens our main enemy on Monday. The Greens will destroy this country and our job must and will be to fight the Greens said Gauland whose party has claimed climate change isnt a man made phenomenon but instead caused by factors such as solar activity a theory most scientists dismiss. A senior member of the anti immigration and euroskeptic Danish Peoples Party Kenneth Kristensen Berth said the issues of the climate and the environment were a bit hysterical during the election but insisted that Denmarks second largest political group is not a climate denial party. Among those celebrating the Greens rise was Biggi Tran a 26 year old in Berlin. She attributed the result to young peoples fears about global warming. The climate issue is super important at the moment Tran said. Manuel Rivera a Green party member in the Germany capital said the European Parliament was the right place to tackle climate change. I think people realize that there are issues you cant solve at the national level he said. Giegold the German Greens lead candidate said voters expect the party to deliver on its environmental pledges not secure powerful posts in the executive European Commission. Across Europe this was a vote to protect the climate he said. People didnt take to the streets to elect or kick out a party but for these problems to be solved. Green lawmakers in the European Parliament plan to scrutinize the blocs 200 billion euro 223.7 billion agriculture budget which environmentalists say places too much emphasis on large scale farming and not enough on eco friendly agriculture he said. The Greens also want every law passed at the EU level to undergo a climate check. The party has strongly backed scientists calls for the bloc to end all greenhouse gas emissions by mid century. Achieving this goal would require a drastic shift in Europes economy away from fossil fuels to clean energy and low carbon lifestyles. Some measures proposed for cutting emissions have already faced strong headwind including Macrons plan for a fuel tax hike in France that triggered protests from workers even as environmentalists accused the president of not doing enough for the climate. Sylvie Corbet in Paris and Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin contributed to this report. 	False	False	False	False	False
As Hurricane Michael pummeled the Gulf coast a less deadly but equally ferocious media storm formed around Florida Governor Rick Scott whose alleged climate change denial has been blamed for putting Floridians in harm's way. Viral videos New York Times op eds and Guardian contributors all highlighted Rick Scott's backward stance on climate change after Michael a powerful typhoon made landfall along the Florida Panhandle. According to these media reports and commentaries Scott's science denial has endangered Florida residents. In other words if Scott were more vocal about man made climate change Florida would have been better prepared for or perhaps could have even prevented the devastating hurricane. Florida is the state most endangered by climate change declares a video published by Now This. But Gov. Scott's strategy for dealing with it is denial. The New York Times' Nicholas Kristof also took Scott to task for his stance on climate change writing that alas denying climate change doesn't actually prevent it. He added Some folks will say this isn't the moment for politics. But don't we have a responsibility to mitigate the next disaster? It's true that Scott who is currently running for the Senate has shown little interest in highlighting or combating the alleged dangers of climate change. In 2015 after the governor took office the Florida Department of Environment was reportedly banned from using the terms climate change and global warming. Two years later Scott signed a bill that critics dubbed the anti science law which allows residents to file complaints about instructional materials used in public schools. Scott has a section on his website dedicated to environmental issues but it is curiously absent of any direct mentions of climate change. However his website does note that Scott fought to protect Florida's coastline by getting Florida removed from consideration for offshore oil drilling and securing millions of dollars in state funding to help local governments with coastal resilience projects and sea level rise planning. On the campaign trail Scott has dodged questions about climate change resorting to responses such as I'm not a scientist to avoid weighing in on the subject. The motive behind Scott's alleged science denial has also received media attention. Last year the Tampa Bay Times alleged that Scott's personal business ties to the energy industry may be the reason for the state's legislative inaction on climate change. The paper claimed that Scott had hefty investments in petroleum companies that oppose restrictions on greenhouse gases and other environmental regulations.

According to The Guardian anyone who isn't a fervent believer in man made climate change is to blame for Hurricane Michael even the hurricane's victims. Victims of Hurricane Michael voted for climate deniersreads the headline an op ed published in The Guardian on Thursday. Elections have consequences. Denying science has consequences. And we are reaping what we sow the subhead states matter of factly. The headline was later amended to Victims of Hurricane Michael are represented by climate deniers. Climate deniers are making these storms worse by stopping action on climate change. What the hell do we expect to happen when the deniers are writing the laws? the commentary penned by John Abraham a professor of thermal sciences asks rhetorically. Social media users appeared to largely line up behind the allegations hurled at Scott although some seemed unconvinced that the governor was at fault. Rick Scott can ban the term all he wants in FLORIDA. Climate change is real one Twitter user wrote. He's bought and paid for claimed another. Others were less accusatory. It's not our words that are negatively affecting the atmosphere. It's the damage we are doing to the planet one Twitter user noted in response to the Now This video. Lol. Like the weather would give a crap if he went mute a netizen observed. At least six people have been killed as a result of Hurricane Michael the third most powerful storm ever to hit the US mainland according to officials. The hurricane made landfall as a Category 4 storm but later weakened to a Category 1 on Wednesday night. As Hurricane Michael gradually loses strength however it appears that the media storm over the consequences of climate change denial is only growing. Will the devastation wrought by Michael and all future hurricanes be laid at the feet of science deniers? Like this story? Share it with a friend!	True	False	False	True	False
New U.S. Climate Assessment Forecasts Dire Effects On Economy Health The Trump administration released a major climate assessment on Black Friday the culmination of years of research by the country's top climate scientists. It's well over 1000 pages and touches on a daunting range of topics. President Trump said Monday that he has read parts of it. It's fine he told reporters at the White House although he said he doesn't believe the report's assessment that climate change will cause devastating economic impacts for the U.S. The report is required by Congress every four years and is issued by 13 federal agencies and the U.S. Global Change Research Program. This one marks the most detailed and blunt assessment yet of the dangers of unchecked global warming. Climate change is happening here and now co author Katherine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University told Weekend Edition Saturday. It is affecting all of us no matter where we live. And the more climate changes the more serious and even more dangerous the impacts will become. Here are some key points. Some parts of the U.S. economy could suffer hundreds of billions of dollars in annual losses by the end of the century unless global greenhouse gas emissions are substantially reduced the report finds. Already there's the impact of increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather events. The report notes that large wildfires are more frequent and that the areas burned by lightning ignited fires are expected to increase by at least 30 percent by 2060. The costs for fighting fires and forest management are on the rise see chart. But there are other less obvious risks. Don't see the graphic above? Click here Increasing rain and humidity could cause agricultural productivity to fall in the Midwest and warming oceans will hurt fisheries. Along the coasts more severe flooding threatens billions of dollars' worth of property and infrastructure which in turn could affect the economic stability of local governments businesses and the broader economy. Extreme weather events could also cause price spikes and interrupt international trade. As an example the report notes that flooding in Thailand in 2011 disrupted production of Ford and Honda vehicles in the U.S. and cost a U.S. based hard drive manufacturer 199 million in losses. Again the rise of extreme events like wildfires floods and storm surges poses the most immediate danger to public health and well being. The report finds that with continued warming heat related deaths will increase. The warming climate and more frequent and intense rain might also expand the range of ticks and mosquitoes exposing more people to diseases like West Nile dengue fever chikungunya and Lyme. Climate change could also worsen harmful ozone levels and air pollution. That could send more people to the hospital for aggravated asthma and respiratory or cardiovascular problems and could even increase premature deaths. As with so many climate impacts the report notes that those most at risk include children the elderly and low income communities. U.S. infrastructure was not built for these changes Much of America's infrastructure is already aging and deteriorating and it is taking a pounding from extreme weather. In some places more intense rain and saltwater intrusion have led to dam failures bridge and road closures and power outages. Heavier downpours can also overwhelm sewer systems causing untreated water to flow into rivers. In the West prolonged drought has forced utilities to cut back on electricity production from hydropower. Extreme heat and higher demand can also raise the risk of power outages. The report notes that power outages can affect drinking water treatment among many other services people take for granted. Intense rain flooding and heat can also hurt the nation's vast network of transportation shutting down major highways and coastal airports and halting freight movement. The report like most climate studies offers different scenarios for how fast the climate will change and by how much. The bigger the change the greater the consequences for everything from heat waves to hurricanes. The White House issued a statement criticizing the report as largely based on the most extreme scenario for emissions of greenhouse gases. The report is in fact based mostly on two scenarios One is the most severe view in which little or no effort is made to lower emissions. However it also uses a more moderate scenario one that sees more aggressive actions to reduce emissions than are currently underway less fossil fuel use for example or more efficient vehicles and buildings. And for some of its chapters the report considers a third far rosier future where emissions are drastically reduced and even where greenhouse gases are pulled back out of the atmosphere. Effects on people and the economy are considerably less dire under these scenarios than in the most severe one. Some communities are already adapting The good news in this dire report is that scores of local and state governments are taking action to lower their own carbon emissions and cope with climate impacts. Some of those impacts will get worse still no matter what as they are locked in due to historical emissions. But the report makes clear that changes today can make a big difference. It's absolutely not too late to take action says Brenda Ekwurzel a co author and senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The report states that more than half the projected damages of coastal property are estimated to be avoidable through well timed adaptation measures. But Ekwurzel cautions that we can't merely adapt our way out of this mess. The cost of adaptation could be quite high and it may never be enough she says. But costs will really start skyrocketing if we don't start reining in emissions.	True	False	False	True	True
The head of the Environmental Protection Agency has said America has nothing to apologise for on climate change and retains a seat at the negotiating table claiming After all were the United States. Scott Pruitt joined other officials in declining to say whether Donald Trump believes human activity contributes to climate change a day after the president pulled America out of the landmark Paris agreement. Pruitt claimed Trump wants better terms within the Paris framework or an entirely new deal and dismissed warnings from world leaders that it is not negotiable. Well thats up to them right? the EPA administrator told reporters. The United States has a seat at the table. After all were the United States and we are leading with respect to CO2 reduction. We have made tremendous progress. If nations around the globe want to seek to learn from us on what were doing to reduce our CO2 footprint were going to share that with them and thats something that should occur and will occur in the future. We will reach out and reciprocate with nations that seek to achieve that. Trump announced on Thursday that the US the worlds second biggest greenhouse gas emitter would immediately stop implementing the 195 nation agreement brokered by Barack Obama in 2015. There was a global backlash and the EU said on Friday it will increase cooperation with China to combat climate change. Pruitt denied that America has abandoned the victims of climate change around the world arguing that it has done a tremendous amount to reduce carbon output to 1990s levels and will stay engaged and continue to export relevant technology. This is not a message to anyone in the world that America should be apologetic of its CO2 position. Were actually making tremendous advances. Were just not going to agree to frameworks and agreements that put us at an economic disadvantage and hurt citizens across this country. He echoed Trumps attack on members of the agreement as having economic rather than environmental motives. The world applauded when we joined Paris and you know why? I think they applauded because they knew it was going to put this country at an economic disadvantage and the reason European leaders want us to stay in is because they know it will continue to shackle our economy though we are leading the world with respect to our CO2 reduction. The EPA administrator was asked repeatedly whether Trump believes climate change is a hoax as Trump previously claimed but refused to give a straight answer. Theres enough to deal with with respect to the Paris agreement and making an informed decision about this important issue he said. Thats where our focus has been the last several weeks. For his own part Pruitt acknowledged that global warming is occurring and that human activity contributes to it in some manner. But he added Measuring with precision from my perspective the degree of human contribution is very challenging. Sean Spicer the White House press secretary was similarly evasive on the topic. Asked if he can talk to Trump about the cause of climate change and report back at the next press briefing he replied If I can I will. Spicer gave short shrift to suggestions that Trumps decision will lift China as a global leader. I think part of the reason the president said it was a bad deal yesterday was because countries including China were not making substantial progress in reducing their carbon footprint. They werent doing enough and America was carrying the load so I think by negotiating a better deal hopefully we can get a better result for our country and the world. Nicaragua and Syria are the only countries not party to the Paris accord the former says it is not ambitious enough. Under a long exit process Americas withdrawal will not be become formal until November 2020.	True	True	False	True	True
Environmentalists in California are willing to let the state dictate how they cook in their own kitchens in an attempt to save the planet. Thirteen cities and one county in California have put in place zoning codes encouraging or requiring all electric new construction virtually banning builders from running natural gas lines into homes and apartments to fuel appliances including stoves and ovens. USA Today reported that people believe the move is necessary to fight climate change with an eye toward creating fewer legacy gas hookups as the nation shifts to carbon neutral energy sources. For natural gas companies its a threat to their existence. And for some cooks who love to prepare food with flame its an unthinkable loss. Natural gas is a fossil fuel mostly methane and produces 33 of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas causing climate change. Theres no pathway to stabilizing the climate without phasing gas out of our homes and buildings Rachel Golden of the Sierra Clubs building electrification campaign said. This is a must do for the climate and a livable planet. But the page linked to on the U.S. Energy Information Administration EIA website is referring ironically to CO2 emissions from the U.S. electric power sector by source for 2018. The new codes call for replacing gas with electricity. The federal website reports on the benefits of using natural gas as an energy source Burning natural gas for energy results in fewer emissions of nearly all types of air pollutants and carbon dioxide CO2 than burning coal or petroleum products to produce an equal amount of energy. About 117 pounds of carbon dioxide are produced per million British thermal units MMBtu equivalent of natural gas compared with more than 200 pounds of CO2 per MMBtu of coal and more than 160 pounds per MMBtu of distillate fuel oil. The clean burning properties of natural gas have contributed to increased natural gas use for electricity generation and as a transportation fuel for fleet vehicles in the United States. Probably the biggest stumbling block for most pondering an all electric home is the prospect of not having a gas stove USA Today reported. Its the only thing that people ever ask about Bruce Nilles who directs the building electrification program of the Rocky Mountain Institute a Colorado based think tank that focuses on energy and resource efficiency said in the USA Today report. According to a 2017 kitchen study by the NPD Group 35 percent of U.S. households have a gas stove while 55 percent have electric. But the number of natural gas customers is also rising USA Today reported. The American Gas Association which represents more than 200 local energy companies says an average of one new customer is added every minute. Thats exactly the wrong direction Nilles said. The idea that denying access to natural gas in new homes is necessary to meet emissions reduction goals is false American Gas Association President and CEO Karen Harbert. In fact denying access to natural gas could make meeting emissions goals harder and more expensive. They also say its more expensive to run an all electric home USA Today reported. A study by AGA released last year suggested that all electric homes would pay 750 to 910 a year more for energy related costs as well as amortized appliance and upgrade costs. USA Today also pointed out that California is not the only place where people want more government regulation. New York Hawaii Colorado and Maine have carbon neutrality goals and as many as 140 U.S. cities have similar plans.	False	False	False	False	False
LONDONSEOUL Reuters Temperatures are likely to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052 if global warming continues at its current pace and if the world fails to take rapid and unprecedented measures to stem the increase a U.N. report said on Monday. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC met last week in Incheon South Korea to finalize the report prepared at the request of governments in 2015 when a global pact to tackle climate change was agreed. The report is seen as the main scientific guide for government policymakers on how to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement. The Paris pact aims to limit global average temperature rise to well below 2C above pre industrial levels while seeking to tighten the goal to 1.5C. There has already been a rise of 1C since the mid 1800s as industrialization lifted emissions of carbon dioxide CO2 the main greenhouse gas blamed for climate change. A rise of 1.5C would still carry climate related risks for nature and mankind but the risks would be lower than a rise of 2C the report summary said. Meeting the 1.5C limit required rapid far reaching and unprecedented change in land and energy use industry buildings transport and cities it said adding temperatures would be 1.5C higher between 2030 and 2052 at the current pace. The targets agreed in Paris on cutting emissions would not be enough even if there were larger and more ambitious cuts after 2030 it said. To contain warming at 1.5C manmade global net carbon dioxide emissions would need to fall by about 45 percent by 2030 from 2010 levels and reach net zero by mid century. Any additional emissions would require removing CO2 from the air. Limiting warming to 1.5C is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics but doing so would require unprecedented changes said Jim Skea co chair of the IPCC working group which assesses climate change mitigation. The summary said renewable energy would need to supply 70 to 85 percent of electricity by 2050 to stay within a 1.5C limit compared with about 25 percent now. Using carbon capture and storage CCS technology the share of gas fired power would need to be cut to 8 percent and coal to between 0 and 2 percent. There was no mention of oil in this context in the summary. If the average global temperature temporarily exceeded 1.5C additional carbon removal techniques would be required to return warming to below 1.5C by 2100. But the report said the efficacy of measures such as planting forests bioenergy use or capturing and storing CO2 were unproven at a large scale and carried some risks. Steps like reflecting incoming solar radiation back into space were not assessed because of the uncertainties about using such technology the report said. It said keeping the rise in temperature to 1.5C would mean sea levels by 2100 would be 10 cm lower than if the warming was 2C the likelihood of an Arctic Ocean free of sea ice in summer would be once per century not at least once a decade and coral reefs would decline by 70 90 percent instead of being virtually wiped out. The report shows that we only have the slimmest of opportunities remaining to avoid unthinkable damage to the climate system that supports life as we know it said Amjad Abdulla the IPCC board member and chief negotiator for the alliance of small island states.

President Donald Trump has announced that the US is withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate agreement. He said moves to negotiate a new fair deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers would begin. Mr Trump said during last year's presidential election campaign that he would take the step to help his country's oil and coal industries. Opponents say withdrawing from the accord is an abdication of US leadership on a key global challenge. The Paris agreement commits the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures well below 2C above pre industrial levels and endeavour to limit them even more to 1.5C. Only Syria and Nicaragua did not sign up to the deal. Speaking in the White House Rose Garden Mr Trump characterised the Paris agreement as a deal that aimed to hobble disadvantage and impoverish the US. He claimed the agreement would cost the US 3tn in lost GDP and 6.5 million jobs while rival economies like China and India were treated more favourably. In order to fulfil my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord... but begin negotiations to re enter either the Paris accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States he said. The speech contained several rhetorical flourishes reminiscent of his campaign speeches. We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us any more and they won't be he said. I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh not Paris. I promised I would exit or re negotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests. Many trade deals will soon be under re negotiation. The BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan in Washington says the move will be welcomed by many Trump supporters as for them this is less about science and more about sending a signal to so called global elites. Analysts say the US withdrawal from the Paris agreement will make it more difficult for the world to reach the goals that it set for itself in the Paris agreement. The US contributes about 15 of global emissions of carbon but it is also a significant source of finance and technology for developing countries in their efforts to fight rising temperatures. Mr Trump did not give a timescale for US withdrawal but White House sources had earlier suggested it could take up to four years. Former US President Barack Obama who agreed to the Paris deal immediately criticised the move accusing the Trump administration of rejecting the future. Republican congressional leaders and the US coal industry backed the move with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell supporting Mr Trump for dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama administration's assault on domestic energy production and jobs. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the decision one of the worst policy moves made in the 21st Century because of the huge damage to our economy our environment and our geopolitical standing. The leaders of France Germany and Italy issued a joint statement rejecting a renegotiation of the agreement. We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible and we firmly believe that the Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated since it is a vital instrument for our planet societies and economies it said. This was echoed by UK Prime Minister Theresa May who expressed her disappointment and told Mr Trump in a phone call that the deal protects the prosperity and security of future generations. Leaders of the Nordic nations Sweden Finland Denmark Norway and Iceland also condemned the move. A United Nations spokeswoman said it was a major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security. Small island nations whose existence is threatened by rising sea levels were critical of the move. The President of the Marshall Islands Hilda Heine said it was highly concerning for those of us that live on the frontline of climate change. Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk confirmed that he was leaving his role as an adviser to the Trump administration in protest. Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world he tweeted. President Trump's statement is a very clear repudiation of the Paris agreement and international efforts to fund climate mitigation and adaptation in poorer countries. In many ways it is far worse than many had expected. He sees it as a clear job killer as an economy strangler and a desperately unfair stitch up by other countries wanting to take economic advantage of the US. He spoke of being open to re negotiating the deal or trying to build a new agreement but the idea of re negotiation is an unlikely scenario. The scale of his opposition seeing the deal as a massive redistribution of US wealth to other countries is a clear indication that he has fully bought into an economic nationalist and climate denier perspective. The question of unfairness cropped up again and again how the world's worst polluters China and India had no meaningful obligations placed on them by the deal. The overall tone and content of his speech clearly plays to his base but is also a clear disavowal of multilateralism especially on climate change and will definitely push other countries more closely together on this issue. Climate change or global warming refers to the damaging effect of gases or emissions released from industry and agriculture on the atmosphere. The Paris accord is meant to limit the global rise in temperature attributed to emissions.	True	False	False	True	False
At a Tuesday afternoon event rolling out the new policy Administrator Scott Pruitt invoked a biblical tale from the book of Joshua in which the pagans are instructed to choose this day whom you will serve either God or the gods of your fathers. As it relates to grants from this agency youre going to have to choose said Pruitt who described the new rule as a way of ensuring theres integrity in the process and that the scientists that are advising us are doing so without any kind of appearance of conflict. Pruitt described scientists who received as much as 77 million in grants from the agency while also serving on advisory boards as damaging the perception of independent rule making. Pruitt signed an order cementing the new rules into policy during the 28 minute event with Sen. Jim Inhofe R Okla. and Rep. Lamar Smith R Texas two of the most ardent climate change deniers in Congress at his side. Administrator Pruitt is purging expert scientists from his science boards and replacing them with mouthpieces for big polluters Sen. Tom Udall D N.M. said in a statement. Now instead of independent science guiding the way hired guns for industry will be steering EPA policy on central issues affecting clean air clean water and public health. Pruitt said nothing of industry funded science which has long been used to kneecap regulations. For many scientists working in a time of limited research budgets funding from the EPA or other government agencies is one of the few sources available other than industry money. Wholly unaddressed by the directive is any counterpart prohibition on scientists funded by industries with conflicts of interest from serving as EPA advisors Richard Denison a lead senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund wrote in a blog post. When it comes to advice the agency receives the core concern over the need to avoid conflicts of interest is this Is advice tainted because the entity employing and paying the advisor stands to gain or lose financially from the agency decision that is under advisement? The advisory boards which Congress created as a check on EPA policies and regulations include the EPA Science Advisory Board the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee CASAC and the Board of Scientific Counselors. Pruitt said he plans to announce new members of the boards next week after scientists began quitting the councils in protest earlier this year. While Pruitts new order rejects anyone who receives funding from the agency he has named industry allies to those same boards. As part of the announcement he tapped Michael Honeycutt the head of the Texas Commission on Environmental Qualitys toxicology division to serve as the head of the Science Advisory Board. Honeycutt once suggested the health risks linked to smog were overstated described ozone standards as alarmism that made no biological sense because most people are indoors for 90 percent of the time and blasted the EPA for relying on epidemiological studies that he considered not scientifically rigorous. In 2010 the Texas Observer called him a crony of then Gov. Rick Perry R and accused him of abusing science.Honeycutt relied heavily on research produced by Michael Dourson whose consultancy Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment was described in 2014 by InsideClimate News as the one stop science shop favored by the chemical and tobacco industries. Pruitt picked Dourson to lead the agencys chemical safety division last month. Pruitt also tapped Tony Cox who runs the private consultancy Cox Associates and produces research for major industry groups to lead the CASAC. He has done research on lung disease issues for the American Chemistry Council a trade group for the chemical industry and research on health effects associated with fine particulate matter and ozone for the American Petroleum Institute the oil industrys main lobbying group according to The Intercept. In 2015 he railed against the EPAs plans to tighten rules on ozone emissions. Pruitt appointed Paul Gilman as the head of the Board of Scientific Counselors.Gilman currently serves as the chief sustainability officer at the waste management and incinerator company Covanta.He has been a leading advocate for incinerating trash as a source of fuel for electricity. The trash incinerator industry provides only a tiny fraction of U.S. power but wields outsize influence in some cities and hasattempted to sabotage the U.S. Conference of Mayors effort to push for 100 percent renewable energy. Scott Pruitt doesnt want to listen to a word from anyone who isnt in the pocket of corporate polluters Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said in a statement. For Pruitt anything that helps corporate polluters make money is good and science and facts are just roadblocks he wants to tear down.	True	False	False	True	False
Salvage expert Nick Sloane is the brains behind a scheme to tow a massive iceberg from Antarctica to Cape Town to alleviate the South African city's drought AFP PhotoRODGER BOSCH Cape Town AFP It is a plan as crazy as the situation is desperate towing an iceberg from Antarctica to Cape Town to supply fresh water to a city in the grip of drought. Earlier this year Cape Town came within weeks of shutting off all its taps and forcing residents to queue for water rations at public standpipes. The cut off was narrowly averted as people scrambled to reduce their water usage and Autumn rains saved the day. But the threat is expected to return to the coastal South African city again next year and beyond. The idea sounds crazy admits maverick salvage expert Nick Sloane the brains behind the tow an iceberg scheme. But if you look at the fine details it is not so crazy. Sloane suggests wrapping the iceberg in a textile insulation skirt to stop it melting and using a supertanker and two tugboats to drag it 2000 kilometres 1200 miles towards Cape Town using prevailing ocean currents. The iceberg carefully selected by drones and radiography scans would be about one kilometre in length 500 metres across and up to 250 metres deep with a flat tabletop surface. Melted water could be gathered each day using collection channels and a milling machine to create ice slurry producing 150 million litres of usable water every day for a year. Sloane's idea might be dismissed as mere fantasy. But the 56 year old Zambian South African has a reputation for taking on the impossible after he re floated the giant Costa Concordia cruise ship that capsized in 2012 off the Tuscan island of Giglio killing 32 people one of the world's largest and most complex maritime salvage operations. Icebergs are made of the purest freshwater on earth the founder of Sloane Marine Ltd said earnestly. Thousands break off every year. Mother Nature has been teasing mankind with this for a long time saying 'this is here'. He estimates it would cost 100 million 86 million euros to haul an iceberg on a journey that could take up to three months and another 50 60 million to harvest the water for one year as it melts. In Russia they have pushed icebergs away from oil installations but small ones they are about half a million tons. Here we are talking about 100 million tons said Sloane. To tackle the drought Cape Town has enacted measures ranging from building seawater desalination plants to issuing strict instructions to only flush toilets when necessary. But whether Cape Town authorities will be persuaded to embrace the iceberg project is unclear. At this stage it appears to us that in fact the groundwater or desalination options are cheaper or at least equal cost price said Cape Town's deputy mayor Ian Neilson. There are also questions on how the water from the iceberg will be channelled into the city's distribution system. Another problem is that there is no guarantee that by the time the iceberg is hauled to Cape Town it will still be able to produce the promised volumes of water. Sloane's plan is to tow the giant iceberg some 150 km further north to South Africa's St. Helena Bay where the cold Benguela Current keeps water at around zero degrees Celsius. Once there the iceberg could be anchored in an old submarine channel suggests Sloane. As the iceberg melts water will be collected each day pumped into tankers and driven to Cape Town. It won't sort out Cape Town's crisis but it will be about 20 to 30 percent of their annual needs said Sloane. The project is crazy no question said Olav Orheim a Norwegian glaciologist with four decades of experience who is working on a similar project for Saudi Arabia. Never has such a large iceberg been towed indeed the towing of ice to supply drinking water would be a first and it is unknown if it would withstand ocean currents or simply fracture in transit. But said Orheim it was no longer unrealistic because we know so much more now than when we started this kind of research 40 years ago. It is a high risk project but also one which may have a very high reward at the end said Orheim. For Wolfgang Foerg the chief executive of Swiss company Water Vision which has teamed up with Sloane the project has huge potential in the face of ever more frequent drought. As for Sloane he is ready for the green light. If they tell us to go now we can have it here by Easter 2019 he said.	False	False	False	True	True
Thecreationof the DMZ in 1953 marked a ceasefire in a war that divided Korea and resulted in the deaths of 2.5 million people including more than 36000 American soldiers. With the exception of Panmunjom a small village where peace negotiations were held and is still the site of some diplomatic engagements people are not allowed in the DMZ. Over 60 years have passed since the creation of the DMZ. In that time the inaccessible land between the barbed wire fences has turned into a land of pristine nature and life. It has become a refuge for venous wild flora and fauna with over 106 endangered species including the musk deer mountain goat otter golden eagle mute swan bean good common Korean battering Mongolian racerunner Korean necklace pod and the vesper iris. The DMZ is also a sanctuary for migratory birds visited by rare and wild bird species from all over the world in early October. Smithsonian Magazine reported that before the Korean War much of the wetlands area of the DMZ was cultivated farmland. The Seoul based newspaper the Dong A Ilbo reportedThursday that some experts think the DMZ should be designated a UNESCO biosphere preserved through international support. The World Heritage Committee ambassadors at UNESCO have praised DMZ as a wonderfully preserved natural heritage with potential to be registered as a natural reserve immediately Korean Ambassador to UNESCO Lee Byung hun told the Dong A Ilbo. South Korea applied for registry in 2012 but was thwarted by North Korean opposition according to the Dong A Ilbo. The DMZ is not only home to various wildlife but also to wetlands Kim Kwi gon professor emeritus at Seoul National University told the outlet. The region should be classified according to value such as key areas with high preservation value and buffer areas. Other areas could be designated for economic cooperation and travel. Dong A Ilbo reported that the National Institute of Ecology NIE affiliated by the Ministry of Environment announced on Wednesday that 37.8 percent of the 267 endangered species in Korea are living in the DMZ. The NIE regularly updates Koreans about the state of nature in the DMZ through videos it posts on its social media accounts. The data collected in the DMZ took place from 2014 to 2017. Previous data has been collected starting in 1974.	True	True	False	False	True
For conservatives seeking a major victory a great place to start would be to fix the mess of energy subsidies and regulations that have accumulated over the past eight years. In the years since Barack Obama took office there were 548 billion in energy and environment regulations finalized and the projected budget currently estimates at least 250 billion in federal energy subsidies. Attempts to eliminate these regulations and subsidies have been hampered by conservatives lack of an overarching vision for energy policy. While the Left is happy to use regulation to promote specific forms of energy they find ideologically appealing the response from conservatives all too often has been to weakly offer the all of the above catchphrase as a counterweight. Even worse conservatives sometimes have played the Lefts game in reverse using government to promote their own favored forms of energy rather than to promote competition and markets. For example while criticizing the tax credits for wind and solar power conservatives have embraced subsidies for carbon capture and sequestration and government regulation on nuclear insurance. Conservative principles uphold free markets competition and the rule of law yet too many conservatives are content to get their electricity from regulated monopolies or build infrastructure under outdated regulatory approval processes that take on average 70 months to complete. While conservatives can be bellicose about ending the war on coal they have placed far less emphasis on the benefits of policies to improve liquidity in natural gas markets. Responding to challenges in the energy sphere one issue at a time results in many conservatives missing the forest for the trees and not talking enough about what pro market energy policy looks like. Unwittingly in conservatives quest for equal treatment of different energy sources they have adopted policies that reinforce governments role in dictating energy outcomes. Even when Republicans showed budget discipline in 2015 by finally putting a sunset on several production and investment tax credits they did so without ending all subsidies for wind and solar. The result is entrenched government preference for already mature wind and solar technologies and stymied competition from emerging technologies such as fuel cells and geothermal that would benefit the most from the tax credits. Conservatives sorely need to define an energy narrative rooted in market principles. It should be one that centers on quality institutions and policies that leverage competition and consumer choice. Markets not mandates or subsidies will drive cost reductions innovations and deployment of clean technologies. An incrementalistic approach one that seeks to level the subsidy playing field or merely to pare back Obamas regulatory legacy will do little to foster the conditions needed for the sorts of innovation that both the Right and Left seek. Progressives who favor heavy regulation and energy subsidies had a field day during Obamas presidency. However regulators likely overstated the net benefits of regulations and the Clean Power Plan would have accomplished little at high cost while proving legally vulnerable and politically unstable. An analysis of President Obamas environmental legacy by the American Action Forum found the negative effect of regulations on economic growth led to forgone environmental benefits richer economies tend to value clean air more and emit less relative to production and led to regulations that were about half as effective as claimed on paper. Subsidies also have been inefficient. The National Academy of Sciences found that production and investment tax credits for wind and solar reduced carbon dioxide emissions at a cost of a whopping 250 per ton. A 2015 Congressional Budget Office report acknowledged that tax credits are less effective at achieving policy goals than alternative market driven policies. An AAF analysis of tax credits for renewables found the costs to taxpayers rose at a faster rate than the renewable energy output indicating declining performance of the subsidies. The Lefts focus on energy policy has been costly with poor outcomes. The Democratic party has an official policy to cut pollution from energy use through regulation and subsidies yet another AAF analysis revealed no pathway exists to achieve those stated objectives via regulation. Even assuming the targets were achievable at costs similar to past regulations the economic costs of the regulatory burden would exceed 7 trillion. Conservatives should seek opportunities to shed regulations and subsidies in favor of market oriented policies. This means a plan to phase out distortionary tax preferences completely. Expanding full cost expensing in the tax code would boost RD fairly and efficiently. Additional RD benefits would come from shifting Department of Energy priorities from applied research toward basic research. Opportunities to cut red tape abound from hydroelectric and advanced nuclear licensing to modernizing the Clean Air Act. Removing regulatory barriers to entry for unconventional technologies such as energy storage in wholesale electricity markets would help level the playing field. Rethinking counterproductive energy efficiency regulations which reduce incentives for innovation and risk taking with new technologies should also be a part of the equation. Conservatives should also protect and enhance competitive energy markets. A report from the R Street Institute found that competitive electricity markets cut costs while boosting innovation and environmental quality. Strengthening these markets while minimizing political interventions like power plant bailouts is crucial to the performance of the electricity industry. Improving rules that affect price formation in electricity markets will also help stimulate efficient investments. Conservatives have an opportunity to retake the energy narrative with a platform that favors competition and choice. It would be a return to conservative basics where industries and technologies excel on their merits not political popularity. In so doing conservatives will advance the American economy and their political interests well into the future. Philip Rossetti is a data analyst at the American Action Forum Devin Hartman is electricity policy manager and senior fellow with the R Street Institute.	False	True	True	True	False
Climate Report Warns Of Extreme Weather Displacement Of Millions Without Action Some of the world's top climate scientists have concluded that global warming is likely to reach dangerous levels unless new technologies are developed to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC says pledges from the world's governments to reduce greenhouse gases made in Paris in 2015 aren't enough to keep global warming from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius 2.7 degrees F above pre industrial temperatures. That was the Paris agreement's most ambitious target a 2 degree C rise was established as a more practical goal. But even with a 1.5 degree C increase the world can expect serious changes to weather sea levels agriculture and natural eco systems according to a report issued Monday following an IPCC meeting in South Korea. Limiting warming to 1.5 C is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics says Jim Skea of Imperial College London one of the authors of the report but doing so would require unprecedented changes. Scientists and climate researchers have long doubted that the 1.5 degree C goal was practical or economically feasible. Their new report lays out the difficulty in stark detail it would require a 40 50 percent reduction in emissions by 2030 global emissions are currently rising. It would mean a carbon neutral world one with no net additional greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 2050. They now say that scenario is very unlikely without new measures and technologies to remove greenhouse gases from the air some of which have yet to be invented. We have a monumental task in front of us says co author Natalie Mahowald from Cornell University but it is not impossible. In 50 years she says it's going to be very different. This is our chance to decide what that road will look like. The IPCC report holds out hope that if the global climate warms more than the 1.5 degree or even the 2 degree target this overshoot could be reversed with carbon removal techniques. It suggests numerous ways to take carbon dioxide CO2 the leading greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere. Growing more forests which absorb CO2 is one tactic. But research shows that the amount of land needed for that would be formidable. Another possibility involves burning biomass to make electricity instead of using fossil fuels. Currently about 1 percent of electricity in the U.S. is made that way using things like waste wood and agricultural material. It's expensive however. Crops like corn are now turned into ethanol but that raises food prices. To be economical the biomass would have to be agricultural waste or special crops like switchgrass that don't compete with food crops. There are experimental methods now that can take CO2 directly out of the air after which it could be buried. But billions of tons of CO2 would have to come out and these techniques now cost as much as 1000 to extract a single ton of CO2 according to Howard Herzog an engineer at MIT who specializes in these carbon capture technologies. CO2 is a tiny percentage of the air Herzog likens the technique to removing 400 CO2 marbles from a pile of one million marbles. The best way to remove CO2 from the air he says in his book Carbon Capture is to not release it into the air in the first place. Herzog calls most of these extraction ideas more of a hope than a reality. He says it comes down to cost and it's a lot cheaper to take it out now by reducing emissions than in the future. But most governments now fear the cost of a global overhaul of the world's energy economy in the short time needed to meet the Paris climate goals. As the report concludes There is no simple answer to the questions of whether it is feasible to limit warming to 1.5 C and to adapt to the consequences.... However it does make clear the consequences of warming above that level more heat waves more severe rain and snow events higher sea levels damage to agriculture and displacement of millions of people.

Buildings disappear in the smog in Ulaanbaatar where residents have resorted to sipping 'lung' tea and 'oxygen cocktails' in a desperate bid to protect themselves from pollution Fed up with the smog in Mongolia's capital residents have resorted to sipping lung tea and oxygen cocktails in a desperate bid to protect themselves from pollution despite health officials saying there is no evidence they work. Ulaanbaatar topped New Delhi and Beijing as the world's most polluted capital in 2016 UNICEF said in a report warning of a health crisis that has put every child and pregnancy at risk. With residents of so called ger slum districts using coal stoves to cook and heat their homes in the world's coldest capital where temperatures can dip as low as 40 Celsius 40 Fahrenheit pollution has skyrocketed. While most of the pollution comes from stoves in the gers road transport and power plants add to the toxic mix. On January 30 air pollution was 133 times higher than the safe limit set by the World Health Organization WHO. UNICEF reported that cases of respiratory infections have nearly tripled and pneumonia is now the second leading cause of death for children under five. Worried parents have held protests to press the government to take action. But some businesses are cashing in even though a WHO official says there is no evidence that such anti smog products work. Batbayariin Munguntuul sitting with her children while an air purifier runs at her home in Ulaanbaatar Advertisements in Mongolia boast that drinking just one oxygen cocktail is equal to a three hour walk in a lush forest. At the produce section of the State Department Store blue cans of oxygen called Life Is Air are on sale for 2 and promise to turn a glass of juice into a foamy sweet oxygen cocktail after spraying some into a glass through a special straw. Other stores and pharmacies have oxygen cocktail machines that resemble coffee makers and can turn a juice into a frothy drink for 1. Pregnant women are among the most avid customers of the Russian made product with some saying they are following their doctor's orders. Batbayar Munguntuul a 34 year old accountant and mother of three drank oxygen cocktails when she was pregnant but she ended up spending much more money on medicine. Every winter we constantly buy medicine she told AFP. It has reached a point that it is like just any other grocery product that you have to buy regularly. Like many other Mongolians she has chosen to buy an air purifier to make sure her family breathes clean air at home. Her machine which filters out toxic fumes cost her 300. The average level of PM2.5 particles which penetrate deep into the lungs was 75 micrograms per cubic metre last year or three times the exposure recommended by the WHO for a 24 hour period. Air pollution has been linked to asthma bronchitis and other long term respiratory diseases. Some Mongolians drinking special teas named Enkhjin Ikh Taiga and Dr. Baatar that claim to clean lungs. Dr. Baatar's CEO Baatar Chantsaldulam said sales surge by 20 to 30 percent during winter when pollution tends to reach its peak. First it takes all the toxins out of the blood then it turns the toxins in the lung into mucus and all the plants in tea helps boost the human immune system he told AFP. But Maria Neira the head of the WHO's public health department said the real solution to protect the lungs and the cardiovascular system was to reduce air pollution and avoid exposure to it. The business community will offer plenty of those solutions Neira said referring to the oxygen cocktails and lung teas. We don't have any scientific evidence whether they provide any benefit she said. For the past 10 years people have known that air pollution has reached dangerous levels Parents Against Smog coordinator Tumur Mandakhjargal told AFP. However policymakers only address the issue by talking about passing out clean stoves and clean coal Mandakhjargal said. The NGO says the government should give some 200000 ger residents access to loans so that they install heating insulation and replace their stoves with cleaner heaters. It also complains that a ger relocation plan has been too slow. The government spent 120 million between 2008 2016 to combat pollution with half of the funds coming out of its foreign aid revenue. Part of the money has gone to distributing low emission stoves to residents of ger districts. Last year the parliament approved a tax exemption for companies that sell air purifiers while Prime Minister Ukhnaa Khurelsukh issued an order to distribute 1.6 million worth of the appliances to all schools. Non profit organisations are giving away air purifiers and anti smog masks to schools kindergartens and hospitals. The non profit group Smog and Kids donated a South Korean made air ventilation system to a kindergarten in one of the capital's most polluted areas and the difference in air quality inside and outside the classrooms is palpable. Such systems can cost up to 2500 plus 500 for installation. But Smog and Kids representative Tumendalai Davaadalai said air purifiers were not the answer to the problem. Mobile air purifiers don't give oxygen they're not plants. The decision by Khurelsukh's cabinet to distribute air purifiers is a very bad decision Davaadalai said. They are just funding businesses without any positive results.	True	False	False	False	False
NASA robotic missions to Mars have revealed a world with an amazingly complex history including periods in which it was much warmer with oceans volcanoes and was habitable for many types of simple Earth life. Even now Mars still has abundant subsurface water and organic compounds. NASA is planning a human mission to Mars for the early to mid 2030s and if our history of space exploration is any guide Mars will have many interesting surprises in store for the first humans to set foot there. A human mission to Mars will be complex expensive and very dangerous.Sending humans to Mars and returning them safely to the Earth will be among the most difficult projects ever undertaken. But what should happen after that first step? The most obvious first task in developing an extended presence on Mars is reconnaissance probably carried out with extensive use of miniature drones. It will be essential that we map and evaluate all possible resources that could be useful. These resources will include water whether ice in the top few meters below the surface or liquid water that would exist deeper. Naturally occurring materials such as metals can be used in construction of habitats tools fuel etc. NASAs Mars Curiosity scientists recently announced the discovery of complex organics in the soil. These organic compounds would be essential for hydroponics as Mark Whatley did in wonderful and reasonable accurate movie The Martian. As a side product of growing green planets is that photosynthesis will provide a source of oxygen for breathing. The early Mars colonists will be intently focused upon building safe resilient and sustainable habitats. Whenever humans leave the Earth they must take along a bubble of Earths environment which includes breathable air. Mars has an atmosphere but it is only about 1 percent of the air pressure that exists at sea level on Earth. Furthermore the atmosphere on Mars is almost entirely carbon dioxide CO2. There is only a very tiny amount of oxygen the most important gas that humans need. Fortunately it is relatively straightforward to make oxygen from water and we now know that Mars has abundant water present as a permafrost layer underneath much of the surface. There are several dangers that would face the colonists. These include micrometeorites which burn up in Earths upper atmosphere and ultraviolet radiation from the sun that is blocked by our stratospheric ozone layer on Earth. Mars does not have such an ozone layer. So habitats must be shielded and perhaps built in naturally occurring caves and lava tubes. Imagine an opportunity of building an entirely new world from scratch! As long as the colony is safe and resilient and as long as the resources are available almost anything could be possible. Mars could provide a venue for experimenting with new types of government education societal structures or even recreation. Ultimately once colonies are stable Mars itself could be used as a base for further exploration of the outer solar system. As the early colonists develop a more robust presence they will then be able to devote more effort to establishing further goals. These might include the development of profitable industries for trade with Earth or experimenting with new technologies that might have applications for life on Earth. They could search for life underneath the surface of Martian as has been suggested by the methane plumes that are emitted seasonally from the underground or in the nearby asteroid belt or the moons of Jupiter. Imagine the new types of recreation that might be possible on Mars. Imagine skiing down the slopes of Olumpus Mons the largest extinct volcano in the solar system where the ski slopes are hundreds of miles long. Imagine hang gliding from cliffs six miles high! On Mars the intrepid explorer might delve into caves ancient lava tubes that are hundreds of meters across. Perhaps the most exciting recreation will be exploring that new world. Who knows what we will find there! Michael Summers is a professor of planetary science and astronomy at George Mason University.

Celebrities often claim to be concerned about the environment usually without changing their lavish lifestyles or pollution. During a telethon fundraiser on Sept. 12 for Harvey and Irma relief celebrities like Beyonce linked manmade climate change to the hurricanes. But the very stars participating in the telethon burn massive amounts of carbon dioxide by their extravagant lifestyles just as Daily Mail reported on Sept. 13. The effects of climate change are playing out around the world every day Beyonce claimed in a pre recorded message. But if Beyonce and other celebrities were so concerned about a supposed connection between the devastation and climate change why have they continued to ignore their own carbon gluttony? The A list celebrities who starred in the telethon for those affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma have clocked up hundreds of thousands of air miles which have fuelled rising temperatures and helped create devastating storms Daily Mail foreign reporter Gareth Davies wrote. Climate change activists often claim carbon emissions from driving and flying are a significant cause of man made warming. Davies found that in just the past year Leonardo DiCaprio George Clooney Justin Bieber and Beyonce produced at least 52.11 tons of carbon dioxide with their air travel alone. Biebers jet setting had the highest carbon footprint an egregious 22 tons. In comparison the average Americans total carbon footprint is 20 tons. According to Davies if driving pollution from their concerts or films and the electric in their homes are considered the total was likely to be astronomic. Although DiCaprio is a self proclaimed environmentalist he continued to live an incompatible lifestyle of massive carbon emissions. For the 2017 Oscars DiCaprio and a fellow actor flew an someone 15000 miles round trip to tidy their eyebrows. The actor also asked if are we too late to stop climate change and blasted the supposed corporate greed of the coal oil and gas industries in January 2016. All while owning multiple mansions vacationing on yachts and flying thousands of miles in private jets. Even Forbes noted DiCaprio himself is one of those big polluters which diminishes his moral authority to lecture others on reducing their own carbon emissions in March 2016. Forbes also challenged DiCaprios claim that he only produces 11 tons of carbon annually. Clooney criticized global warming skeptics as stupid and ridiculous in 2013. Despite his rhetoric on climate change however the actor and his wife Amal owned eight homes as of March 2016 according to the Daily Mail. Other celebrities like Julia Roberts are also eco hypocrites. In 2011 she co wrote a USA Today op ed demanding cleaner cooking stoves in third world countries to combat climate change. Yet she has owned five homes and a private jet all at the same time. More than 45 celebrities took part in the fundraiser which brought in more than 44 million. All of the celebrities most likely live far more lavish carbon burning lives than average Americans.	True	False	False	True	False
President Donald Trump is making good on his campaign promise to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement a move thats been called a moral disgrace and thats expected to hinder much needed progress in the fight against global warming. A failure to tackle climate change will mean more extreme weather dirtier air and water and more food shortages. Itll also mean more disease. Researchers have long been arguing that the effects of climate change could undermine the last 50 years of gains in global health increasing the spread of infections like yellow fever and chronic diseases like asthma and heart disease. Now is not the time to be scaling back efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The December 2015 agreement which has been signed by nearly 200 countries aimed to cut greenhouse gas emissions and keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. The US had committed to cutting its emissions by up to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. These goals were widely viewed as a win for public health. Americas retreat now could be a major setback. There are a number of ways climate change puts us at a greater risk for disease. Chief among them a warmer planet is one thats more hospitable to disease. Disease carrying vectors like mosquitoes thrive in warm and moist environments. Zika dengue and chikungunya are all spread by the Aedes type mosquito. And one of the reasons researchers think Aedes may be reaching new places and more people lately is climate change. Its not just mosquitoes though Bird flu cholera Lyme disease salmonella researchers believe all are being made worse by climate change. At a February meeting on climate change and health former Vice President Al Gore focused his talk on this problem. Climate change is tilting the balance disrupting natural ecosystems and giving more of an advantage to microbes he said. Changing climate conditions change the areas in which these diseases can take root and become endemic. Read Maryn McKennas New York Times story for more on this. In addition deforestation and urbanization are moving humans into areas where they havent lived before and putting them into closer contact with animals that carry disease causing microbes like bats during West Africas 2014 Ebola outbreak. Brian Deese a senior adviser to President Barack Obama overseeing climate change and energy policy and former Ebola czar Ron Klain explained why in a piece at the Washington Post Climate change destroys habitats and stresses animal populations such as the bats of West Africa forcing them to hunt for food nearer to humans. Humans likewise pressed by climate impacts encroach more closely on animal habitats. While we cannot know that climate change was the cause of the specific interaction between bats and humans that is believed to have launched the Ebola outbreak in Guinea we will see more of these interactions in the future and more epidemics as a result. Ebola demonstrates that even localized dislocation of people and animals can create global risk. Climate change is a threat multiplier for much broader dislocation accelerating the complex factors that drive people from their homes. Greenhouse gases are not only harmful to the environment they also increase the risk of everything from asthma to heart disease. According to the Global Burden of Disease project more than 5 million people die worldwide each year because of air pollution and emissions from coal fired plants are a major risk factor here. Its one reason why health experts have been pushing policymakers to rapidly phase out of coal. For miners the immediate health risks include black lung disease and scarring of the lung tissue. But the pollutants emitted when coal is processed including sulfur dioxide particulate matter nitrogen oxides and mercury have much more far reaching effects on many more people. In one large study involving 450000 Americans followed between 1982 and 2004 researchers found that increased exposure to the particles in fossil fuel emissions increased the risk of death from heart disease and particles from coal burning were five times more damaging than other similar particles. Reducing emissions from coal fired power plants makes it easier to breathe. Over the past 30 years the percentage of Americans with asthma has more than doubled and climate change has been a significant driver of that trend. Air pollution triggers asthma attacks contributing to lung abnormalities particularly in the developing pulmonary systems of children. The Paris agreement was no panacea but it nudged the world in the right direction. Now the US moves backward. Its not just the future of the environment thats at stake here. Our health hangs in the balance too.	True	False	False	True	False
During an interview with CBC the new US ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft claimed she believes both sides of climate science. Asked Do you believe in climate change? Craft responded I believe there are scientists on both sides that are accurate. Do you believe there is science that proves that man is not causing climate change? the interviewer followed up. Well I think that both sides have you know their own results from their studies and I appreciate and respect both sides of the science Craft said. Though several members of the Trump administration including President Trump himself continue to cast doubt on humans role in the changing climate without providing any evidence its simply not a matter on which scientists disagree at all. The latest National Climate Assessment written by more than 300 scientists at 13 US federal agencies including the Department of Defense and NASA for instance opens with the statement Earths climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization primarily as a result of human activities. The report goes on to detail the toll climate change has already taken on health quality of life and the economy of the US and how those impacts will mount if emissions are not dramatically reduced in the coming years. With continued growth in emissions at historic rates annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century more than the current gross domestic product GDP of many U.S. states according to the assessment. The Trump administration released the report ahead of schedule on the Friday after Thanksgiving a move many interpreted as an attempt to bury the findings. The facts of climate science and the urgency of the climate threat to the US are a nuisance to an administration that has consistently prioritized the demands of the fossil fuel industry to roll back federal policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. And Trump has appointed a number of officials like Craft whose allegiance to industry is clear. In 2016 Craft reportedly donated 265400 toward Trumps election and 17000 to the Republican National Committee. Crafts husband Joseph Craft is a billionaire coal magnate. A Global News report from 2017 provides some details about him While the Crafts have a personal financial stake in pushing climate denialism other prominent Republicans have tried to tamp down on the conclusions of the Climate Assessment by citing concerns about the impact curbing greenhouse gas emissions would have on industry and jobs. But as Voxs David Roberts has detailed there is no consistent evidence that environmental regulations cause long term changes in overall employment.	True	True	False	True	True
As the Trump White House continues its cleanup of the mess foreign and domestic left behind by the Obama administration it should toss out a little noticed document that entangles the U.S. in some of the worst schemes ever cooked up by U.N. bureaucrats and their cronies in the global environmental movement. On September 16 2016 the Obama EPA entered into a memorandum of understanding MOU with the United Nations Environmental Programme UNEP. Concluded just a few weeks before the 2016 presidential election the MOU bears the signature for the U.S. of then EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. In the document UNEP and the Obama EPA vow to consolidate further develop and intensify their cooperation and effectiveness to achieve their common goals and objectives in the field of the environment. And therein lies the problem. For the common goals and objectives shared by the U.N. body and the Obama administration are specifically crafted to hamstring American fossil fuel energy development promote an assortment of politically fashionable but otherwise uncompetitive green technologies and products and perpetuate the deplorable living conditions in the worlds poorest countries. An Instrument of the Paris Climate Accord The document was signed nine months after the adoption of the U.N. sponsored Paris climate accord and the wording of the MOU leaves little doubt that it was seen as an instrument to underscore Americas commitment to curtail its production and use of energy in the name of combatting climate change. Thus UNEP and the Obama EPA agreed to cooperate on responses to climate change including mitigating greenhouse gas emissions reducing short lived climate forcers and supporting adaptation and resilience to climate change. Taking these and similar steps the MOU says will enable the advance toward green economies and resource efficient societies through collaborative activities to promote and support sustainable consumption and production. In truth green economies are those with taxpayer subsidized and government mandated renewable energy primarily wind and solar. And what constitutes sustainable consumption and production is in the eyes of the beholding bureaucrat empowered either by the administrative regulatory state or by legislation adopted at the behest of deep pocketed special interests. All of this is to be pursued through jointly held symposia seminars workshops study tours collaborative research and development projects exchanges and training programs and other forms of cooperation that strengthen the bonds between UNEP and the U.S. Under the MOU each side is to name a Senior Coordinator to oversee the holding of regular joint meetings on matters of common interest. To make sure the two sides stay in touch such meetings are to take place at least once every six months in accordance with an agenda approved by them in advance of every meeting. The outfit the Obama administration teamed up within the MOU UNEP was founded in 1972 by wealthy Canadian businessman Maurice Strong it is headquartered in Nairobi Kenya and has an office conveniently located in Washington D.C. Strong 19292015 was Under Secretary General of the U.N. when he founded UNEP and was an early advocate for combatting what he said was human induced climate change then known as global warming. In keeping with Strongs vision UNEP has worked closely with the Bonn based United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC. For its part UNFCCC has enthusiastically spread climate alarmism and gone to extraordinary lengths to deny the residents of the worlds poorest access to reliable and affordable electricity and transportation fuel thereby perpetuating their poverty. Given UNEPs pedigree and the Obama administrations unbridled hostility to fossil fuels President Trump should scrap the UNEP EPA MOU. Trump and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt inherited the MOU from their predecessors and are under no obligation to adhere to its content. The White House has already withdrawn from the Paris climate accord and President Trump chose to skip the climate change session at the recent G7 meeting in Quebec. Continued fealty to the Obama era MOU runs counter to the presidents goal of American global energy dominance which is anchored to our abundance of oil natural gas and coal. The ties that bound the UN and the Obama administration should not be allowed to constrain the choices of everyday Americans. Even if the MOU is non binding so too are the commitments all parties agreed to under the Paris climate accord. But recognizing the threat the Paris accord posed to U.S. energy security the Trump White House wisely walked away from it. The UNEP EPA memorandum is little more than an implementation tool of the Paris agreement and should suffer the same fate. Both are part of what is at its core a decidedly anti American agenda.

A Tesla Model 3 is touted as a zero emissions car by government regulators but it actually results in more carbon dioxide than a comparable diesel powered car according to a recent study. When the CO2 emissions from battery production is included electric cars like Teslas are in the best case slightly higher than those of a diesel engine and are otherwise much higher reads a release from the German think tank IFO. Its better read as a warning that new technologies arent a climate change panacea. Recall the false promises about corn and cellulosic ethanol The Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote of the study. RELATED 2020 Democrats Back Plan Thats Already Raising Electricity Prices Driving a Tesla Model 3 in Germany for example is responsible for 156 to 181 grams of CO2 per kilometer compared to just 141 grams per kilometer for a diesel powered Mercedes C220d that includes emissions from producing diesel fuel. IFO looked at electric car production in Germany which is heavily reliant on coal power. Electric car emissions in other countries depend on their energy mix but Germany is the worlds third largest electric car maker. China and the U.S. are the first and second largest electric car producers respectively. China gets 65 percent of its electricity from coal power and the U.S. relies on coal for 27 percent of its electric power. China is also the top battery producing country using coal power to produce batteries for electric vehicles that are then subsidized for being zero emissions. California for example requires automakers to cut greenhouse gas emissions in cars by producing lower emissions vehicles or buying credits from companies like Tesla that make electric vehicles. At the federal level the U.S. gives tax breaks of up to 7500 per electric vehicle. Federal subsidies for Teslas are set to be phased out since the company founded by Elon Musk hit the 200000 vehicle production cap. However Congress is debating whether or not to extend electric car subsidies. Its not just battery production but charging vehicles that emit lots of CO2. Germany gets 35 percent of its electricity from coal fired power plants so charging a Tesla in say Bavaria results in 83 grams of CO2 per kilometer driven. Over the long term hydrogen methane technology offers a further advantage it allows surplus wind and solar power generated during peaks to be stored and these surpluses will see a sharp increase as the share of this renewable energy grows study co author Christoph Buchal professor of physics at the University of Cologne said in a statement. IFO isnt the first research group to conclude electric cars might not reduce carbon dioxide emissions as promised. A study released in 2018 also found driving electric cars might come with higher emissions than diesel vehicles largely because of lithium ion battery production. Likewise a Manhattan Institute study from 2018 also found putting more electric cars on the road would likely increase emissions compared to internal combustion engine vehicles.

An aerial view ofthe Antarctic Peninsulas Larsen C ice shelf. According to NASA IceBridge scientists measured the Larsen C fracture to be about 70 miles long more than 300 feet wide and about a third of a mile deep. Photo John SonntagNASA via AP In the six days before President Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change an enormous crack in an Antarctic ice shelf grew 11 miles according to a report by British Antarctic research group Project MIDAS. The crack which is located in Larson Shelf C leaves only eight miles of ice connecting what could be one of the worlds largest recorded icebergs to Antarctica. When it eventually breaks free from the continent the resulting iceberg will measure 31000 square miles represent 10 percent of the ice shelfs original mass and be larger than the state of Rhode Island. The growth spurt between May 25 and May 31 was the largest they have observed since January Project MIDAS says and the inevitable splintering of Ice Shelf C will drastically alter the landscape of the continent and will make the ice that remains less stable. The group states that although this specific crack was not likely caused by climate change the disintegration of Antarctic ice shelves contributes to rising sea levels that threaten coastal cities. When ice shelves disappear ice can flow faster from the land to the ocean and contribute more quickly to sea level rise Adrian Luckman and Martin OLeary of Project MIDAS wrote in February. Rising sea levels endanger heavily populated cities such as New York San Francisco New Orleans and Miami and are predicted to cause 13.1 million Americans to relocate from coastal areas by 2100. Concern about rising sea levels was one of many factors that inspired the Paris Agreements goal of limiting the rise of global temperatures. Project MIDAS expects the ice shelf to mimic the break up of Larson Ice Shelf B which shattered over a period of two weeks in 2002. The calving event will probably be slow and graceful the scientists of Project MIDAS wrote. The ice is already floating so when the fracture breaks all the way through it will simply start to drift away. The group is unsure exactly when the rapidly growing crack will cause Ice Shelf C to break free from Antarctica but believes that the rift has now reached a region of soft ice and that there is very little holding the ice shelf together.

CNN will host a seven hour marathon of interviews with 10 presidential candidates about climate change on Wednesday beginning at 5 pm Eastern as part of its climate crisis town hall. A live stream of the town hall will air on CNN.com. You can also stream it via CNN apps on iOS Android Apple TV Roku Amazon Fire Chromecast and Android TV. The forum will also be broadcast on SiriusXM Channels 116 454 795 and the Westwood One Radio Network. Here is the format The audience will be composed of selected Democrats independents and stakeholders. No public tickets will be issued. That a major television network would devote so much time to a single issue is a sign of how important climate change has become for Democrats and how successful activists have been in elevating the issue. Climate change has rocketed up the list of concerns for primary voters with some polls showing climate change as the number one issue and other indicating that strong majorities want robust climate action from the White House. Activists groups like the Sunrise Movement have refused to let the Democratic National Committee ignore the issue holding sit ins outside their headquarters to demand a climate debate. The DNC responded that it will not hold a climate change debate for 2020 presidential contenders nor will it allow candidates to attend a third party debate. But CNN and MSNBC have found a loophole in the rules that still permits candidates to attend televised forums and town halls. CNN did not respond to requests for comment. MSNBCs climate forum is scheduled for September 19 and 20. In the past few months candidates have been steadily releasing their own visions for how to limit warming this century. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee who made climate change the centerpiece of his presidential campaign and put out the most comprehensive policy agenda is now out of the race giving other candidates some room to distinguish themselves on the issue. Several candidates including Booker Buttigieg and Harris are issuing new climate plans this week. For the most part the Democratic presidential contenders agree that climate change demands a serious policy response and that the US needs to become carbon neutral by roughly the middle of the century. And indeed many have voiced support for the Green New Deal and most have pledged to refuse donations from the fossil fuel industry. The main differences among the candidates lie in how much political capital they intend to expend on fighting climate change and what they would do with executive authority. The town hall will give them an opportunity to present their plans in greater detail and with more nuance. In the prior two rounds of presidential debates spanning more than eight hours climate change received just 35 minutes of airtime. Much of the discussion was shallow and uninformative partly a consequence of having to split attention across 20 candidates. A forum format with one on one discussions with the candidates could better get at these distinctions forcing candidates to make the affirmative case for their own policies rather than sniping at those from other candidates. On the other hand a candidate in the hot seat wont receive any direct challenges from their opponents. It would behoove the networks to focus their discussion on getting at these subtle differences among the candidates like what executive orders they would sign how high climate change ranks as a priority and what measures would a candidate pursue to ensure a just transition to clean energy. Voxs David Roberts and I have come up with some questions that could serve as starting points. CNNs climate change forum has immense potential to illuminate real differences among the candidates and inform the public about the often weedy details of climate policy. However it remains to be seen if there is an audience with a seven hour attention span for a single issue. And theres always the risk that it could devolve into rote recitals of platitudes. Heres to hoping we learn something new.	False	True	False	True	True
Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke spent the last week targeting environmental groups that have for years opposed activities like logging and thinning to reduce the risks of catastrophic wildfires on federal lands. The former Montana congressman blamed litigation from radical environmentalists who would rather see forests and communities burn than see a logger in the woods in a USA Todayop edpublished Wednesday. Zinke also called out extreme environmentalists in aninterviewwith KCRA that aired Sunday. The day before that Zinke lambasted environmental terrorists groups that have not allowed public access that refuse to allow harvest of timber in aninterviewwith Breitbart Radio. Deadly wildfires have consumed over 1 million acres in West Coast states damaging structures and forcing thousands to flee their homes. The recent death of a firefighter battling the nearly 350000 acre Mendocino Complex Fire brings thedeath tollto six for this season. So whats the point of attacking environmentalists? Zinke is taking the conversation away from global warming and bringing it back to land management including the litigation and environmental laws that keep officials from actively managing the forests. Instead activists focus on global warming arguing human caused warming has expanded wildfire season due to longer hotter drier conditions in the western states. At the same time these groups often oppose efforts to clear forests of debris and dead wood that fuel fires when hot dry weather sets in every year. Ive heard the climate change argument back and forth Zinke told the Sacramento based KCRA. This has nothing to do with climate change. This has to do with active forest management.RELATED Californias Biggest Utility Continues To Blame Global Warming For Wildfires Started By Its Own Power Lines Wildfire experts tend to see land management and urban growth as prime drivers of wildfires. Many experts also see global warming as a factor in the rise of fires but admit the relationship is more complicated than the media lets on. The story cant be a simply that warming is increasing the numbers of wildfires in California because the number of fires is declining. And area burned has not been increasing either University of Washington climate scientist Cliff Masswrotein a recent blog post. In fact the recent National Climate Assessmentspecial reportgave low to medium confidence for a detectable human climate change contribution in the western United States based on existing studies. Most wildfires are caused by humans mostly unintentionally. Sparks from vehicles or equipment power lines arson and cigarettes are some of the ways humans cause massive blazes. Lightning is the cause of wildfires humans dont spark. In California for example humanscaused95 percent of all wildfires with power lines and utility equipment becoming a growing problem. Research also shows that wildfire season has primarily grown from population growth in fire prone areas increasing the chances of a fire causing spark. Environmentalists have obviously not taken kindly to Zinkes remarks but are particularly incensed by his dismissal of global warming as a driver of catastrophic wildfires. Randi Spivak public lands program director at the Center for Biological Diversity said the administration is missing the main issue by being dismissive of climate changes effect on the fires. Climate change creates drought high wind conditions low humidity. Fire creates its own weather Randi Spivak the public lands director at the Center for Biological DiversitytoldThe Hill. You can thin all you want till the cows come home but fire will overtake that Spivak said adding what is misleading is people like Zinke and other people who refuse to talk about climate change and how we need to tackle that. Name calling and finger pointing wont change the truth that climate change is exacerbating wildfiresechoedthe Sierra Clubs Athan Manuel. The long term safety of our communities relies on reducing carbon pollution. Zinke actually did say fire season had gotten longer and temperatures had warmed but added that doesnt relieve you of the responsibility to remove the dead and dying timber and manage our forests so you dont have these catastrophic burns. But Zinke is correct that environmental litigation has kept federal agencies including the Interior Department and U.S. Forest Service from thinning clearing debris and conducting prescribed burns to keep forest growth in check. A 2014studypublished in the Journal of Forestry found vegetative management or logging projects continued to be the dominant type of management activity involved in Forest Service land management litigation representing nearly three times more cases than any other type of management activity. The Forest Service was found more likely to lose cases where plaintiffs advocated for less resource use particularly in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals where the agency won less than half its cases. In fact the 9th Circuit on Mondayoverturneda Forest Service plan for part of Idahos Payette National Forest. The judge sided with environmental groups and ruled renders the Project inconsistent with the desired vegetative conditions set forth in the Payette Forest Plan from 2003. The servicesplanthat got overturned included getting fire conditions toward historical range of variability to reduce wildland fire risk improve wildlife habitat through mechanical thinning harvest and prescribed burning.

As India's north continues to struggle with extreme pollution levels the story has put a fresh spotlight on air quality in cities across Asia. Beijing has long been notorious for its smog but statistics show that India Pakistan and Bangladesh have worse air by far. So why is South Asia so much more polluted? Of the world's most polluted 30 cities 22 are in India according to research by IQ AirVisual a Swiss based group that gathers air quality data globally and Greenpeace. The remaining eight cities are all in Pakistan Bangladesh and China but the list doesn't include Beijing which comes in at number 122. Just looking at global capitals it's also Asian cities that top the ranking. Looking at overall countries it's Bangladesh that has the worst air followed by Pakistan and then India. All these rankings are based on average air quality per year. As these countries have very different densities of measuring stations and transparency of data the statistics have to be read with a degree of caution. But they certainly indicate an overall trend. The fight against air pollution in three global cities Why is India worse off than China? Pollution in urban areas is usually a mix of different factors mostly traffic fossil fuel burning power plants and heavy industries. What differentiates China from India is that in the latter there is still a lot of burning of agricultural stubble when farmers want to clear their fields. The burning usually takes place in autumn. In this episode the big problem really seems to have been the agricultural burning assistant professor Thomas Smith of the London School of Economics told the BBC. That's one thing that China has tackled. All agricultural burning has been banned full stop. A global overview for fires and thermal abnormalities is made available by Nasa and allows users to track developments over past days and weeks. The area north west of Delhi shows a highly unusual concentration of fires Prof Smith points out. And you can't underestimate how important agricultural burning is even though people often think only of cars and heavy industry as the causes. In the wake of the pollution spike India's Supreme Court ordered a stop to stubble burning in the states around Delhi. But the city's situation is made worse by the colder winter air which is more stagnant trapping the pollutants in place. Prof Smith also points out that while India is largely reactive Beijing tends to be more proactive and preventative to try to stop the problems from happening in the first place. What does pollution feel like? Pollution levels are categorised by measuring the levels of dangerous particles in the air. The result is then classified on a scale from good to hazardous. The effect of pollution is different for every person explains Dr Christine Cowie of the University of New South Wales. Some people complain about irritation to the eyes to the throat exacerbations of wheeze and asthma symptoms. Coughing is certainly also a very common symptom even in non asthmatic people. And of course it's the elderly who suffer the very young and people with pre existing respiratory illnesses like or heart problems. She explains that even a short exposure to the unhealthy or worse pollution levels can trigger an asthma attack or increase the risk of a stroke. The longer the exposure the greater the risks. And the ways to protect oneself are limited. There's the advice to stay indoors to reduce physical exercise and to wear a mask but in many poorer parts of the world none of these options really work for regular people. It is toxic air says David Taylor professor of tropical environmental change at the National University of Singapore. It must be very uncomfortable especially if you're having to work outside and if you're having to do jobs that require quite a lot of energy. You feel like it's hard to breathe agrees Prof Smith. It's like doing hardcore exercise when you just take a walk outside. And depending on the kind of pollution you can of course also smell it in the air. How does it compare to Europe or the US? Today pollution levels in Europe Australia and the US are significantly lower than the extreme readings that India has experienced in the past few days. But it's not always been like that. London for instance was notorious for its pollution during much of the 19th and early 20th centuries. As late as 1952 the so called Great Smog covered London with a thick toxic layer of pollution bringing the city almost to a standstill for days not unlike the situation in Delhi now. It's thought to have resulted in thousands of deaths. While London experienced a different mix of pollutants it probably wasn't far off what's currently happening in Delhi says Mr Taylor. Back then power stations along the Thames were major polluters of the British capital. In fact much of what we know today about the health impact of air pollution dates back to the experiences of the London smog during those years.	False	True	False	True	False
Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni visited Assisi Wednesday to commemorate the feast of Italys patron St. Francis in conjunction with the towns announcement it was divesting itself of all oil coal and gas holdings in a gesture aimed against commonly cited causes of manmade global warming. The Franciscan monasterial complex in Assisi the spiritual home of the Franciscan friars throughout the world is among the 40 Catholic institutions and organizations jointly announcing their adherence to an international ecological campaign calling for the disinvestment from all fossil fuels in the hopes of combatting climate change. The Mayor of Assisi Stefania Proietti indicated the citys extensive olive groves as an effective tool for mitigating climate change because of the trees ability to absorb the large quantities of carbon dioxide it needs in order to grow and produce olives. In a world in which the ecological crisis is an external manifestation of the ethical cultural and spiritual crisis of modernity it is necessary to recall the values of custody of creation the preferential option for the poor and the peace that is built in everyday life including with attention to the care of the common home she said. The Assisi diocese joined the dioceses of Caserta and Gubbio in this symbolic gesture along with dozens of other Catholic organizations throughout the world such as the Archdiocese of Cape Town the Belgian bishops conference the German Bank for Church and Caritas. In this new wave of ethical investing the total figure of divestiture for the church groups involved has not been disclosed but is reportedly four times higher than a previous church record. Coordinating these efforts is the World Catholic Climate Change Movement which in January sponsored the first world conference on fossil fuel divestment from a Catholic perspective at Romes Pontifical Lateran University. The moral clarity of these 40 institutions is a source of deep joy said Toms Insua the director of the Movement. Their leadership is launching a path that the World Bank and its financial organs should follow. Considering that the World Bank is meeting these days in Washington we hope its leaders will notice that the fossil free movement has grown and is getting stronger. Christiana Figueres the former UN climate tsar who helped negotiate the Paris climate accord lauded the move as a further sign we are on the way to achieving our collective mission. I hope we will see more leaders like these 40 Catholic institutions commit because while this decision makes smart financial sense acting collectively to deliver a better future for everybody is also our moral imperative she said. Earlier this year Pope Francis momentarily departed from his denunciation of fossil fuels offering a large donation of tons of cost effective fuel briquettes to heat the homes of internally displaced persons IDPs in Ukraine. As part of the Pope for Ukraine initiative Francisdonatedmore than 2.5 tons of fuel per displaced family cared for by the parish of the Holy Theotokos in the village of Vilcha. The combustible fuel briquettes reportedly were sufficient to heat the homes and apartments of more than a hundred resettled families throughout the heating season and into the coming winter as well. The politically incorrect gift highlighted thecost effectivenessand ready availability of fossil fuels which were responsible for powering the industrial revolution throughout the developed world. Pope Francis has been a vocal advocate of clean renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions. His groundbreaking 2015 encyclicalletterLaudato Sion care for the environment was the first teaching letter of its sort in the history of the Catholic Church. In that text Francis wrote of an urgent need to take steps leading to the substitution of fossil fuels with alternative energy sources.	False	False	False	False	False
Investigators are looking into the Hanford nuclear facility in Washington state after contractors were filmed dumping radiation affected water and later tried to bury the evidence at the site of one of the largest nuclear cleanup efforts in the world. Several videos obtained by Seattles KING TV show workers at the Hanford facilitys Plutonium Finishing Plant PFP dumping liquids from large metal containers that are labeled Caution radioactive materials. In nearly 25 years of working here Ive never seen anything like that a Hanford worker told KING. The workers are employed by Washington River Protection Solutions WRPS the organization responsible for cleaning approximately 53 million gallons of high level radioactive and chemical waste stored in the containers at Hanford. The facility dates back to the Manhattan Project in the 1940s. For decades it produced the majority of the plutonium for the US nuclear weapons arsenal. In 1988 production stopped and the site became a burying ground for radioactive waste. Hanford has since become the most contaminated spot in the Western Hemisphere prompting a multi billion dollar clean up process that isnt expected to be completed until 2060. The soils under Hanford are extensively contaminated over a broad broad area. The one thing you dont want to do is create more waste sites said Dirk Dunning a chemical engineer and Hanford expert. WRPS told state investigators that workers dumped around 15 gallons of potentially toxic water on August 15 and 200 gallons on August 17 according to a document from the Department of Ecology. Washington law makes it a gross misdemeanor to discharge pollutants into the water or soil. The company was also required to report any discharge of toxic waste to the Department of Ecology within 24 hours. However WRPS did not report the discharges for nearly a month and a notification from the Department of Ecology shows the company only made the report days after KING emailed WRPS federal and state officials and the Environmental Crimes Unit of the state Office of the Attorney General about the incident. They knew it was wrong to dump the liquids but they did it anyway. They were hoping no one would question it. They definitely knew it should have been reported a WRPS employee said. WRPS had been tasked with digging up 18 underground nuclear waste hoses and putting them in containers which would then be buried in a nuclear waste dump at the facility. When workers found one of their containers filled with rainwater they decided to dump it onto the ground rather than testing the water or transferring it to new containers. A contract shows the company would earn 58333 for each hose that was removed for a total of more than 1 million dollars if they finished the project by September 30. WRPS dumped the toxic liquid in order to meet their deadline said Tom Carpenter executive director at Hanford Challenge a watchdog organization working to keep contractors working at the facility accountable. They are here for the money and thats it Carpenter told KING. This fee structure ignores human nature which is to take shortcuts to get the money without any accountability unless they get caught. The Department of Ecology has launched an investigation and has already been to the site to take soil samples to check for chemicals such as arsenic lead and fluorene at the first dumping site. However after WRPS did a radiological survey and identified beta and gamma radioactive contamination they removed the contaminated soil and surrounding debris which can no longer be tested by investigators. The disposal of radioactive waste at Hanford has been plagued with problems. RT visited the site last year after workers were evacuated from the facility due to a leak of thousands of gallons of toxic waste. Locals said that the site occasionally burps radiation which has led to a number of employees developing serious medical conditions over the years. In August the company tested more than 300 workers and found 20 percent tested positive for radiation contamination. The Department of Energy estimates that 444 billion gallons of radioactive material and chemical waste were discharged onto the grounds of the facility and into the Columbia River in the first 50 years since the facility opened. Dumping at the site without a permit became illegal after the nonprofit advocacy group Heart of America Northwest sued the Department of Energy in 1993. After seeing the recent footage of workers dumping the toxic waste at the site state Representative Gerry Pollet who also serves as the executive director of Heart of America Northwest called their actions outrageous. This is the kind of thing that caused Hanford to be the most contaminated place in the Western Hemisphere in the first place. I am shocked to see something like this in 2017 Pollet said. Its a crime. Im convinced by looking at this that youre witnessing a criminal violation of several statues not just one.	True	True	False	False	True
Joe Biden has been roundly mocked on Twitter after making the unlikely claim to a young activist appealing for a presidential debate on climate change that he kicked off the whole global warming movement back in the late 1980s. A young activist from US Youth Climate Strike asked Biden if he would support a presidential climate policy forum organized by the group. Biden interrupted the girl before she was finished asking By the way did you know Im the guy who did all this? Read Real Clear Politics it will tell you about how I started this whole thing back in 1987 climate change. Social media users were quick to criticize Bidens response with some mocking him for saying he had started climate change and others pointing out that his 1987 effort didnt really work out so well. Biden has repeatedly boasted of his 80s climate change concern telling voters he was the first to introduce a climate bill. In 1987 Biden delivered a Senate speech warning of the dangers of global warming and his Global Climate Protection Act called for setting up a task force to plan to tackle the issue. While he is the first to have a climate bill passed he certainly isnt the first politician to raise the alarm about climate change let alone have started the whole thing. Congressman Al Gore held House hearings on climate change in 1976 and as a senator introduced a resolution calling for a research program into greenhouse gas emissions in 1985. The following year Republican Senator John Chafee held Senate climate hearings warning of the serious problem and featuring an expert explaining that significant warming could happen within 5 15 years. Biden has been criticized for reportedly planning a middle ground approach to climate policy that is accused of lacking urgency and not going far enough. Think your friends would be interested?

Climate change garners most of the headlines but the Trump administration is pushing a much larger and broader pro pollution agenda whose latest manifestation is a push at the EPA to overturn a long established scientific consensus that fine particulate pollution colloquially soot kills people. This is critically important for two main reasons. One is that for decades the EPA has been regulating various sources of particulate emissions and the science around how harmful they are plays a role in driving how strict those regulations become. The other is that particulate emissions play a key role in the bureaucratic politics of climate change. Because carbon dioxide emissions are global and the consequences of climate change are also global it is generally hard to demonstrate that cutting a given source of greenhouse gas emissions will have large benefits to Americans. But most regulations that reduce carbon emissions also reduce much more localized soot and taking into account the fact that soot has a marked tendency to kill people who live nearby the emissions sources is important to making the cost benefit analysis math work. Tony Cox an industry consultant Trump tapped to lead the EPAs Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee argues that the EPAs agencys current standards for evaluating this question does not feature enough causal rigor. He wants to abandon the current weight of the evidence standards that allows for a wide range of evidence to be considered with credibility weighted according to the quality of study design in favor of a very narrow class of studies that employ manipulative causation methods. But as Francesca Dominici a biostatistician at Harvards T.H. Chan School of Public Health writes with researcher Gretchen Goldman in a new Science essay on the subject this loads the dice against demonstrating harms because randomized control trials are not possible or ethical when studying environmental hazards. In other words you cant get a group of volunteers together and then randomly assign half of them to have the air they breathe be deliberately poisoned just to see how bad the poison is. You have to rely on ways of exploiting random variation through methods like observational data time series and quasi experiments. Its true of course that you dont want to do a completely naive associational study and then leap to big policy conclusions from it. But public health researchers are aware of the limits of the data available and use matching statistical controls and other standard techniques to try to get a clearer picture of whats going on. Barring all that evidence would as Dominic writes place a nearly unattainable burden of proof on the scientific community and totally undermine the EPAs legal mandate to protect vulnerable people. Both the public health research and the EPA debate are largely focused on the question of soots ability to kill people through e.g. asthma but theres a big emerging set of empirical economics studies suggesting that fine particulates have a wider range of adverse cognitive impacts and are significantly underrated. In other words the consequences of rolling back the war on soot could be substantially worse than the mortality impacts alone imply. Economists like public health researchers are limited by their inability to deliberately poison people in order to study the impact of the poisoning. Consequently none of the studies Ive read on particulate pollution and cognitive impairment quite reaches gold standard levels of scientific evidence. But there are instead lots of quasi experiments and statistical matching studies and they all find that air pollution is worse than we thought. In addition to killing small numbers of people air pollution harms large numbers of people in small but meaningful ways This is an emerging field of study and it would obviously benefit from some further inquiry. That said it appears to be the case that fine particulate pollution induces cognitive impairments in school children white collar workers blue collar workers and the elderly in other words all people at all stages of life. Each of these impacts independently suggests that we are currently allowing too much air pollution and they also cry out for more research that attempts to assess the long term cumulative impact of pollutants that appear to induce cognitive problems throughout the life cycle. The question of exactly how much we are under regulating particulates seems somewhat open to me but the sign of the error is very clear.	True	False	False	False	True
A mid spring snowstorm in Colorado over the weekend postponed a rally that sought to bring attention climate change and global warming as well as protest President Donald Trumps climate policies. A march slated to take place in Colorado Springs on Saturday had to be cancelled after weather forecasters predicted heavy snowfall and blizzard like conditions. Only a few inches of snow fell in the Colorado Springs area but more than a foot of snow fell on other parts of the state. Sometimes Mother Nature throws you a curveball! We know we arent in the business of risking anyones safety. Dangerous conditions and wet heavy snow in the forecast for tomorrow a local climate change organization wrote on their Facebook page. The rally and march was rescheduled for Sunday afternoon. The freezing weather and snow however was unable to postpone a similar rally in Denver where pictures of a snowman at the global warming rally made rounds on Twitter. As well as an ironic sign In other parts of the country where similar marches and rallies took place the weather was a little kinder to the liberal climate alarmist narrative. In Washington D.C. the temperature was in the upper 80s to near 90 as people gathered to protest Trumps climate policies. The Peoples Climate March which was supported by hundreds of thousands across the country and tens of thousands in Washington was sponsored by environmental groups labor unions and social justice groups. Video showed thousands marching in the streets of Washington where former Vice President Al Gore Hollywood superstar Leonardo DiCaprio and Virgin Atlantic owner Richard Branson showed up to protest as well. This weekends protests come one week after last weeks March for Science.	True	False	False	True	True
Reuters Hurricane Irma will pose the toughest test yet for U.S. nuclear power plants since reactors strengthened their defenses against natural disasters following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. Irma was on course to hit South Florida early on Sunday after slamming Cuba as a Category 5 storm. It weakened to a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 130 miles per hour 210 km per hour on Saturday but was expected to strengthen before reaching Florida bringing a storm surge to a state home to four coastal nuclear reactors. The National Hurricane Centers forecast track shows Irma making landfall on the southwest side of the Florida Peninsula west of the two nuclear reactors at the Turkey Point plant. The operator Florida Power Light FPL has said it will shut Turkey Point well before hurricane strength winds reach the plant. The reactors are about 30 miles 42 kilometers south of Miami. FPL said it will also shut the other nuclear plant in Florida at St Lucie which also has two reactors on a barrier island on the states east coast about 120 miles 193 km north of Miami. We will shut the reactors down 24 hours before Category 1 force winds are forecast to hit FPL Chief Executive Eric Silagy told a news conference. FPL said both Turkey Point and St Lucie were designed to withstand storms stronger than any ever recorded in the region and both plants are elevated 20 feet 6 meters above sea level to protect against flooding and extreme storm surges. But South Miami Mayor Philip Stoddard said he was concerned about the potential for floods to damage power generators at Turkey Point which in turn might threaten the ability of the plant to keep spent nuclear fuel rods cool. At Fukushima in Japan an earthquake and tsunami disrupted power supplies and caused the fuel in some units to meltdown. The whole site is pretty well able to handle dangerous wind the real problem from my perspective is water Stoddard said. He said he was more worried about the nuclear waste than the reactors. The real question is can they keep the spent fuel cool. Peter Robbins an FPL spokesman said Mayor Stoddard is wrong. Turkey Point is safe and is ready for Hurricane Irma. U.S. nuclear operators have taken steps to improve preparations for disasters since Fukushima. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC required plants to install portable pumps and generators to keep water moving over fuel rods and the spent fuel pool even if offsite power supply was lost. Nuclear plants also hired more staff and stored equipment needed to deal with reactor problems. Things are better today than in March 2011. Time will tell whether better proves good enough said Dave Lochbaum director of a watchdog group the nuclear safety project at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The NRC said it was posting more inspectors at the two Florida plants and was considering sending more inspectors to plants in Georgia and South Carolina should the storm head that way. The NRC said the plants should not be compromised by Irmas storm surge. The storm surge forecasts that we have seen so far do not challenge the sites designs said NRC spokesman Scott Burnell. Both Florida plants have previously weathered major storms. Turkey Point took a hit from Hurricane Andrew a Category 5 storm in 1992 damaging a smokestack at fossil fuel plant at the site. Repairs cost about 90 million. St Lucie withstood the back to back impact of Hurricanes Frances Category 2 and Jeanne Category 3 in 2004. FPL shut St Lucie last October as Hurricane Matthew skirted the Florida coast. Lochbaum said the NRC and the industry could do more to reduce vulnerability to flooding. In January 2014 about 50000 gallons of rainwater leaked into the St Lucie plant after a heavy downpour. An NRC study blamed degraded and missing flood seals that were not discovered during checks after Fukushima. There is also spent nuclear fuel at the site of a third power plant in Florida which stopped operating in 2009. That is the Crystal River plant owned by Duke Energy Corp. Duke is in the process of transferring used fuel from the spent fuel pool at the plant to dry cask storage as part of work to decommission the plant. Once in storage the fuel no longer needs cooling. The NRCs Burnell said Duke has suspended work to transfer the rods ahead of Irma. He said the fuel was safe and the plant also has backup power even though it has been shut for years. Irma is expected to disrupt much of Floridas power supply. FPL the states largest electric company has warned Irma could cut service to about 4.1 million of its nearly 5 million customers. FPL is one of four large publicly traded utilities in Florida. Other natural disasters since Fukushima have shut some plants. An earthquake in Virginia in 2011 shut Dominion Energy Incs North Anna plant for about 2 12 months the time it took to complete a full damage inspection. That plant sustained no major damage. Hurricane Sandy in 2012 caused three reactors in the U.S. Northeast to shut but inflicted no serious damage.	False	False	False	True	True
In his first year as head of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt has made a huge mark shrinking his agency and repealing as many Obama era environmental regulations as possible. And as I pointed out last month in this feature story hes also overseen a drastic slowdown in the day to day work of the agency. Key offices remain vacant and the implementation of new environmental rules has stalled effectively throttling the agency. But one of EPAs most important jobs is to enforce civil penalties for companies that breach limits for hazardous chemicals like sulfur dioxide and hydrochloric acid. And one new measure of Pruitts foot dragging thats just emerged is how much money EPA has been collecting from polluters lately. According to a new report from the Environmental Integrity Project a watchdog group that advocates for enforcement of environmental laws the amount of fines collected by Trumps EPA has plummeted compared to the agency under the past three presidents in their first year in office. Check out this chart The fines come from consent decrees a type of legal settlement where a party has to take a specific action but does not have to admit fault or liability. The consent decrees here involve violations of federal environmental laws like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. This tally doesnt include penalties from EPAs Superfund program criminal cases or the administrative actions that EPA takes to resolve smaller violations. The number of civil cases filed by the EPA to collect these fines in the first place has also declined. In President Clintons first year there were 73 under Bush 112 under Obama 71. In 2017 there were just 48 cases. What this means is that the EPA is not going after polluters like it used to. Less enforcement doesnt mean there arent a whole lot of violations that are out there said Eric Schaeffer executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project who led the civil enforcement office at the EPA under Presidents Clinton and Bush in a call with reporters. He noted that many of these civil cases take months to complete so some of the cases completed under Trump started under Obama. In a consent decree reached with Exxon Mobil last October the EPA boasted that the company would spend 300 million to install pollution controls but Schaeffer noted that this total includes measures installed as far back as 2013. And its likely enforcement will decline further for ongoing environmental investigations. Many of those cases will drop out of sight if Congress agrees to cut the agencys enforcement budget by 17 percent as President Trump has proposed according to the report. Enforcement matters especially to the people who live and work next to plants that continue to release more pollution than the law allows. The EPA did not respond to a request for comment.

Britishtaxpayers face paying more to help developing countries tackle climate change after Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris agreement left a 2.3billion black hole. The US President pulled the plug on billions of dollars his country pledged as part of a 78billion international commitment to help poor countries switch to renewable energy. And now other rich nations including the UK could be called on to cover the cost. International Development Secretary Priti Patel yesterday indicated she would be reluctant to plug the financial gap left by Mr Trump's decision to pull out. She stressed the importance of the fund in heading off wider humanitarian crises such as droughts and floods and said leaders should focus on cutting waste from the programme rather than pumping in more cash immediately. Asked whether the UK could contribute more she told the Daily Mail 'It is not always about money it is about ways of working and how to achieve effective outcomes. 'I think we can work more effectively in making sure that every pound that goes in to the fund is achieving what it is meant to do.' Mr Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris agreement was met with dismay around the world yesterday. China and Europe pledged to unite to save 'Mother Earth' as others including the UK and Russia reaffirmed their commitment to the international accord. A key part of the 2015 Paris deal signed by more than 190 nations was a commitment from the richest nations to contribute 78billion a year to the Green Climate Fund to help poorer countries tackle global warming. The UK has promised 720million money that comes from the foreign aid budget and private investors. Former president Barack Obama had pledged 2.3billion from the US. The Paris Climate Agreement commits nations to reduce carbon emissions to stop the world overheating. But Mr Trump who previously dismissed climate change as a 'Chinese hoax' wants to renegotiate terms that are 'fairer' to the US. In a Press conference after a summit between the EU and China European Council president Donald Tusk said the bloc was stepping up co operation with China on climate change. 'Today China and Europe have demonstrated solidarity with future generations and responsibility for the planet' he said. Russia said it was still likely to back the Paris pact although a Kremlin spokesman said Washington's withdrawal had punched a gaping hole in the agreement because the US was one of the biggest generators of emissions. Coal crazy China tries to improve its image Chinahas stepped forward to replace the US as a world leader on climate change. Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord will bolster China's global stature and help it profit from renewable energy investment an expert predicts. That is despite China being the top emitter of greenhouse gases and by far the world's largest consumer of coal. In a joint statement yesterday the EU and China said action on climate change was 'more important than ever' and both committed to 'significantly intensify' their efforts. Nick Mabey of the climate change think tank E3G said it was the 'strongest bilateral statement on climate' he had seen adding 'President Trump has driven the EU and China together to write the rules for the clean economy.' Coal still accounted for 62 per cent of China's total energy consumption in 2016. In January it suspended or cancelled plans to build another 100 coal fueled power plants. But dozens more are still expected to be built. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sought to ward off criticism by saying the US would continue trying to curb greenhouse emissions despite pulling out of the Paris accord. But French President Emmanuel Macron turned Mr Trump's 'Make America Great Again' campaign slogan on its head saying that it was time to 'make the planet great again'. Prime Minister Theresa May told Mr Trump of her 'disappointment' at his decision in a phone call with the President shortly after his announcement on Thursday. But she was criticised by Labour for failing to add her name to a joint statement issued by European leaders to say that the Paris climate accord cannot be renegotiated as Mr Trump has demanded. Jeremy Corbyn said 'Given the chance to present a united front from our international partners she Mrs May has instead opted for silence and once again subservience to Donald Trump. It's a dereliction of both her duty to this country and our duty to our planet.' Gareth Redmond King head of climate and energy at the World Wide Fund for Nature said investment in renewable energy was a great business opportunity. 'We're calling on the next UK government to step up as a global leader on tackling climate change' he said. 'It is what the public wants it makes economic sense and it is what the world needs in order to safeguard the lives of future generations.'	True	False	False	False	False
In the last year alone California has seen catastrophic wildfires burn thousands of acres. On Tuesday the ongoing Camp Fire in Northern California became the state's deadliest blaze in history. How do these deadly fires start and why is California so susceptible? Officials define wildfires or wildland fires as any fire occurring on undeveloped land. Forest fires are uncontrolled wildfires burning in lands covered at least in part by timber or flammable vegetation. In nature two things can spark wildfires lava and lightning. According to the National Park Service 90 of wildfires in the US are caused by humans whether by unattended campfires burning debris cigarettes or arson. About 2 of California's 2816 wildfires in 2016 were caused by lightning according to data from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Cal Fire. The majority could be attributed to humans though only 8 were caused by arson. According to Prof David Peterson of the University of Washington a former senior researcher with the US Forest Service fires in the region have not necessarily increased in frequency in the last 100 years but the area affected has. The area burned annually has been higher during the past 30 years or so he told the BBC. It should be noted that 2 of fires burn 98 of the area. In California recent years have seen a combination of extremely high temperatures strong winds a long drought and population growth causing lethal fast moving blazes. Last year the state had over 9500 wildfires that burned over a million acres according to the National Interagency Fire Center and had the highest number of homes and buildings lost in one state. And straying away from natural burning cycles has also contributed to the lethality of recent fires Prof Peterson says. Keeping fires from starting in Western forests has caused fuel to accumulate far beyond historical levels. Therefore when fires occur they can burn hotter he says. These high intensity fires can cause rapid and in some cases long term changes in vegetation making it more difficult for the ecosystem to recover. Once evacuation orders are issued by local law enforcement residents generally have hours to leave Cal Fire information officer Kathleen Schori told the BBC. But in those initial stages of fire you may have minutes she added. Fleeing in a vehicle is ideal as most wildfires cannot be outrun. But the Camp Fire's especially rapid spread fuelled by high winds made the situation even more dangerous. This fire moved so fast I don't think anybody did anything wrong Ms Schori says when asked whether those forced to abandon vehicles and escape on foot could have acted differently. During the initial phases it was burning 80 miles in an hour. She stressed the importance of following evacuation orders immediately especially with fast moving blazes. If you don't evacuate and it becomes a rescue situation then our firefighters are taken away from the firefight and moved to the rescue. Sometimes you do fight fire with fire. In addition to old fashioned water and flame retardant delivered from ground level and above the flames by aircraft sometimes firefighters have to burn more to quell the flames. Intentionally burning areas around a wildfire can help starve the blaze and control its direction. Clearing out brush and flammable material from an area to create firebreaks is another way to achieve the same. Ninety eight percent of fires are small andor suppressed quickly Prof Peterson says. The other 2 are very challenging when they get large and are almost impossible to put out at least until it rains. Ms Schori of Cal Fire said that with wind driven blazes like the Camp Fire officials often have no choice but to wait for conditions to improve. There are never enough firefighters to combat a fire that's moving as fast as this was moving she says. You have to deploy your resources on each side of the fire and continue to construct lines. And when that wind stops then you can safely get in front it. Prof Peterson says there is no hard evidence that climate change has affected US wildfires yet. We expect that there will be significant effects in future decades as the climate continues to warm he told the BBC. A warming climate Prof Peterson explained would increase the duration of the fire season and more droughts would in turn create more wildfire fuel. Globally the length of the wildfire season has already increased by nearly 19 between 1978 and 2013. By around 2050 fires may burn two to three times more area than they have historically. According to 2017 data from Verisk Analytics 4.5 million US homes were in areas of high or extreme wildfire risk and over 2 million of those homes were in California. Damage caused by wildfires has cost 5.1bn in the last decade Verisk found. In California homeowners who do not qualify for private insurance coverage can opt into a statewide pool called the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements FAIR plan. FAIR is comprised of all property and casualty insurers in California and is not run by a state agency.	False	False	True	True	False
President Donald Trump's eldest son Don Jr. has criticized Time magazine for naming Greta Person of the Year 2019 in a mocking tweet. The businessman denounced the choice as a 'marketing gimmick' and said the prize should have honored 'Hong Kong Protesters fighting for their lives and freedoms' his father was also a finalist. Tweeting yesterday in response to Time magazine he wrote 'Time leaves out the Hong Kong Protesters fighting for their lives and freedoms to push a teen being used as a marketing gimmick.' The 16 year old Swedish face of climate activism made headlines after shouting 'How dare you?' at world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly earlier this year accusing them of failing the younger generation. An image of her stare at Donald Trump as he entered the UN quickly became a social media meme. Miss Thunberg was up against four other Time's finalists including anti government Hong Kong protesters U.S. house speaker Nancy Pelosi the anonymous whistleblower who revealed Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July that may lead to his impeachment and in ironically also Donald Trump. The young activist attracted international attention after holding a sign that said 'skolstrejk fr klimatet' or 'School strike for the climate' in Swedish parliament last year. The activist has drawn increasingly large crowds with her appearances at protests and conferences over the past year and a half. Veteran campaigners and scientists have welcomed her activism including her combative speeches challenging world leaders to do more to stop global warming. Time editor in chief Edward Felsenthal told the Today show 'She became the biggest voice on the biggest issue facing the planet this year coming from essentially nowhere to lead a worldwide movement.' He confirmed she is the magazine's youngest ever choice. Malala Yousafzai was runner up in 2012 losing out to Barack Obama aged 15. U.S. president last month signed legislation backing the Hong Kong protesters in their fight for democracy which could be the reason for his son's backing. The protests begun in March when an extradition bill now suspended called for those facing trials to be sent to mainland China which was seen as a threat to the region's autonomy. Thunberg has not responded to the criticism but retweeted Time magazine's cover featuring herself. Today President Donald Trump lashed out at 16 year old global warming activist Greta Thunberg on Thursday and told her to 'chill' as he called her Time magazine 'Person of the Year' award 'ridiculous.' 'Greta must work on her Anger Management problem then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta Chill!' Trump tweeted The president was responding to Christian filmmaker Roma Downey who tweeted the Time cover with the word 'Congrats.' Minutes after his tweet Thunberg changed her Twitter profile biography to read 'A teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend.' Thunberg was in Madrid on Wednesday where she addressed negotiators at the U.N.'s COP25 climate talks. There she accused political and business leaders of polishing their images rather than taking aggressive action in the fight against climate change at the UN climate talks. In a speech the teenager also criticized governments for avoiding taking action to cut greenhouse gas emissions and 'not behaving as if we are in an emergency'. Greta said 'The biggest danger is not inaction the real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening when in fact almost nothing is being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR.' She said the science showed that at the current rate of emissions the world is set to use up the whole 'carbon budget' the amount of pollution that can be put into the atmosphere and still keep global warming to 1.5C in eight years.

Comedian Bill Nye accused CNN of doing a disservice to its viewers for inviting a well respected physicist on Earth Day to argue about the legitimacy of man made global warming. Nye who is well known for hosting a childrens TV show in the 1990s scolded CNNs New Day Saturday panel Saturday for pitting his environmentalist pedigree against the climate skepticism of physicistWilliam Happer. He also suggested the 24 news channel should instead drown out people like Happer with 98 scientists who believe in man made global warming. And I will say much as I love the CNN youre doing a disservice by having one climate change skeptic and not 97 or 98 scientists or engineers concerned about climate change Nye said after the Princeton University academic suggested that it is a myth to believe that carbon dioxide is a pollutant causing widespread ecological destruction. Carbon dioxide is a perfectly natural gas its just like water vapor its something that plants love. They grow better with more carbon dioxide and you can see the greening of the earth already from the additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere he added. He went on to say that Nyes views on science are backward. Science is based on observation Happer said and if you observe whats happening to for example the temperature the temperature is not rising nearly as fast as the alarmist computer models predicted. Its much much less factors of two or three less. Happer a science adviser to President Donald Trump made public his skeptical views on climate change in January. He told reporters that climate change is tremendously exaggerated adding that climate research is important but I think its become sort of a cult movement in the last five years. Nye who has a degree in engineering but no professional science background called Happers position completely wrong and suggested the physicist was cherry picking a certain model. Some scientists maintain people like Nye are the ones cherry picking data. Climate models predicted Antarctic sea ice would shrink and that climate change would boost snowfall in the southern hemisphere yet neither of those predictions have panned out. In fact scientists now say natural variability is overwhelming their models. Scientists with Columbia Universitys Earth Institute for instance found theres beenalmost no change in Antarcticas snowfall. They blamed strong natural variability for the models failures. Scientists have also warned thatAntarctica has been losing 147 gigatons of ice per yearfor years mostly from melting on the northern Antarctic Peninsula. A NASA conducted in 2015 meanwhile foundAntarcticas ice sheet increased in mass from 1992 to 2008 which essentially offset ice melting in the western part of the Antarctic. Nye for his part has been one of the most belligerent apostle for the environmental movement. Hes even suggested that throwingglobal warming skeptics in jail could be a potential solutionduring an interview with the conservative Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow.

WASHINGTON Michigan GOP Rep. Tim Walberg isnt concerned about the effects of climate change if it exists because God will take care of it. Walberg was speaking to constituents in Coldwater Mich. last week when he was asked about climate change. Walbergwho has previously questioned the existence of global warmingfirst joked that he could take some global warming at home in Michigan because it was too cold and some global cooling in Washingtonbecause of the humidity. Walberg then conceded that the climate was changing before adding that wasn't anything new. I believe theres climate change Walberg said according to a video of the exchange obtained first published by the Huffington Post. I believe theres been climate change since the beginning of time. I think there are cycles. Do I think man has some impact? Yeah of course. Can man change the entire universe? No. Why do I believe that? he continued. Well as a Christian I believe that there is a creator in God who is much bigger than us. And Im confident that if theres a real problem he can take care of it. On Thursday afternoon President Trump is expected to announce whether the United States will remain a member of the Paris climate agreement.

The Trump administration has halted a study looking at the health risks of mountaintop removal coal mining. In a letter written on Friday the Interior Department announced the shutdown of the study which was started in 2016 under former President Barack Obama while the department undergoes an agency wide budgetary review. Scientists estimate at least 500 Appalachian mountaintops have undergone mountaintop removal mining a form of surface mining that harvests coal deposits too thin to work from a coal mine. The study had been launched at the request of two West Virginia agencies the state's Department of Environmental Protection and Bureau for Public Health. Ordered by the Obama administration the 1million two year study looked to investigate mountaintop removal in West Virginia Kentucky Virginia and Tennessee. An emphasis was placed on studying the 'effects from surface coal mining operations on air surface water groundwater and drinking water quality and on ecologic communities and soil that could potentially lead to human health concerns.' This came after a 2010 study in Science magazine reported an increase in mortality rates as well as an increase in incidences of lung cancer and kidney disease near where mountaintop mining is common. Birth defects were also reported in a 2011 study published in Science Daily. Some suggest the move may be part of President Donald Trump's efforts to bring back coal. In February he scrapped the Stream Protection Rule a regulation to protect waterways from coal mining waste and promised to bring back coal mining jobs. Additionally his proposed 2018 budget would cut funding for the Office of Surface Mining which is responsible for protecting society and the environment from the adverse effects of surface coal mining operations. Critics have railed against the Interior Department for moves seen as halting scientific growth. Several science advisory boards were frozen earlier this year by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. And Interior Department climate scientist Joel Clement allegedthat he and dozens of other scientists had been arbitrarily reassigned. 'It's infuriating that Trump would halt this study on the health effects of mountaintop removal coal mining research that people in Appalachia have been demanding for years' Bill Price Senior Appalachia Organizing Representative for Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign said in a statement. 'Stopping this study is a ploy to stop science in its tracks and keep the public in the dark about health risks as a favor to the mining industry pure and simple' said Democratic Representative Ral Grijalva of Arizona ranking member of the House Committee on Natural Resources in a statement.

PAHOA Hawaii Reuters A large explosion in Hawaiis Kilauea volcano on Wednesday may mark the beginning of more violent explosive eruptions that could spray rocks for miles kilometers and dust nearby towns in volcanic ash and smog the U.S. Geological Survey said. Kilauea Hawaiis most active volcano erupted on Thursday and a powerful earthquake shook the crater the next day. Lava flows from fissures on its flank have destroyed at least 36 homes and other buildings and caused the evacuation of some 2000 residents. The USGS warned that more violent eruptions at the crater could begin mid May shooting rocks weighing several tons for over half a mile 1 km hurling pebble sized projectiles several miles km and dusting areas up 20 miles 32 km away with ash. This is the first of perhaps more events like that to come Tina Neal the scientist in charge of the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said on a conference call of Wednesdays blast which shot projectiles from the crater. The town of Hilo some 25 miles 40 km northeast of Kilauea on Hawaiis Big Island and the village of Pahoa 24 miles 39 km east could be exposed to volcanic air pollution or so called vog and a layer of ash should explosive eruptions begin and prevailing wind directions shift Neal said. Such steam driven explosions would be triggered by water running into the craters falling lava lake should it drop below the level of groundwater. Geologists cautioned that Kilaueas past explosions had been relatively small on a global scale and while ash from the volcano posed a nuisance as an eye and respiratory irritant it was not a serious health hazard. We dont anticipate there being any wholesale devastation or evacuations necessary anywhere in the state of Hawaii said Donald Swanson of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.USGS Hawaii County Civil Defense said all 1900 residents of the Leilani Estates and Laipuna Garden areas around 25 miles 40 km east of the crater had been evacuated. Lava oozing from two new fissures in the area had paused but sulfur dioxide gas was still a hazard. Exposure to very high levels of the gas which causes acid rain can be life threatening according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Evacuee David Nail was anxious to learn if his house had been destroyed. He was asleep on the couch when a fissure opened up 2000 feet 610 meters away spewing out lava and gas. It sounded like 10 or 20 jet engines said Nail. The 57 year old who recently retired to the area from Orange County California said he had seen drone footage showing lava flowing up his driveway causing two propane tanks to explode. He tried to reach his house on Tuesday but he and his neighbors were blocked by a 20 foot tall 6 meter tall wall of lava. All we could do was sit there and cry he said. Fourteen fissures have opened since Kilaueas vents started spraying fountains of lava up to 300 feet 90 meters into the air on Thursday and about 104 acres 42 hectares of land have been covered with lava. Kilauea has been in a state of nearly constant eruption for 35 years. It predominantly blows off basaltic lava in effusive eruptions that flow into the ocean but occasionally experiences more explosive events. A powerful magnitude 6.9 earthquake on the volcanos south flank shook the area on Friday. It was the second largest of the last century in Hawaii. More earthquakes and eruptions have been forecast perhaps for months to come. Hawaiis Volcanoes National Park where Kilauea is located remains open to tourists albeit with some restrictions.

Consumer goods giant Procter Gamble faces pressure from environmentalists to clean up its act. More than 150 groups are pushing the maker of Charmin toiler paper and Bounty paper towels to use recycled materials in its products. Currently neither of those products uses recycled paper and about one third of it is sourced from Canada's boreal forest a large swath of virgin forest that rings the Arctic Circle and acts as a critical check on climate change. It's just unacceptable that a company like PG is making toilet paper a product that is used for seconds and flushed from virgin pulp said Shelley Vinyard boreal corporate campaign manager for the Natural Resources Defense Council and one of several dozen protesters at PG's annual shareholders meeting in Cincinnati Ohio on Tuesday. The NRDC likens Canada's vast forests to the Amazon of North. Replacing just half of PG's virgin pulp usage with recycled content would dwarf the company's current climate commitments the NRDC said in a letter to the company that was co signed by 150 other activist groups. PG offers a simple reason for not using recycled wood pulp It doesn't make for good toilet paper. Have you tried recycled toilet paper yourself? a PG spokeswoman asked CBS MoneyWatch who also pointed to Charmin as a superior product. I promise you'll enjoy it much more she said. PG is one of the world's largest consumer products companies with annual revenue of 67 billion and a stock market value of 305 billion. Along with Charmin and Bounty its many brands include Crest toothpaste Gillette razors Head Shoulders shampoo Pampers diapers and Tide laundry detergent. Toilet paper made from recycled fibers doesn't have the same qualities causing people to use more tissue made directly from trees the spokeswoman added. She also noted that PG's experience making recycled tissue products shows that a significant amount of recycled fibers ends up as solid waste sludge going to landfill. Instead PG promises to source its paper from forests that are well managed which in the company's view is a more responsible course of action than using recycled products. About 40 of its product line today comes from forests certified by the Forest Stewardship Council a nonprofit conservation group according to the company and the FSC. Personally I buy recycled toilet paper because we can and it's good for the Earth said Andrew Musgrave director of Catholic Social Action at the Archdiocese of Cincinnati and one of the 150 signatories to the letter sent to PG. Musgrave said he learned about the issue of deforestation for toilet paper relatively recently through a member of the congregation and that it was a natural fit with church teachings on preserving the environment. We believe in the dignity of life and part of that is having a place to live he said. He added that Cincinnati based PG had a history of supporting work and social justice in the community and he believed it was possible to shift to a recycled paper product without reducing quality. Frankly there are a lot of different companies that have moved in the direction of using recycled paper and I have a hard time imagining that they would have done it if it were not economically sustainable Musgrave said. Making paper sustainably doesn't necessarily mean using 100 recycled content said Stephen Donofrio director of the Ecosystem Marketplace initiative at the nonprofit Forest Trends. It could potentially be a mix. It could be single source certified and recycled. Wood has a heavy presence in most U.S. bathrooms Americans use more tissue paper than any other nation except China which has more than four times its population. That comes out to 36 billion rolls per year according to an analysis in Scientific American. The top three companies in what's called the tissue industry PG Kimberly Clark and Georgia Pacific rely almost exclusively on virgin pulp for their products. Last week PG promised to increase the portion of FSC certified fiber in its products to 75 from the current 40 within six years and to better protect caribou habitat in the Canadian forest where it gets much of its pulp. FSC certification limits forest clear cutting and ensures trees are re planted at the same rate they are harvested. However even harvesting from a sustainably managed forest has an environmental cost when compared with leaving trees uncut in the first place. The question we should be asking is whether or not those products are from virgin primary forests which are rich with biodiversity food systems and other ecosystems Donofrio said. It's that natural infrastructure that we're trying to avoid being lost. When companies make these pledges to be sustainably sourced or use recycled content that's the problem that they're solving.

Wyoming's economy is dominated by coal other fossil fuels and mineral extraction. The formula here has worked residents in Wyoming enjoy among the highest per capita GDP in the nation. So naturally there's been some hostility toward new sources of energy that could threaten that. It's a complicated history with wind says Jeremiah Rieman director of economic diversification strategy for Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead R. I think you're seeing a change. And certainly we're hearing the message loud and clear as we go through this economic diversification strategy effort that wind and renewables need to be a part of that. The push toward wind is playing out in a high rise office building 100 miles south of Wyoming's capital in Denver. There TransWest Express is laying out plans to build a 730 mile transmission line across the American West. CEO Bill Miller points to a map and the start of the project 1000 wind turbines to be built on a ranch in south central Wyoming. It starts there and runs a little bit west and then due south into northwest Colorado says Miller tracing a line through Utah and then down south of Las Vegas. If all goes according to plan in three years Miller says the winds of low population Wyoming will be bringing electricity to where it's needed in California. To my knowledge this is the largest transmission line development that has occurred in this country in probably 50 years. TransWest Express which is part of the Anschutz Corporation owned by billionaire Phillip Anschutz is looking to harness Wyoming's wind because well it's super windy. The winds howl in southeast Wyoming because they're rising at the continental divide then pushing through a gap in the Rocky Mountains. So if you remember your high school physics class there's this thing called the Venturi effect where you narrow something and that naturally speeds up an air flow. And that's really what we have here says economist Robert Godby director of the Center for Energy Economics and Public Policy at the University of Wyoming. Wyoming may have strong winds but the state ranks just 16th for wind generation. Godby says Wyoming hasn't exactly made things attractive for developers We have the only wind generation tax in the country where we actually tax people who produce electricity with wind. Meanwhile many other states are creating incentives for wind development for example by creating renewable portfolio standards that require a state to obtain a certain amount of its energy from sources like wind and solar. I think it's really unfair that Wyoming has this reputation for being hostile to wind or anti wind says Jason Beggar director the Wyoming Infrastructure Authority a state entity tasked with developing large transmission projects. It's not an anti wind philosophy it's just the philosophy of the state we tax our natural resources to fund government. Beggar says it's tough to build in Wyoming because roughly half of the state is federally owned land. So when you go to Texas or you go to Iowa you're generally just negotiating with a landowner whether it's a farmer whomever says Beggar. Well in Wyoming you have to file permits with the federal government and that includes things like land use wildlife mitigation mineral disturbances. There are factors and factors and factors. Beggar says the Trump administration has shown a willingness to cut red tape and move things along more quickly. Meanwhile conservationists and environmentalists have bristled at the rollback of regulations. There's another challenge facing Wyoming wind climate change skepticism. Coal burns dirty and produces a lot of greenhouse gases. Many states are pushing renewable energy to move away from that. But in Wyoming it's complicated. Climate change is a pretty tough subject to talk about with some people because it's a threat no matter how you look at it says Robert Godby. It's a threat to world climate it's also a threat to people's livelihoods in Wyoming. And those two things are kind of in conflict. If you're a state like Wyoming where you produce so much fossil fuel in particular coal that's threatened by any sort of climate change policy we might put in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Wyoming's governor Matt Mead professes skepticism on climate science but not on the markets which are moving away from dirtier burning fuels like coal. That's why he's pushing for a more diversified economy. At the end of the day the debate in Wyoming is really about jobs. Bill Miller says that when people learn about the tax revenues and jobs their transmission line and wind farm will bring to Wyoming they like that. These are good high paying jobs. And when we finish this project the permanent jobs are going to be roughly 150 people well paid fully benefitted jobs that are really a boon to those communities says Miller. Wind projects in Wyoming won't come anywhere close to creating enough work to replace the coal industry. Still the jobs are an important part of the state's broader diversification strategy. Roughly 60 percent of our youth between the ages of 18 and 24 will not be here 10 years from now and that's a trend we would like to see disappear says Rieman. Whether new opportunities come from digging up coal or harnessing the wind for job seekers in Wyoming that detail may be of secondary importance. This article originally appeared at PRI's The World.

There are growing fears that the unchecked use of antibiotics in both medicine and agriculture will have adverse effects on the environment and on human health AFP PhotoLOIC VENANCE Paris AFP Residues from billions of doses of antibiotics painkillers and antidepressants pose a significant risk to freshwater ecosystems and the global food chain a new analysis said Thursday. There are growing fears that the unchecked use of antibiotics in both medicine and agriculture will have adverse effects on the environment and on human health. When animals and humans ingest medicines up to 90 percent of active ingredients are excreted back into the environment. Many medicines are simply discarded in the United States alone an estimated one third of the four billion drugs prescribed each year ends up as waste. The Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD compared data on concentrations of pharmaceutical residue in water samples worldwide as well as prescribing trends and water purification regulations in various countries. One study cited in its report estimates that 10 percent of all pharmaceuticals are potentially harmful to the environment including hormones painkillers and antidepressants. The OECD said that antibiotic use for livestock is predicted to rocket by more than two thirds in the next decade stoking concerns over antibiotic resistance. Human prescriptions are also set to drastically increase according to the report. We're seeing constant engineering of new pharmaceuticals and seeing clinical practices evolve to include recommendations of earlier treatment and higher doses said the lead report author Hannah Leckie. Another study cited said extremely high concentrations of pharmaceutical products had already been detected in water ways in China India Israel South Korea and the United States. In Britain alone ethinyloestradiol diclofenac ibuprofen propranolol and antibiotics are now present in the run off of 890 wastewater treatment plants at high enough levels to cause adverse environmental effects according to another study. The residues of pharmaceuticals have been detected in surface and ground water across the world said Leckie. However there's still a lot we don't know about their occurence and know even less about the concentrations we find. More than 700000 people already die each year from drug resistant infections. As the global population grows and ages and prescribing rates continue to climb that figure is set to hit 10 million annually by 2050 higher than the number of people dying from cancer. Unless adequate measures are taken to manage the risks pharmaceutical residues will increasingly be released into the environment as ageing populations advances in healthcare and intensification of meat and fish production spur the demand for pharmaceuticals worldwide the report said. And the situation is set to get even more acute as climate change increases the spread and frequency of infectious diseases such as malaria and dengue. Leckie said there was something of a vicious circle when it came to medical prescriptions and climate related disease.

WASHINGTON Reuters The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday rejected for now a bid by the President Donald Trumps administration to block a trial in a lawsuit filed by young activists who have accused the U.S. government of ignoring the perils of climate change. The loss for the administration means it now faces a high profile examination of U.S. climate change policy during the trial that was due to begin on Oct. 29 in Eugene Oregon but has since been postponed by the judge. Chief Justice John Roberts on Oct. 19 had temporarily put the case on hold while the court as a whole decided how to proceed. The Supreme Courts three page order noted that the administration may still have grounds to take its arguments to the San Francisco based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch indicated they would have granted the administrations request. There was no indication how Trumps new Supreme Court appointee conservative Brett Kavanaugh voted on the issue. In the lawsuit 21 activists ages 11 to 22 said federal officials violated their rights to due process under the U.S. Constitution by failing to adequately address carbon pollution such as emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The lawsuit was filed in 2015 against former President Barack Obama and government agencies in a federal court in Eugene Oregon. Both the Obama and Trump administrations have failed in efforts to have the lawsuit thrown out. The administration has said a courtroom is not the appropriate venue for a debate on climate change policy. This suit is an attempt to redirect federal environmental and energy policies through the courts rather than through the political process by asserting a new and unsupported fundamental due process right to certain climate conditions Trump administration Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in court papers. Francisco noted that the plaintiffs are seeking to hold the U.S. government liable for the cumulative effects of carbon dioxide emissions from every source in the world over decades. Lawyers for the young activists led by Julia Olson of a Eugene based group called Our Childrens Trust that brought the lawsuit have said their clients have suffered irreparable harm from the effects of a changing climate. This is a case about the fundamental rights of children and whether the actions of their government have deprived them of their inalienable rights Olson said in court papers. On July 30 the high court rejected an earlier application by the Trump administration calling it premature. Eugene Oregon based federal Judge Ann Aiken has repeatedly allowed the case to move forward to trial over the objections of the government. The trial will proceed if neither the high court nor the 9th Circuit intervene. Aiken said in an Oct. 15 ruling that although the case raised questions about the role of the judiciary delving into a matter of policy those concerns were not enough to warrant a dismissal of the entire case.

WASHINGTON A mammoth lands bill that would protect more than 2 million acres and permanently reauthorize a key land and water conservation program heads to President Donald Trump following the House's overwhelming approval Tuesday. The 363 62 vote to pass theNatural Resources Management Act came two weeks after the Senate approved the bill 92 8. Years in the crafting the measurecombines more than 100 separate bills that collectively would designate1340000 acres of new wilderness 367 miles of new scenic rivers and 2600 miles of new national trails. It also would createfour national monuments including the home of slain civil rights icon Medgar Eversin Mississippiand expandthree national parks including Joshua Tree in California. In addition the legislation would require the U.S. Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to begin providing GPS locations for crews on wildfires and to begin using drones to scout and map wildfires in real time. The bill won easy passage in the House in part because it included dozens of individual member's parochial priorities stretching across all 50 states. But it also enjoyed larger buy in. Democratsgot behind the bill because it would expand environmental protections. Republicans supported it because it would expand access to public lands for recreational and hunting purposes. Related Green New Deal What is it and what does it mean for climate change? Related Crumbling national parks Congress looks to hike funds for repairs after years of neglect The very basis of all of the bills that are in here is to put people above government Utah Rep. Rob Bishop the top Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee said on the House floor before the vote. If indeed we're going to have public lands there should be access to those lands. The measure also permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund which uses federal royalties from oil and gas drilling to preserve public lands. It had expired in September. Although the bill does not guarantee that the royalties about 900 million a year flow into the program environmental groups consider making the LWCF permanent an enormous victory. Rep. Debbie Dingell D Mich praised the program for its universal benefits saying the conservation fund has steered 3.9 billion to some 40000 projects in every county across this country since it began in the 1960s. LWCF has protected some of our most treasured natural resources while creating jobs supporting local economies and providing countless opportunitiesfor recreation she said on the House floor.

U.S. Formally Begins To Leave The Paris Climate Agreement The Trump administration has formally notified the United Nations that the U.S. is withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement. The withdrawal will be complete this time next year after a one year waiting period has elapsed. We will continue to work with our global partners to enhance resilience to the impacts of climate change and prepare for and respond to natural disasters Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement Monday. Nearly 200 countries signed on to the agreement in 2015 and made national pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Each country set its own goals and many wealthy countries including the U.S. also agreed to help poorer countries pay for the costs associated with climate change. The U.S. is now the only country to pull out of the pact. The United States is not cooperating with the rest of the world on dealing with climate change says Andrew Light a former climate official in the State Department who helped develop the Paris Agreement. The agreement was designed to be easier to join than to leave. The U.S. even helped spearhead language that would hold countries accountable for the promises they made in part to help guard against regime changes and other global political turmoil. Indeed in the years since the pact was created many key international players including Brazil China Japan and India have experienced economic or political upheaval but none has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement as a result. President Trump originally announced his intention to withdraw from the deal in the summer of 2017 shortly after he took office. At the time he said As of today the United States will cease all implementation of the agreement including federal policies meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as U.S. contributions to the international climate fund for poorer nations. These agreements are just only as good as the commitments from each country Light says. The U.S. had pledged to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions by about a quarter by 2025 compared with 2005 levels. The country is not on track to achieve that goal. In the intervening years the Trump administration has systematically attempted to roll back federal limits on carbon emissions including rules about how much pollution can be emitted by power plants cars and trucks. The reality is to really deliver on our climate goals we do need strong federal action says Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Concerned Scientists. The unfortunate reality is U.S. carbon emissions actually rose last year. This isn't the first time the U.S. has reneged on an international climate agreement. The U.S. failed to ratify the 1997 Kyoto Protocol despite being instrumental in its creation. In this case the U.S. became a signatory to the agreement but almost immediately signaled that it didn't intend to pursue its responsibilities. In both cases the U.S. was instrumental in developing the international strategy. That's one of the ironies of all this Light says. When the Paris Agreement was being negotiated the U.S. delegation pushed for more transparency and accountability to make sure the countries that signed on would actually do what they promised. Even though we're the ones who have been pointing to these potential scenarios for problems with other countries we seem to be the biggest problem Light says. If we were a tiny country with small emissions it wouldn't matter so much he says. But we're not. We're a big country with a lot of power and a lot of influence around the world. And so for us to be the exception on this issue is holding the world back. A formal withdrawal is reversible however if a future administration chooses to rejoin the Paris Agreement and pick up where the U.S. left off with its emissions reduction promises.

Hes written poems lamenting legal abortion. He wants to make gay sex illegal and overturn marriage equality. The former judge says he places Gods law above the Constitution describes Islam as a false religion and has repeatedly defied federal orders to remove religious ornaments from his courtroom. He doesnt believe in evolution compares preschool to Nazi style indoctrinationand once said the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks were divine punishment for the United States godlessness. His campaign site calls for energy independence and stakes out the vague position Coal mining and oil drilling should be encouraged subject only to reasonable regulations. In July he was the only candidate to refuse to answer questions about climate change for a Montgomery Advertiser story. Katie Frost his spokeswoman did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Not only do scientists disagree on global warming but there is little hard evidence that carbon emissions cause changes to the global climate. But it appears that Obama and his liberal administration are not really interested in what the Constitution or the scientific community have to say when it interferes with their radical agenda. In fact 97 percent of peer reviewed scientists have found that climate change is a serious threat and is at least exacerbated by humans. And there are serious flaws in the studies published by the 3 percent of scientists whose research suggests otherwise. A research review published last November found errors in the methodologies assumptions or analyses used by in those studies that when fixed put the findings in line with mainstream climate scientists. That consensus is so strong that in 2005 one of the standard bearers of the evangelical Christian politics in which Moore enshrouds himself planned to take a stance affirming the science. That year the National Association of Evangelicals proposed adopting a new platform called For the Health of a Nation. The position paper called for protecting Gods creation and embracing the governments help in doing so. But after receiving unanimous support by the board the 30 million member organization voted down the proposal kickstarting a campaign by fossil fuel interests to transform the doubt over global warming into what Splinter in a lengthy report published in August succinctly described as the word of God. White evangelical Christians more than 80 percent of whom supported Trump in last Novembers election are the least likely of any U.S. religious group to believe climate change is occurring according to 2015 data from the Pew Research Center. Just 28 percent of white evangelicals believe the planet is warming primarily due to human activity compared with 56 percent of black Protestants and 41 percent of white mainline Protestants who say the opposite. Roughly 37 percent of white evangelicals dont believe the climate is changing at all. This is a demographic Moore who attends the Gallant First Baptist Church near his home seems likely to tap. Alabama has the highest percentage of Baptists after Tennessee with 31 percent of residents in the state according to Pews 2014 Religious Landscape study. In December The Baptist Press the official media arm of the Southern Baptist Convention published an open letter of support for Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitts nomination amid fierce backlash over the former Oklahoma attorney generals rejection of the scientific consensus on climate change. On one side of that debate is a theological argument thats gained prominence in some corners of evangelical Christianity over the past decade. According to that interpretation God provided fossil fuels for humans to exploit and Christian environmentalists who believed in shifting to renewable energy were deceived by the false doctrine of the so called Green Dragon a demonic force that fooled people into putting the needs of the planet ahead of those of the poor. As a Christian I have a responsibility to try my best to be as wealthy as possible James Wanliss an associate professor of physics at Presbyterian College in South Carolina and the author ofThe Green Dragon Is Global Warming a Religion? told HuffPost. If youre grindingly poor youre just going to care about your next meal and too bad if trees get in your way. I see that some of the anthropogenic global warming rhetoric has been picked up by people who are really excited about trying to experiment with those types of systems in the West as a solution to those problemsWanliss said. As a Christian thats a problem to me because well aside from the philosophy behind those systems its just again empirically been disastrous. Roy Moore hes part of that culture Michael Hansen executive director of the Birmingham based environmental group Gasp and a former candidate in the Democratic primary for Senate told HuffPost. Something that I hear quite a bit from the right wing in Alabama is that God gave us fossil fuels for a reason. I wouldnt be surprised if Roy Moore said that at some point during his campaign. Alabama emerged in June from more than a year of the worst drought in memory affecting 98 percent of the state. The state braced twice in the past month for damage from the devastating series of hurricanes that struck neighboring states but it was spared the destruction after the winds weakened. Yet nearly 37 percent of Alabamians dont believe global warming is happening 7 percentage points below the national average according to survey data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.

The word choices by administration officials and the extent to which they're going to avoid referencing global warming altogether are notable in the aftermath of recent severe hurricanes and in the face of questions about what could have caused them. In the wake of Hurricane Irma both Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long and acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke avoided explicitly answering whether the government needs to be more focused on climate change because of hurricanes. Instead they both said the focus should be on resiliency. Regardless of what causes disasters it's our job within the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA to manage the consequences Long told CNN. The only way we become resilient as a nation is we have to create that true culture of preparedness among our citizenry which we do not have and then we also have to look how we move forward when it comes to infrastructure protection. Duke echoed Long's thoughts on the need for resilience. We live in a changing world and as the FEMA administrator said we always have to look at not just the response but the preparedness and the resilience Duke said. And I think it's important that as we come together as a country we look at the changes in our world and make sure that in planning and response that we are adapting properly. Trump dismisses climate change question by contradicting himself on hurricanes Other departments are also adopting the language replacement in some cases making unannounced changes and replacements to their websites and names of programs. In February shortly after President Donald Trump took office the Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration changed language across its website relating to the environmental effects of transportation. The changes swapped words like adaptation with resilience and also renamed the Sustainable Transport and Climate Change Team to The Sustainable Transportation and Resilience Team according to a Environmental Data and Governance Initiative Website Tracking report That same month the Environmental Protection Agency removed all mention of climate change from its water utilities programs. The Climate Ready Water Utilities program was renamed to Creating Resilient Water Utilities. Other references to climate change were also scrubbed from the website Inside Climate News first reported. Over at the USDA an internal memo obtained by CNN that was shared in the first days of the administration to staffers gave specific guidance to ditch the term climate change adaptation and instead opt for resilience to weather extremes. The terms resilience and resiliency rose to popularity in the US government during former President Barack Obama's administration used specifically to denote preparing something to ward off the future effects of climate change. For example following Superstorm Sandy the Department of Housing and Urban Development established a first of its kind competition called the National Disaster Resilience Competition. The aim of the competition was to award grants to communities hit by natural disasters to fund rebuilding them to better weather future events worsened by climate change. The idea is when dollars are spent to rebuild you don't just want to rebuild the same old way you want to rebuild in a way that is smarter and makes it less likely that they will be effected the same way in the future storms that's resiliency former HUD Secretary Julian Castro who awarded the grant at the time told CNN. There's no question that climate change is at least a contributing factor to some of the intensity of these natural disasters. ... The administration ought to take that into consideration and not try to decouple those two Castro said. The verbal judo they are trying to do doesn't serve local communities at all. But administration officials counter that resiliency can have a dual meaning even one that means essentially the same thing but without the overt climate change undertones. Resilience came into our nomenclature in our last administration but that doesn't mean that it's a verboten word any longer said Brian Sullivan a HUD spokesman. The last administration made that very direct connection between the use of that word and words like sustainability with climate change and while there may be a reluctance to do that now I don't think that means folks are any less committed to making sure the next storm is less costly Sullivan said. While Sullivan acknowledged that there's been an intentional shift of language at the department especially as the topic of climate change continues to be discussed or avoided hand in hand with storm preparedness he argues that at the end of the day the administration has the same goals for rebuilding communities. I don't know if there's an operating definition of what resilience means he said. Regardless of why you're doing it what you're doing would be the same whatever motivates you. Whether you believe in climate change or you don't you are embarking on some future activity. We could tie this to climate change or we could tie it to saving taxpayer money.

Its been repeated throughout the media Future global warming could wipe out one tenth of the U.S. economy by 2100. Its a top line finding of a major government climate report but its based on a study funded by groups affiliated with two major Democratic donors. The oft repeated claim also stemmed from a global warming projection thats come under increased scrutiny from experts including one who called it outlandish. The federal government released the second volume of the National Climate Assessment NCA Friday. The federal report issued dire warnings including from ice sheet disintegration on accelerated sea level rise leading to widespread effects on coastal development lasting thousands of years. The report also claims that global greenhouse gas emissions is expected to cause substantial net damage to the U.S. economy throughout this century including a 10 percent hit to gross domestic product GDP in one extreme scenario. RELATED Trump Touts Oil Prices Getting Lower As Millions Hit The Road For Thanksgiving However NCAs dire prediction of a 10 percent hit to U.S. GDP comes from a 2017 study supported by the charitable foundations founded by major Democratic donors. The study was also funded by other organizations including theNational Science Foundation the U.S. Department of Energy and the Skoll Global Threats Fund. That 2017 study published in the journal Science was funded in part by Bloomberg Philanthropies and Next Generation which were founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and San Francisco billionaire Tom Steyer respectively. University of Colorado professor Roger Pielke Jr. pointed out problems with the study on Twitter Saturday including the fact it was funded by groups connected with Bloomberg and Steyer. Bloomberg and Steyer were the biggest donors to Democratic aligned political action groups in the 2016 election cycle according to the Center for Responsive Politics CRP. Bloomberg who founded Bloomberg Philanthropies handed nearly 60 million to liberal SuperPACs to help put Democratic candidates in office and defeat Republicans in the 2018 election cycle according to the CRP. Steyer who co founded Next Generation gave roughly 58.7 million to liberal SuperPACs according to CRP. Bloomberg and Steyer back the Paris climate accord and Obama era policies to phase out fossil fuels. The Bloomberg Steyer funded study found future temperature rise could cost roughly 1.2 of gross domestic product per additional one degree Celsius increase on average. At the most extreme high end that could add up to 10 percent of GDP by 2100. Pielke called the use of such an extreme scenario embarrassing because its based on a future thats 15 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in other words twice what the United Nations most extreme scenario projects. But even the United Nations worst case scenario called RCP8.5 is being called into question by experts. A study published in 2017 found RCP8.5 was exceptionally unlikely because it suffered from systematic errors in fossil production outlooks. Imagine if research funded by Exxon was sole basis for claims. Given weaknesses of the work its just foolish to lean on it so much Pielke tweeted. Major media outlets however did no such examination of the NCAs reliance on such an outlandish claim as Pielke called it. CNN reported the economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars or in the worst case scenario more than 10 of its GDP by 2100. The news outlets headline warned future warming could also kill thousands. All told the report says climate change could slash up to a tenth of gross domestic product by 2100 more than double the losses of the Great Recession a decade ago The New York Times reported of the NCA. Andrew Light a distinguished senior fellow at the World Resources Institute and reviewer of the chapter highlighting the Bloomberg Steyer funded study did not respond to The Daily Caller News Foundations request for comment. Instead Light forwarded TheDCNFs request to the U.S. Global Change Research Program USGCRP which is responsible for producing the NCA. USGCRP has yet to respond to TheDCNFs request. The NCA was put together with input from 13 federal agencies and outside scientists.

At a town hall event in Ames Iowa Wednesday Democrat candidate for president Beto ORourke compared the Green New Deal to defeating the Nazis and surviving the Great Depression. Why is it that Democrats clearly lacking in any context of what World War II and living in the greatest generation were like enjoy comparing these things to mundane policy initiatives? Addressing the Green New Deal ORourke summoned his followers to harness the the most ingenious mechanism yet devised by humankind to free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels. The mechanism Robert Francis is referring to is a democracy. Meanwhile what comes out of Betos mouth next is not in fact ingenious. Its exactly what we did to face the Nazi threat the existential threat to Western democracies in 1941 he said. Exactly what we did to lift millions out of the Great Depression and build the largest middle class the world had yet seen. And is exactly what we need to do now to free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels greenhouse gas emissions invest in the jobs and technologies of renewable energy that will allow us to meet our obligation and allow this country once again to claim its status as the indispensable nation. Its hard not to look at this hyperactive Gen X er and think this is exactly what the far left has become a group that has rarely experienced hardship in their lifetime because of the greatest generation comparing everything they find upsetting to the greatest generation. Beto likes his World War II comparisons so much that he mentions it time and again when discussing the threat of global warming. Sure every time he mentions it ORourke is mocked relentlessly by those outside of his little campaign crowds. But he doesnt care because in his mind its real. How else to explain last months comments that environmental activists are just like those who were on the beaches in Normandy. When you think about leadership those who preceded us those who were on the beaches in Normandy those who faced an existential threat to Western democracy and our way of life they showed us the way he said referencing a plan to fight climate change. This is the final chance he added echoing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez warning that the world will end due to climate change. The scientists are unanimous on this. We have no more than 12 years to take incredibly bold action on this crisis. Every time I watch this guy speak I think of the UPS Guy from Mad TV. How does a man who under normal circumstances would be working as a barista in the local coffee shop dole out knowledge of experience on World War II to a Democrat party who eagerly laps it up? How did the resistance get to this point? Its embarrassing.	False	True	False	False	False
CNN A new US government report delivers a dire warning about climate change and its devastating impacts saying the economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars or in the worst case scenario more than 10 of its GDP by the end of the century. The federally mandated study was supposed to come out in December but was released by the Trump administration on Friday at a time when many Americans are on a long holiday weekend distracted by family and shopping. The global average temperature is much higher and is rising more rapidly than anything modern civilization has experienced and this warming trend can only be explained by human activities Easterling said. Coming from the US Global Change Research Program a team of 13 federal agencies the Fourth National Climate Assessment was put together with the help of 1000 people including 300 leading scientists roughly half from outside the government. Without significant reductions in greenhouse emissions the annual average global temperature could increase 9 degrees Fahrenheit 5 Celsius or more by the end of this century compared with preindustrial temperatures the report says. The costs of climate change could reach hundreds of billions of dollars annually according to the report. The Southeast alone will probably lose over a half a billion labor hours by 2100 due to extreme heat. Farmers will face extremely tough times. The quality and quantity of their crops will decline across the country due to higher temperatures drought and flooding. In parts of the Midwest farms will be able to produce less than 75 of the corn they produce today and the southern part of the region could lose more than 25 of its soybean yield. Heat stress could cause average dairy production to fall between 0.60 and 1.35 over the next 12 years having already cost the industry 1.2 billion from heat stress in 2010. Wildfire seasons already longer and more destructive than before could burn up to six times more forest area annually by 2050 in parts of the United States. Burned areas in Southwestern California alone could double by 2050. Dependable and safe water for the Hawaii the Caribbean and others are threatened by these rising temperatures. Along the US coasts public infrastructure and 1 trillion in national wealth held in real estate are threatened by rising sea levels flooding and storm surges. Energy systems will be taxed meaning more blackouts and power failures and the potential loss in some sectors could reach hundreds of billions of dollars per year by the end of the century the report said. The number of days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit will multiply Chicago where these days are rare could start to resemble Phoenix or Las Vegas with up to two months worth of these scorching hot days. Sea levels have already gone up 7 to 8 inches since 1900. Almost half that rise has been since 1993 a rate of rise greater than during any century in the past 2800 years. Some countries are already seeing land underwater. By midcentury it's likely that the Arctic will lose all sea ice in late summer and that could lead to more permafrost thaw according to the report. As the permafrost thaws more carbon dioxide and methane would be released amplifying human induced warming possibly significantly. What can be done The report was created to inform policy makers and makes no specific recommendations on how to remedy the problem. However it suggests that if the United States immediately reduced its fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions it could save thousands of lives and generate billions of dollars in benefits for the country. Reactions to the new report have been strong across the scientific community. In Houston communities of color have endured back to back major weather events without the acknowledgment from Washington that climate change is the cause. We've known for years that it's true and it's important to our organizing and our local policy efforts that information like this is not only considered but believed and acted upon. Scientists who have been raising the alarm about the negative consequences of climate change for years welcomed the findings.	True	False	False	True	True
Back in October 2015 Barack Obamas EPA finalized a 460 page rule titled Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources Electric Utility Generating Units aka the Clean Power Plan. This was a part of Obamas pen and phone way of ruling the country. As an aside did you ever see anyone on the left bitch about Obama using the power of the presidency to make policy and weigh in on political and cultural issues the way some on the right bitch about Trump doing it? Did you ever stop to wonder what they know that the current belly achers dont? The purpose of this rule was breathtaking. Using the anthropogenic global warming scaremongering and specious public health predictions the Clean Power Plan essentially put the US coal industry out of business. Since that time the rule has been mired in court challenges and it produced the first instance in history where the Supreme Court presumed a rule was unreasonable before a lower court ruled on the issue The Supreme Court dealt a blow to President Obamas signature climate change initiative Tuesday by halting the administrations effort to reduce pollution from coal fired power plants while a legal battle rages on. The move by the courts five conservative members was a shock to environmentalists who had hoped the justices would deny as a federal appeals court did last month a petition filed by 29 mostly Republican led states and industry leaders. Now the Environmental Protection Agency must halt enforcement of the so called Clean Power Plan until the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit decides on the merits of the GOP industry lawsuit against it. Oral arguments are set for early June. Even if the plan is upheld at the lower court it could not be implemented until the Supreme Court has had the final word. That likely would push the battle into 2017 or beyond. In September 2016 then candidate Donald Trump gave an economic policy speech in which he specifically targeted the Clean Power Plan Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he would repeal four key Environmental Protection Agency regulations as president leading one environmental group to call his plans a dumpster fire. During an economic policy speech in New York Trump said he would eliminate the Clean Power Plan and the Waters of the United States rule. In a fact sheet released accompanying the speech Trumps campaign said he would scale back the latest regulations on ozone pollution and eliminate the EPAs Renewable Identification Number program which is part of the Renewable Fuel Standard program. Trump said the regulations harm U.S. businesses and getting rid of them would help kick start the economy. This Obama Clinton directive will shut down most if not all coal powered electricity plans in America Trump said of the Clean Power Plan. Theyre shutting down all over the country. Remember what Hillary Clinton said? She wants to shut down the miners just like she wants to shut down the steel mills and steel workers. In late March President Trump signed an executive order directing the EPA to review the Clean Power Plan Now it is reported that tomorrow the EPA will being the process of withdrawing the Clean Power Plan. What the EPA is doing is proposing a rule to rescind the existing rule and then it will undertake another administrative rule making process to ask for public input on what a new rule should contain and finally a new rule will be drafted. Im sure Scott Pruitt would prefer to scrap this whole thing unfortunately the US Supreme Court 2007 decision Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency says that EPA regulation of carbon dioxide is actually required by the Clean Air Act and so non regulation is legally off the table unless Congress acts that was a joke. The sum total of this is to take this issue out of the courts and then give the environmental nazis a new chew toy to play with for several years. In the meantime hopefully Congress will act again that was a joke to limit the reach of the Clean Air Act and the ability of activists to use that law to wreak havoc on our economy and communities.

Sen. Kamala Harris was the first candidate to mention the Green New Deal in the first presidential debate when she corrected NBC moderator Chuck Todd. I dont even call it climate change she said. Its a climate crisisThat is why I support a Green New Deal. And yet of the top four presidential candidates Harris has the thinnest legislative record when it comes to climate change her 2019 bill to electrify school bus fleetshas taken only a slice at the problem. On Mondaythe day beforethe second round of debates among the 20 Democratic presidential hopefuls she released the first major climate proposal of her campaign partnering with the original author of the Green New Deal resolution Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. The proposal called the Climate Equity Act is not a comprehensive plan for addressing the climate crisis or cutting pollution but it focuses on addressing equity and environmental racism echoing the broader themes of Harris campaign. It does begin to answer one of the key questions around the Green New Deal debate which is how to include low income and communities of colorthe frontline voices facing the most dire effects of climate changein the legislative process. From the toxic air embattling Cancer Alley in Louisiana and Asthma Alley in the Bronx to the unsafe drinking water in Californias San Joaquin Valley and Flint Michigan Harris said the nations bedrock environmental protections have not stopped frontline communities from continually falling through the cracks. The proposal requires that any environmental legislation receive an equity score to assess its impact on frontline communities much in the same way the Congressional Budget Office scores the economic costs and impacts of bills. The proposal also requires an extra level of scrutiny for White House executive actions on low income communities and people of color and feedback from those affected communities. A new Climate and Environmental Justice officewouldcoordinate all the impact assessment efforts. We cannot accept a status quo where children of color are drinking toxic water in Flint or breathing toxic air in Louisianas Cancer AlleyHarris said in a statement. This systemic environmental injustice will only get worse and become more ingrained if climate and environmental policies like the Green New Deal do not specifically focus on lifting up these communities. Mustafa Ali the former head of the EPA environmental justice office noted that the idea of scoring environmental justice impacts is something advocates have pushed for years. When you look at where most of the fossil fuel facilities are located they are in communities of color Ali said. That same pollution is warming up our planet and warming our oceans. People are starting to pay at lot of attention to climate change and have to address the environmental injustices. Harris is not the only presidential candidate who has come out with a plan focused on environmental justice.Jay Inslee released the fifth plank of his climate change package on Monday that refocuses the White House Council of Environmental Quality as a new clearinghouse for environmental justice and has its own scoring mechanism for impacts. Ali points out an equity score is potentially significant because it helps put up a wall of protections around those communitiesaddingI think its just now starting to gather steam.

Despite longstanding opposition to renewable energy on the part of President Trump who gave a rambling nearly incoherent disquisition on windmills last weekend the wind power industry in the United States continued to grow in 2019. The country set records for newly installed capacity of wind power in both the second and third quarters of 2019 according to a report by the American Wind Energy Association reaching a total of 100 gigawatts roughly on a par with nuclear plants although in terms of actual power generated as distinguished from theoretical capacity wind is still a fraction of nuclear and fossil fuels. Wind now supplies clean and efficient power to the equivalent of 32 million American homes sustains 500 U.S. factories and delivers more than 1 billion a year in new revenue to rural communities and states Tom Kernan CEO of AWEA said in a statement. At a time when global carbon emissions that cause climate change continue to rise wind power now accounts for 6.5 percent of the energy America produces. Once the wind turbines are constructed the energy they produce is carbon neutral and renewable indefinitely. Yet Trump who believes that climate change is a hoax is no fan of windmills as he once again made clear last weekend in a speech in Florida. Well have an economy based on wind. I never understood wind. You know I know windmills very much. Ive studied it better than anybody. I know its very expensive. Theyre made in China and Germany mostly very few made here almost none. But theyre manufactured tremendous if youre into this tremendous fumes Trump asserted. Gases are spewing into the atmosphere. You know we have a world right? So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous tremendous amount of fumes and everything. You talk about the carbon footprint fumes are spewing into the air. Right? Spewing. Whether its in China Germany its going into the air. Its our air their air everything right? So they make these things and then they put them up. Trump who filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against the government of Scotland to block the construction of offshore wind turbines he said would mar the views from one of his golf resorts also complained in his Florida speech that wind turbines killed birds. Go under a windmill someday you'll see more birds than you've ever seen ever in your life Trump said. While it is true that an estimated 234000 birds die each year in collisions with wind turbines according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service many more are killed by flying into buildings or by domestic cats. In 2018 the Trump administration eliminated criminal penalties for unintentional migratory bird deaths resulting from industrial or agricultural activity the New York Times reported. Despite the rapid growth in the construction of wind power facilities across the U.S. the Interior Department announced in August that it was withholding approval for a wind project off the coast of Massachusetts similar to the one Trump opposed in Scotland. Interior Department spokesman Nicholas Goodwin said in a statement that the government needed to make sure the project was safe and environmentally responsible. In April Trump without citing any evidence told a Republican audience that wind turbines were dangerous to human health. They say the noise causes cancer Trump said. That claim like all the others Trump has made about wind power was quickly refuted. The American Cancer Society is unaware of any credible evidence linking the noise from windmills to cancer a spokesman for the group told the Times in an email.

If the world wants to limit climate change water scarcity and pollution then we all need to embrace flexitarian diets say scientists. This means eating mainly plant based foods and is one of three key steps towards a sustainable future for all in 2050 they say. Food waste will need to be halved and farming practices will also have to improve according to the study. Without action the impacts of the food system could increase by up to 90. Fast on the heels of the landmark report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC comes this new study on how food production and consumption impact major threats to the planet. The authors say that the food system has a number of significant environmental impacts including being a major driver of climate change depleting freshwater and pollution through excessive use of nitrogen and phosphorous. The study says that thanks to the population and income growth expected between 2010 and 2050 these impacts could grow between 50 90. This could push our world beyond its planetary boundaries which the authors say represent a safe operating space for humanity on a stable Earth system. However the study finds that no single solution will avert the dangers so a combined approach is needed. So when it comes to climate change the authors looked at what they called a flexitarian diet. We can eat a range of healthy diets but what they all have in common according to the latest scientific evidence is that they are all relatively plant based said lead author Dr Marco Springmann from the University of Oxford. You can go from a diet that has small amounts of animal products some might call it a Mediterranean based diet we call it a flexitarian diet over to a pescatarian vegetarian or vegan diet we tried to stay with the most conservative one of these which in our view is the flexitarian one but even this has only one serving of red meat per week. If the world moved to this type of diet the study found that greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture would be reduced by more than half. But as well as altering diets the research says that farming practices need to change significantly. This involves boosting yields from existing cropland improving water management and restricting and recycling fertiliser use. We looked at improving agricultural yields in particular of more health sensitive crops like fruit vegetables and legumes said Dr Springmann. In the past there has been lots of invest in the stable grains like maize and corn but now we really need to move it to the crops we need more of. We also looked at increasing the efficiency of water use and we looked at better monitoring and recycling of fertiliser lots of it is lost and it runs off into rivers and causes dead zones in the oceans. In addition the study found that halving the amount of food lost to waste would reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture by 16. Tackling food loss and waste will require measures across the entire food chain from storage and transport over food packaging and labelling to changes in legislation and business behaviour that promote zero waste supply chains said Fabrice de Clerck director of science at EAT who funded the study. The key element is that these three solutions must be implemented together. Feeding a world population of 10 billion people is possible yet only if we change the way we eat and the way we produce food said Johan Rockstrm director designate of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research who is one of the authors of the study. All measures combined can result in keeping healthy both planet and people. The study has been published in the journal Nature.	True	False	False	True	False
According to data fromBrazils National Institute for Space Research NISR which monitors deforestation and wildfires around 74000 fires have occurred across the Amazon rainforest in 2019 an 84 percent increase from the same period in 2018. Macron took to Twitter on Thursday to express concern about the fires that have reached a record number this year devastating vast swathes of forest long described as the lungs of the earth. Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rain forest the lungs which produces 20 of our planets oxygen is on fire Macron wrote on Twitter. It is an international crisis. Members of the G7 Summit lets discuss this emergency first order in two days Meanwhile a spokesperson for the Elyse Palace said that in light of Brazils attitude these recent weeks Macron can only conclude that President Bolsonaro lied to him during the Osaka Summit in June where world leaders agreed on the urgent need to combat climate change pollution and environmental destruction. The decisions and statements from Brazil these recent weeks show clearly that President Bolsonaro has decided to not respect his commitments on the climate nor to involve himself on the issue of biodiversity the spokesperson said. As a consequence Macron now plans to veto any trade deal in its current state between the European Union and the Mercosur bloc of South American nations including Brazil Argentina Paraguay and Uruguay. Posting on Facebook Bolsonaro accused Macron of making personal political gains in an internal matter for Brazil and other Amazonian countries adding that the sensationalist tone he used does nothing to solve the problem. These countries that send money here they dont send it out of charity he said.They send it with the aim of interfering with our sovereignty. Yet amid rising international pressure the 63 year old former army captain reportedly signed an executive order deploying the military to help reduce the wildfires which he previously blamed on NGOs who were seeking to undermine his administration. On the question of burning in the Amazon which in my opinion may have been initiated by NGOs because they lost money what is the intention? Bolsonaro told reporters in Brasilia. Maybe I am not affirming it these NGOs are carrying out some criminal actions to draw attention against me against the government of Brazil. This is the war we are facing.	True	True	False	True	False
In a new study economist and environmental analyst Nicholas Loris explained that climate change simply isnt responsible for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Bottom line Loriss analysis stated that man made warming was not responsible forHarvey and Irma. Man made warming did not cause Harvey and Irma Loris wrote. As carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions have increased there have been no trends in global tropical cycle landfalls. Loris said that the average number of hurricanes per decade reaching landfall in the U.S. has fallen over the past 160 years. He added that the study is based on concrete mainstream science and cited reports from The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and NOAA to corroborate hisanalysis. Loris also disputedassertions that global warming supercharged these hurricanes which made them deadlier citing work by University of Washington climatologist Cliff Mass and former director of the National Hurricane Center Bill Read both of whom rejected this claim after conducting research into the phenomenon. With the eastern seaboard still in the thick of hurricane season as well asthe most recent devastation caused by Category 5 Hurricane Maria which was said to cripple Dominica with widespread devastation en route to Puerto Rico and possibly the States its important to maintainlevelheaded perspective and communication on natural disasters while speakingtruth amidstapprehension. In a hyper political environment pro climate change and anti climate change theory rhetoric serves only to distract from the real issue at hand the necessity of serving people impacted by natural disasters and the implementation ofstandardized response to these crises. While much of the media and government is ensconced in creating division among political parties and ideologies its more important to avoid playing into alarmist rhetoric whichonly serves to encourage people throughanxiety and panic. Instead of focusing on the apprehensionand divisiveness surrounding the causes of natural disasters its more important than ever that we maintain our humanity and come together tohelp one another.

Greta Thunberg tried really hard to keep her zero emissions promise but it has collapsed like all hypocritical left wing plans because it was just too difficult. From the Hill Greta Thunbergs plan for carbon free travel was contradicted when her sailboat captain flew across the Atlantic Ocean to pick her up. Thunberg 16 has been on a tour of North America to raise awareness for climate change. As part of her pledge to cut back carbon dioxide emissions to save the planet Thunberg vowed not to travel by air to limit her carbon footprint while she tours. The plan for zero emissions travel was subverted when Thunbergs yacht captain Nikki Henderson 26 flew to the United States from England burning roughly two or three tons of carbon CO2 in the process. Thunberg and her father who has traveled North America throughout his daughters activist tour could have flown aboard the same flight and burned just as much CO2. Ironically she failed because of left wing communist protesters in Chile Henderson was forced to make the flight last second because protests in Chile caused the U.N.s Cop25 climate summit to be moved to Madrid Spain. Thunberg was set to speak at the conference but needed to leave the U.S. sooner than expected. I mean you really think the entire world is going to come to a screeching halt for carbon emissions when you cant even organize a publicity stunt with your own standards? No wonder celebs opt to be complete and utter hypocrites instead of actually trying to get carbon neutral. And we all kinda see what is happening here if they cant do it now then why would we believe that they would be carbon free after they force all of us to live in backwards slums?

Brazil called up its military to combat fires that are raging in the Amazon after international protests over the governments seeming unwillingness to act in the face of an environmental disaster. Around 44000 troops and military aircraft will be made available for what has been described as an unprecedented effort to fight fires in at least six Brazilian states. It remains unclear how many of those troops will be put on the line to combat the forest fires. Although fires are common this time of year they are more widespread. So far nearly 77000 wildfires have been reported across the country this year which marked an 85 percent increase from the same period last year. And while the fires have been burning for weeks the international outcry grew this week as photographs spread on social media. Protests took place in Brazil and across the world Friday and Saturday demanding that the Brazilian government take action. Much of the attention has focused on Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro a long time critic of the countrys environmental regulations who had tried to minimize the effects of the fires. Yet his tune appeared to change after leaders in Europe said a major trade deal could be at risk and many on social media started calling for a boycott of Brazilian products. Bolsonaro approved the involvement of the military to help put out fires in a televised speech Friday in which he claimed his government would have zero tolerance for environmental crimes. Protecting the rain forest is our duty he said. That was quite a change in tune for a president who had previously described environmental protections as an impediment for economic growth and had blamed non governmental organizations of starting the fires. Yet despite the new found sense of urgency some are skeptical that the involvement of the military would really be able to do much. Once you have a huge forest fire like that especially when you dont have all the kind of forest fire fighting equipment that you have in places like the U.S. or Portugal its difficult to extinguish Alfredo Sirkis executive director of Brazil Climate Center a think tank said. Theyll only be extinguished by themselves depending on the weather conditions. It was clear though that deploying the military was also in part a public relations ploy. A military leader for example said that part of its mission involved creating a positive perception of the country. As attention focused on the fires burning in the Amazon it became clear that Europeans have taken the role as the global leaders in the fight against climate change notes the New York Times. As European leaders led by French President Emanuel Macron criticized Brazil for its inaction President Donald Trump waited until Friday evening to say that the United States was willing to help only to add that future trade prospects with Brazil are very exciting.

Leading climate scientists have warned that geoengineering research could be hijacked by climate change deniers as an excuse not to reduce CO2 emissions citing the US administration under Donald Trump as a major threat to their work. David Keith a solar geoengineering GE expert at Harvard University has said there is a real danger that his work could be exploited by those who oppose action on emissions at the same time as he defended himself and colleagues from the claims GE strengthens the argument for abandoning the targets set by the Paris climate agreement. One of the main concerns I and everyone involved in this have is that Trump might tweet geoengineering solves everything we dont have to bother about emissions. That would break the slow moving agreement among many environmental groups that sound research in this field makes sense Keith said on the sidelines of the Climate Engineering Conference CEC in Berlin. Indeed utterances from people in or close to the Trump administration most notably GE proponent secretary of state Rex Tillerson who has referred to climate change as just an engineering problem make it clear they either tacitly or directly support the idea of climate engineering. Earlier this year Keith a professor of applied physics at Harvard announced plans to conduct an outdoor trial into stratospheric aerosol injection involving launching a high altitude balloon that will spray a small quantity of reflective particles into the stratosphere. Keith believes the experiment may help to measure the feasibility and risks involved in GE an umbrella term for a range of techniques to deliberately adjust the climate in an effort to mitigate global warming. They include reflecting sunlight from space adding huge quantities of lime or iron to the oceans pumping deep cold nutrient rich waters to the surface of oceans and irrigating vast swaths of desert to grow trees. Supporters of research into geoengineering argue that its techniques roughly speaking divided into carbon dioxide removal CDR or negative emission technologies which removes greenhouse gases and solar radiation management SRM or solar geoengineering which reduces the amount of solar energy warming the planet could help to lessen some of the consequences of climate change. However the common consensus is that the techniques should be used in addition to reductions in CO2 emissions. This weeks conference drew attention to the huge risks involved. All the techniques being proposed have potentially severe environmental impacts said Silvia Ribeiro of the ETC Group leading campaign monitors of new technologies and their possible impact on the worlds poorest. They also ignore the question as to why theres not enough political will to have done more to tackle climate change until now and they in turn serve to justify the inaction she added. Concerns focus on techniques such as stratospheric aerosol injection which some experts say has the potential to reduce the amount of rain from Asian and African monsoons and could have a devastating impact on the food supply of billions of people. Aerosol injection also has the potential to reduce the ozone layer and heighten the risk of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Other possible side effects of GE may be an increase in ocean acidification a change in weather patterns a rapid rise in temperatures and a huge uptake in the use of agricultural land all of which could prompt mass migration of millions of climate change refugees. But scientists such as Keith and Mark Lawrence scientific director of the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies IASS in Potsdam argue that with the Paris agreement goals to limit temperature rise to two degrees or less almost impossible to achieve the world has little choice than to thoroughly explore technical intervention and the potential it has to avoid global disaster. It will be very difficult to achieve the Paris agreement calls without some form of climate engineering Lawrence said. Its not impossible but its hard to imagine we would make the major changes in our infrastructure and lifestyles in the time necessary. Keith also dismissed the view that climate engineers like himself were on a mission to prove that climate engineering worked at all costs or else see the importance of decades of their lifes work evaporate. At the best climate engineering is a supplement and it could be that we shouldnt do it he insisted. Our work is to inform better choices and it would actually be very useful to know for sure it didnt work. Right now there are heads of state and others in leadership who are explicitly assuming it could work that its there if we need it. But lets say we found something deep in the climate models which suggested we were overoptimistic about solar geoengineering then I would say abandon it. That would be great. Id love to publish that.

Alexandria Ocasio Cortez has found something else to blame on the supposed climate crisis. A few weeks ago she let us all know that heavy rain in a city built on a swamp was absolute proof of catastrophic global warming. She posted a picture of a few inches of water and called it unprecedented flooding even though Washington D.C. has had actual major floods several times throughout its relatively short history. Then there was the explosion at an oil refinery which despite not being a weather event at all nor being caused by one was somehow the fault of climate change. Weird how everything just so happens to reinforce her political narrative and now shes back with another hot take. You see it rained in New York City and that was obviously caused by global warming. Did it rain a lot? No not really. There was no record rainfall or a weeks worth of severe storms. It justrained something it has presumably been doing there for millions of years. In reality New York Citys subway system is a dumpster fire of mismanagement. The citys communist Mayor Bill de Blasio has run it into the ground with stupid financial decisions and misuse of funds. You see theyve got money to pay for illegal aliens healthcare but they cant keep the trains running or the sewage systems from backing up. The flooding in this case wasnt because of a massive downpour. It was because the infrastructure is falling apart. If a pipe bursts in your house thats not the fault of climate change. On a broader note Im confused. What happened to climate change leading to massive desertification and droughts? Now the alarmists want to complain about rain and flooding as if those are new phenomenons on the earth? Wouldnt those be good things in the face of supposed extreme heat? But making sense isnt a tenant of the climate religion. Ive got a new twitter! Please help by following 	True	False	False	True	False
Unchecked climate change will cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars and damage human health and quality of life a US government report warns. Future risks from climate change depend... on decisions made today the 4th National Climate Assessment says. The report says climate change is presenting growing challenges to human health and safety quality of life and the rate of economic growth. The warning is at odds with the Trump administration's fossil fuels agenda. During a blast of icy weather in Washington this week Donald Trump tweeted whatever happened to global warming? Now without mentioning the president his own scientists have answered their boss's question in comprehensive detail. Global warming is here in the United States they say now. It is already deadly serious and without urgent dramatic change it will be catastrophic. This report is striking for two reasons. First it is not abstract. It gives many specific examples overwhelmed dams in South Carolina failing crops in the parched Great Plains a rise in insect borne disease in Florida. And secondly it majors on the economic impact in effect challenging the White House's insistence on prioritising economic growth over environmental regulation. With warnings about the effects on crumbling infrastructure falling crop yields and decreasing labour productivity the report sounds an alarm that climate change will soon cascade into every corner of American life. The White House said the report compiled with help from numerous US government agencies and departments was inaccurate. Spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said it was largely based on the most extreme scenario which contradicts long established trends by assuming that... there would be limited technology and innovation and a rapidly expanding population. The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is human induced and warn that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity. The US climate assessment outlines the prospective impacts of climate change across every sector of American society. With continued growth in emissions at historic rates annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century more than the current gross domestic product GDP of many US states the report says. Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century. The report notes that the effects of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country including more frequent and intense extreme weather and climate related events. But it says that projections of future catastrophe could change if society works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur. Environmental groups said the report underlined their demands for action. Brenda Ekwurzel director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists and one of the report's authors said the report made it clear that climate change was not some problem in the distant future. It's happening right now in every part of the country she said. That view was echoed by Abigail Dillen president of environmental group Earthjustice. While President Trump continues to ignore the threat of climate change his own administration is sounding the alarm she said. In October President Trump accused climate change scientists of having a political agenda telling Fox News he was unconvinced that humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures. After taking office he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures well below 2C above pre industrial levels. At the time Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new fair deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers. During his election campaign in 2016 Mr Trump said climate change was a hoax. However he has since rowed back on that statement saying in a recent interview I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference. A report released in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC the leading international body evaluating climate change said it could only be stopped if the world made major and costly changes. That means reducing global emissions of CO2 by 45 from 2010 levels by 2030 and reducing coal use to almost zero and using up to seven million sq km 2.7 million square miles for land energy crops. If the world fails to act the researchers warned there would be some significant and dangerous changes to our world including rising sea levels significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity and the ability to grow crops such as rice maize and wheat.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his climate change minister Catherine McKenna are both disappointed over President Donald Trumps decision to break with the Paris climate accord. Trudeau and Trump exchanged words over the phone on Thursday night when the prime minister expressed his disappointment with the presidents decision according to a news release from the Prime Ministers Office. Through crestfallen Trudeau reiterated to the president Canadas continued commitment to working internationally to address climate change. This is about an ambitious and unshakable desire to leave a cleaner healthier and more sustainable planet for our kids and for generations to come. Despite the lofty objectives when Trudeau signed the Paris accord he was widely criticized in Canada by environmentalists for selling out to an agreement that they said was far too lenient on greenhouse gas producers. Nonetheless Liberal Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna also found Trumps resolve to extricate the U.S. from the accord deeply disappointing and even suggested that the president will be missing out from the inevitable increase in green energy jobs that climate change proponents believe will soon be mushrooming around the world. The clean growth economy is where the world is going and Canada is going to be part of it McKenna said Thursday on Parliament Hill. Canada wants to create good jobs and wants to grow our economy and create opportunities for business. We want to be there we want to be providing solutions for the world. We know where were going. However the U.S. move might well affect Trudeaus plans to implement a national carbon tax and his overall environmental agenda that many critics say will make the Canadian economy less competitive than its American counterpart. With the North American Free Trade Agreement on the cusp of renegotiation environmental policy could well become integral to reaching a new agreement.	True	False	False	True	True
The EPAs announcement makes no mention of the risks coal ash poses to human health and the environment. Rather the agency justified its move by noting it is expected to save the utility sector between 31 and 100 million annually. Todays coal ash proposal embodies EPAs commitment to our state partners by providing them with the ability to incorporate flexibilities into their coal ash permit programs based on the needs of their states Pruitt said in a statement. Coal fired power plants in the United States produce roughly 140 million tons of coal ash per year containing toxic heavy metals such as arsenic lead selenium and other carcinogenic substances. The waste product is typically stored in wet ponds nearly 46 percent of which operated without liners to prevent hazardous chemicals from seeping into groundwater according to 2012 data released by the EPA. Living within a mile of a wet coal ash storage pond poses a greater health threat than smoking a pack of cigarettes a day raising the risk of cancer to one in 50 an EPA study from 2010 found. Children are particularly at risk of learning disabilities birth defects asthma and cancer with 1.54 million living near such storage sites according to EPA data cited by the Sierra Club. This is the second biggest toxic pollution threat in our country and we need to clean it up not make things easier for polluters Earthjustice attorney Lisa Evans said in a statement. People living near more than a thousand toxic coal ash sites are at risk. They face contaminated drinking water toxic dust in the air and serious health threats just because the EPA is choosing to side with polluters over the public. In 2014 the EPA catalogued 158 cases where coal ash compromised water quality including 22 that involved recycled waste product. And a government study in 2012 estimated that the damage to fish and wildlife at 21 disposal sites came at a cost of more than 2.3 billion enough money to construct 155 landfills with state of the art composite liners and leachate collection systems. The rule change marks the Trump administrations latest rollback of clean water regulations at a time when drinking water contamination crises are proliferating across the country. In February 2017 less than a month after taking office President Donald Trump signed a bill to allow coal companies to dump waste into streams. In June the EPA moved to repeal the 2015 Waters of the U.S. rule that extended 1972 Clean Water Act protections to roughly 20 million acres of wetlands and streams. The agency formally suspended the rule on Jan. 31. Scrapping the only federal rules on coal ash presents a major problem in the face of storms floods and other extreme weather made more frequent and intense by climate change. When Hurricane Maria made landfall over Puerto Rico last year flood waters swelled the river in the city of Guayama wreaking havoc on the citys 42000 residents and distributing its five story tall tower of coal ash. Coal ash in particular has long been a hot button issue in the utility industry. In 2014 Duke Energy one of the countrys biggest power companies spilled nearly 39000 tons of coal ash into the Dan River causing one of North Carolinas biggest environmental disasters in its history. In 2016 then Gov. Pat McCrory R signed a bill that dramatically watered down legislation forcing Duke to clean up its coal ash pits without requiring the company to excavate the waste or provide clean water to residents near the pond. Yet two years later the company is still battling environmentalists and regulators in the state as the utility seeks to pass the cleanup costs onto ratepayers in the form of a price hike. In a separate legal fight over coal ash the Tennessee Valley Authority the nations biggest public utility last month appealed a federal judges order to clean up decades of coal ash environmentalists say poisoned water in the Volunteer State. Eighteen states and an alliance of big corporate interests urged an appeals court to overturn the decision last month. Gutting the EPAs rules on coal ash pollution takes some pressure off the utilities but thrusts the industry back into the sort of regulatory uncertainty Pruitt vowed to alleviate. In 2014 before the EPA passed its coal ash rule the American Coal Ash Association a trade group complained about regulatory uncertainty that has impeded the beneficial use of coal ash for half a decade. Its unclear whether Pruitts new rule promotes recycling coal ash for other uses. Coal ash can be used to pave roads though the environmentalists say even that poses pollution risks. And last year Purdue University researchers announced new technology to sift rare earth elements highly valued components used in electronics and renewable energy hardware out of coal ash waste. Thomas Adams executive director of the American Coal Ash Association said he hopes the next part of the EPAs announcement will include changing a rule that mandates companies to go through a risk evaluation when stockpiling more than 12400 tons of coal ash for anything other than road projects. The EPA set the threshold in 2015 based on what Adams called an arithmetic error that he argued hurts the market for using coal ash in cement manufacturing or to fill structures such as building foundations. He said he hopes the EPA will raise the limit to 75000 tons. Thursdays announcement is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to end a perceived war on coal waged by the Obama administration. Last year the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group petitioned the EPA to roll back the Obama era coal ash rule calling it burdensome inflexible and often impracticable. The organization of some 80 utilities warned that regulating coal ash disposal would result in significant economic and operational impacts to coal fired power generation and could even force power plants to shut down.

Biden took questions from a group in New Castle New Hampshire Friday. One woman associated with the environmental group 350 New Hampshire Action Rebecca Beaulieu asked Biden how voters can trust him if he continues to associate himself with fossil fuel executives. How can we trust that youre going to act on climate on the climate crisis if youre still attending fundraisers that fossil fuel executives are attending? Beaulieuasked according to the Daily Mail. Video shows Biden walking over to the woman taking her hand and making a solemn promise to end fossil fuel before 2050 God willing. Kiddo I want you to just take a look. I want you to look into my eyes Biden began. I guarantee you I guarantee you we are going to end fossil fuel and I am not going to cooperate with them. Before 2050 God willing Biden continued adding that 2030 is not a realistic goal No it cant be done by 2030. No not one single person is arguing it can be done by that. But it can be done by 2050. Maybe 2045? And is the science increases we may be able to move more quickly. But we have to we can fundamentally change things in the next 10 years though so that we set a path? I promise you I promise you. OK. Beaulieu 24 said she wasnt expecting that kind of response from Biden and described it as patronizing. Just a little patronizing because I want to be an adult at the table when it comes to conversations about climate and what were going to do about it and I dont want to be like someone whos sitting on the sidelines waiting for other people to act she said according to the Daily Mail. Im also like actively doing something to try to combat this climate crisis as it stands. Being called a kid is a little patronizing when Im trying to do so much work she added. She also said she was unsatisfied with Bidens refusal to bend his 2050 goal. But I hope that he takes the climate crisis as seriously as he tried to make it seem and that if hes going to keep moving forward with his plans he needs to reevaluate because 2050 is too late she said. Biden recently came under fire for attending a fundraiser hosted by Andrew Goldman a founder of the natural gas company Western LNG. The former vice president dismissed concerns telling viewers of CNNs climate change town hall Wednesday that Goldman is not a fossil fuel executive. He is not a fossil fuel executive Biden said. And the fact of the matter is that what we talk about is what are we going to do about those corporations? What have we done? And everywhere along the way for example Ive argued and pushed for us suing those executives who are engaged in pollution those companies engaged in pollution he added. Ive never walked away from that.	False	False	False	False	True
The generation that has grown up with the constant drumbeat of manmade climate change is now shaping public policy including some young conservatives who have launched a nationwide campaign in support of a carbon tax. The Thomson Reuters Foundation reported on the campaign which runs counter to the stance of the Republican Party and President Donald Trump that the issue is more about globalization than saving the planet Drawn from Republican groups on more than two dozen university campuses the Young Conservatives for Carbon Dividends called for laws to tax oil natural gas and coal producers of planet warming greenhouse gases. The taxation plan would make fossil fuels more costly while the resulting revenues would go to taxpayers. We claim to be the party that cares about the future that our children will inherit and we need climate policy that reflects that said Kiera OBrien 21 a senior at Harvard University who co founded the group. We are offering up what we see as the common sense solution and the way forward for the party OBrien said in the Reuters article. The article pointed out that Trump has rejected the climate doomsday scenario and has instead acted to help the U.S. energy sector by slashing regulations and withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord both policies aimed at helping American workers and the economy. The college Republicans behind the carbon tax campaign said the Party should have ahead of the 2020 election a climate change plan in place. Their plan includes an initial 40 a ton tax on carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas at mines wells and ports where products are produced. That tax rate would increase over time according to Reuters. OBrien said the plan includes a family of four receiving 2000 a year from the carbon tax revenues to help with higher energy costs. The plan harnesses the power of the free market to solve climate change through innovation OBrien said. Our plan would provide incentives for companies and individuals to lower emissions in ways they think are best. The campaign will connect young conservatives with Republican lawmakers around the country to talk about climate policy. At least one older Republican backs the idea. The key here is the dividend back to the people former Sen. Trent Lott R MS who supports the young group told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Its not sustainable for Republicans through the leadership to say We just dont want to talk about this' Lott said.	False	False	False	False	False
Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortezs claim the world is gonna end in 12 years shouldnt come as a shock to anyone because shes only repeating the same doomsday narrative pushed by some scientists and news outlets for months. In fact Ocasio Cortez followed up her remarks from Monday night with acoupletweetsdoubling down on her 12 year warning but also showing she didnt make it up. The freshman Democrat pointed to a Voxarticlewarning we have just 12 years to limit devastating global warming and a Guardianarticleclaiming we have 12 years to limit climate change catastrophe both articles were based on a United Nations report from October 2018. That U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC report examined what would need to be done in order to limit future global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100. The report was mandated by the Paris climate accord. The IPCC reported greenhouse gas emissions would need to fall 45 percent below 2010 levels by 2030 and then reach zero by 2050 for a 66 percent chance of keeping projected warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.RELATED Another Headline Grabbing Ocean Warming Study Is Full Of Factual Errors And Misleading Statements Scientist Says And in the months since that report news has been inundated with headlines warning its worse than we thought or the worlds ice sheets are reaching a tipping point. Themost widely reported climate studyin 2018warned we were on track for a hothouse Earth. Nearly ever natural disaster in 2018 were tied to global warming in some way from Californiasdevastating wildfirestohurricanesFlorence and Michael. All the news stories stressing climate alarm spurred calls for action on global warming. However many experts looking at the IPCCs report saw it asinfeasible to completely overhaul the global ecologyin 12 years and there are serious questions about the accuracy of U.N. climate models. Yet IPCC report authorsframedthis as a problem of political will not economics and technology. The report itself says there is no documented historic precedent for the sweeping changes needed to fight global warming. Thats the line activists and many politicians have taken up in the months since the IPCCs report. Indeed Ocasio Cortez saidglobal warming is her generations World War II. And what preceded World War II? The New Deal. Ocasio Cortez nowwants a Green New Dealto move the U.S. away from fossil fuels and address a variety of injustices she sees in our current economic system. And I think for younger people looking at this are more like how are we saying lets take it easy when 3000 Americans died last year how are we saying lets take it easy when the end person died from our cruel and unjust criminal justice system?

In its first year in office the Trump administration introduced a solitary new environmental rule aimed at protecting the public from pollution. It was aimed not at sooty power plants or emissions intensive trucks but dentists. Every year dentists fill Americans tooth cavities with an amalgam that includes mercury. About 5 tons of mercury a dangerous toxin that can taint the brain and the nervous system are washed away from dental offices down drains each year. In Trumps first day in the White House the administration told the Environmental Protection Agency EPA to withdraw an Obama era plan that would require dentists to prevent this mercury from getting into waterways. But in June the rule was unexpectedly enacted. This apparent change of heart followed legal action filed by green groups part of a cascade of courtroom standoffs that are starting to slow and even reverse the Trump administrations blitzkrieg of environmental regulations. The Trump administration has been sloppy and careless theyve shown significant disrespect for rule of law and courts have called them on it said Richard Revesz a professor at the New York University school of law. I expect we will see a number of further losses for the administration on similar grounds. If they keep showing the same disregard for the law their attempt to repeal all these environmental regulations will go badly for them. The reversal of Obamas environmental legacy has been spearheaded by Scott Pruitt who heads the EPA the agency he repeatedly sued as Oklahoma attorney general. Pruitt who accused Obama of bending the rule of law and federal overreach has overseen the methodical delay or scrapping of dozens of rules curbing pollution from power plants pesticides and vehicles. Ironically for Pruitt who has touted a back to basics approach rooted safely within the confines of the law this rapidly executed agenda has run into a thicket of legal problems causing the administration to admit defeat in several cases. In July a federal court ruled that the EPA couldnt suspend rules designed to curb methane emissions from new oil and gas wells. This was followed by a hasty retreat in August when the EPA agreed to not delay new standards to reduce smog causing air pollutants the day after 15 states and environment groups sued. Then in December a federal court told the EPA it couldnt delay a new standard for dangerous levels of lead in paint and dust. Other arms of the federal government have also been stymied from implementing Trumps deregulatory agenda. The US Fish and Wildlife Service stung by a lawsuit listed the rusty patched bumblebee as endangered in March after initially delaying the decision. And on Thursday a federal court told the department of energy it must implement four energy efficiency regulations it was looking to scuttle. Many of these legal problems have stemmed from the sheer pace of the rollbacks required public comment periods have been set aside in some cases any rationale for repeal or delay has been missing in others. Opponents of the administration also believe there is a determination to expunge every vestige of Obamas environmental legacy regardless of merit. They are trying to score political points or attempting to grant favours to corporations who dont want to follow the rules said Aaron Colangelo the litigation director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. It all shows that this administration wont protect the environment unless they are sued. They have been reckless and not followed the basic requirements of the law. The EPA now faces a fresh wave of opposition as it looks to craft replacements for major Obama rules such as the clean power plan which sought to limit emissions from coal fired power plants and the waters of the US rule which greatly expanded clean water protections. If the proposed replacements are as expected far less onerous on industry than current iterations environmentalists and around a dozen states headed by New York and California will be poised to further jam up the process in the courts. Over and over again the Trump administration has put the profits of multinational polluters over the health and well being of everyday Americans said Eric Schneiderman New Yorks attorney general. Schneiderman has been prolific in opposing Trumps environmental revisions filing more than 50 lawsuits during the administrations first year to among other things protect the clean power plan enforce stricter vehicle pollution standards and ensure that chlorpyrifos a common pesticide linked to neurological harm to children is banned. Weve already beaten back several of this administrations toxic policies from energy efficiency rollbacks to smog Schneiderman said. Our fight to protect public health and our environment will continue in court.	True	False	False	True	True
It was clear Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke felt at home Tuesday addressing representatives of the industry that was a top donor to his congressional campaigns. Its the same industrythat the Trump administration has worked so hard to prop up over the last two years and that Zinke now regulates as chief steward of Americas natural resources. I see a lot of familiar faces he told the National Petroleum Council during its meeting in Washington D.C. before launching into a series of go to talking points about the importance of producing domestic energy namely fossil fuels and downplaying the dire conclusions of a recent federal climate report. We want to embrace better stewardship. We want to embrace reliability. In order to get there we have to understand the technology. And in order to understand it quite frankly we have to work with you he said. Ive been criticized for saying we want to work with you. Ill take the criticism. Zinke was referring to controversial comments he made in September during a keynote speech at the Louisiana Oil and Gas Associations meeting in Lafayette Louisiana. Our government should work for you he told the oil and gas trade group according to a post by the association. As head of the Interior Department Zinke oversees some 500 million acres of land or one fifth of the United States and 1.7 billion acres on the Outer Continental Shelf. Its a job that comes with the sometimes conflicting tasks of preserving and protecting public lands and waters for future generations while also setting the policies that govern extracting natural resources from them. Zinke has said that hes succeeded in striking the right balance but conservation efforts have taken a clear backseat as the administration has pushed forward with its energy dominance agenda. There were moments during Tuesdays speech where Zinke sounded like a seasoned oil man. He said he is bullish on energy and expects that within two years the U.S. will be marching real close to producing 14 million barrels of oil per day. And he agrees with Russian President Vladimir Putin that 60 per barrel is a good spot to keep the economic engine in good shape he said. Weve gotten a lot better as industry Zinke said quickly correcting himself. Youve gotten a lot better. He pointed to energy producers success with domestic shale production noting that companies have been able to turn a profit on oil from the Bakken fields in Montana and North Dakota when prices have been at around 30 per barrel. That he said shows you how good we are and efficient we are. Zinke also saw the friendly atmosphere as an opportunity to once again cast doubt on the latest federal climate assessment. The 1600 page report was issued by 13 federal agencies including Interior and released on Black Friday the day after Thanksgiving a move that many saw as an administrative attempt to bury the findings. Like so many other climate reports before it the assessment warns that greenhouse gas emissions have put the planet on a path toward catastrophic climate change. But instead of blasting the reports authors there are more than 300 for basing their findings on the most extreme scenarios a false claim that he and the White House pushed last week Zinke on Tuesday blamed the media among other targets. The media focused on worst case scenarios which statistically we may not even be able to reach he said. The facts of the matter is observable data climate change is more toward the peace time he added comparing the document to international relations. Its kind of like the military he said. Theres peace time and theres global nuclear combat. The media focused on global nuclear combat. A lot of the millennials look at that report and they dont look at the models instead focusing on rising sea levels that statistically and data wise we dont know he said. Zinke boasted to the room full of oil executives who have been primary beneficiaries of the Trump administrations denial of climate science and energy dominance agenda that the U.S. has led the charge in reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. His concern as the leader of the federal agency he said is that we need to be better at emphasizing the case for American energy.	False	False	False	True	True
He refused to call the rapid warming of the planet a crisis. He repeatedly misrepresented his own agencys findings about a rule to gut an Obama era power plant regulation inflating the emissions cuts the new proposal would mandate. He even mixed up two of the most important climate science reports to come out in the last three months admitting he hadnt fully read the report co authored by researchers at his own agency. It was a brazen if not unexpected stance from the nominee to become the EPAs 15th administrator. Wheeler isnt new to the job Last month he became the longest serving acting chief in the agencys history having taken over in July when former Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in disgrace amid mounting scandals. In November 2017 when he appeared before the Senate environment and public works committee to interview for the EPAs No. 2 job Wheeler said he believed that man has an impact on the climate but whats not completely understood is what the impact is. In October the United Nations released a landmark determination that the world has until 2030 to halve global emissions or face catastrophic climate change. A month later the federal governments National Climate Assessment a congressionally mandated report issued by 13 agencies including the EPA confirmed the findings and warned of cataclysmic damage to the United States economy and human health and by 9F 5C or more by the end of this century. During Wednesdays hearing Wheeler initially mistook the United Nations report for the National Climate Assessment. Asked about the latter he said he did not review the report before it came out and that he held just one briefing meeting with his career staffers. He said the partial federal government shutdown now its fourth week forced him to delay future briefings. Wheeler dismissed thereportthis month that found U.S. emissions rose 3.4 percent last year blaming the jump on a manufacturing and industrial surge triggered by the Trump administrations deregulatory effort. But he claimed his proposals to dramatically weaken emissions rules for vehicles and power plants the largest and second largest sources of climate pollution respectively would provide reductions in line with the Obama era regulations they aim to replace. When pressed about the need to cut emissions Wheeler returned to a certain statistic over and over again stating that the Affordable Clean Energy rule he proposed in August would deliver carbon dioxide reductions 34 percent below 2005 levels compared to the 33 to 35 percent the Obama administrations Clean Power Plan would have provided. This is a fudged statistic however. The EPAsown analysisshows the so called ACE rule would actually increase CO2 emissions by 20 to 61 million tons nitrous oxide by 14000 to 43000 tons and sulfur dioxide by 29000 to 53000 tons. Those increases are expected to cause up to1400 premature deathsper year by 2030. Wheelers climate denial received some backup at Wednesdays hearing. Sen. James Inhofe R Okla. who once infamously brought a snowball to the Senate floor to debunk climate change submitted rebuttals to climate science reports from right wing think tanks such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Cato Institute both of which are funded by the fossil fuel billionaire Koch brothers. Wheeler blamed the shutdown for the delay in releasing a plan to deal with toxic perfluorinated substances in drinking water. Over the past few years the chemicals known as PFAS and linked to cancer and thyroid disease have been found in water sources across the country. Wheeler however declined to commit to a two year deadline for setting a drinking water standard for PFAS. Republican senators praised Wheelers proposal to replace another Obama era rule that sought to safeguard drinking water for millions of Americans by extending federal protections to 2 million miles of streams and 20 million acres of wetlands. Sen. Dan Sullivan R Alaska even prompted Wheeler with a question about his nearly two decades working for Bob Murray the influential and bombastic baron who runs the nations largest privately owned coal company. Wheeler used his response to note that the last four years of his time working for Murray were spent advocating for miners pensions. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse D R.I. brought out some visual aids to question Wheeler further about his relationship with Murray including a poster sized printout of a photo leaked from a March 2017 meeting between Murray and Energy Secretary Rick Perry where the coal executive provided a detailed wish list of policies to the administration. That meeting ended as another photo showed with a hug between Perry and Murray. Wheeler is seen sitting beside Murray in the picture.	True	False	False	True	False
CNN The acting director of the federal agency responsible for managing one in every 10 acres of land in the United States has repeatedly denied the existence of climate change and falsely claimed in a 1990s speech there was no credible evidence of a hole in the ozone layer. William Perry Pendley was appointed by Interior Secretary David Bernhardt as the acting director of the Department of Interior's Bureau of Land Management in July 2019. Prior to his appointment Pendley was a conservative activist commentator lawyer and served as the longtime president of the conservative Mountain States Legal Foundation. Despite the total absence of credible scientific evidence the media is convinced and is attempting to convince us that we have global warming an Ozone hole and acid rain and that it is all man's fault Pendley said in a 1992 speech to the Heritage Foundation. In other comments uncovered during a CNN KFile review of his social media activity writings and public appearances Pendley cited an anti Muslim figure to claim Islam was at war with the United States compared undocumented immigrants to cancer and blamed them for diseases. Asked about his comments and if he still holds his views Pendley said his views were being taken out of context and were irrelevant to his role at BLM. As someone in the public arena for nearly four decades I've given countless statements and written scores of articles on a wide variety of topics. Cherrypicking a few of them out of context is neither useful nor connected to my current position. I'm focused now on implementing the policy priorities of the Trump administration and Secretary Bernhardt within the authorities and mission given this agency by Congress. My personal views are irrelevant in this context. 'Environmentalism' is indeed the last refuge of the left the last safe haven for those who trust not the people but big government those who seek to place the power in the hands of federal bureaucrats Pendley said. No wonder the environmental message has became the cause of choice for the elitists of Hollywood. It should not surprise us that they have embraced environmentalism with the same self righteous fervor as they once embraced socialism and communism. Despite the total absence of credible scientific evidence the media is convinced and is attempting to convince us that we have global warming an Ozone hole and acid rain and that it is all man's fault he added. Pendley has repeatedly denied the existence of climate change and mocked the scientific consensus around environmental issues as rooted in bad science. I debated an environmentalist on television here in Denver and and it's he she was quoting people about global warming and I said you realize the people you're quoting just a couple of years ago were predicting global cooling on a massive scale that we would not be able to feed ourselves. And it stopped her for just a second Pendley said. And then she said 'Well it's going to be something.' And that's what the environmentalists say. It's going to be something to quote another movie from the movie The Fly 'Be afraid be very afraid.' And that's what they're preaching. They're preaching fear. At times Pendley's denial of climate change has drifted into even more fringe claims linking the broader US environmental movement to the fall of the Soviet Union and communism. Because of the collapse of communism because the wall has come down because the Soviet Union is no more...the environmental movement is the last refuge of people who favor government over people he said. Who knew? Islam's war with America started just up the road in Greeley Colorado! Pendley tweeted. In the article Spencer floats unfounded conspiracies about leftists allying with Islamic hardliners who adhere to Sharia a system of laws that would have many of them executed. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and President Barack Obama think if one can call it thinking or anything more than wishful thinkingthat Americans should be afraid of terrorist attacks not from all those who embrace radical Islam but from their countrymen who hold very strong views on important issues of the day? Pendley wrote. Pendley has repeatedly used extreme rhetoric to refer to undocumented immigrants. You see the problems Hazleton or Valley Park faces could be in your community next because illegal immigration is spreading like a cancer Pendley wrote. Partly this is because Mexico and some other governments promote and encourage illegal immigration into our country. Pendley went on to say if massive immigration continued you and I will permanently lose the country we love Frustrated by the failure of the federal government to address the issue of illegal immigration and the problems it poses for the tiny cash strapped city including violent crime crowded schools hospital costs and the demand for servicesthe City Council at the request of Mayor Lou Barletta adopted legislation to deal with these problems. Violent crimeincluding dangerous gangs over crowded schools the appearance of diseases once vanquished from the western world escalating hospital costs and an overwhelming demand for government services! Pendley wrote. These are the new problems being faced by small cash strapped cities and towns all across America. The source illegal immigrants.	False	False	False	True	True
In an interview on MSNBC on Thursday former Secretary of State John Kerry said President Donald Trumps decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord puts America last is shameful and will hurt kids by worsening their asthma. It is a shameful moment for the United States to have unilaterally walked away from an agreement which did not have one other country requiring us to do something Kerry told Andrea Mitchell. It was a voluntary program The president was not truthful with the American people today and the president who talked about putting America first has now put America last. Kerry claimed Trump is not helping the forgotten American. Trump is not helping the forgotten American Kerry said. He is hurting them. Their kids will have worse asthma in the summer. They will have a harder time having economic growth. Hes made us an environmental pariah in the world and I think it is one of the most self destructive moves Ive ever seen by any president in my lifetime. Kerrys primary arguments that Trumps decision will hurt kids with asthma and damage the economy were incredibly misleading. A 2015 study by researcher Dr. Corrine Keet at Johns Hopkins Children Center found no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of asthma for kids living in inner city areas where there is much more air pollution and kids who live in the suburbs and rural areas. More than 23000 children were included in the study. Daniel Simmons the vice president for policy at the Institute for Energy Research noted in a quote appearing in an article by EE News that asthma rates have been steadily worsening even though air quality has been improving. Air quality has been increasing pollution has been decreasing things are getting better and asthmas getting worse Simmons said. You have this disconnect. In 2013 USA Today reported that Earths warming climate has caused pollen season to increase thereby exacerbating many peoples asthma. If climate change is being caused by human produced carbon dioxide this could lend support to Kerrys claim about asthma. Of course scientists disagree over what has caused Earths climate to warm over the past century and perhaps most importantly increased pollen comesfrom increased plant growth and as a result increased crop yields. Should more plants and food for people and animals really be demonized? Kerrys argument that Trumps decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement will cause economic problems is equally absurd. Kerry cited in the interview the millions of renewable energy jobs that have been created to help curb carbon dioxide emissions as an example of how the Paris Agreement and its associated efforts would have a positive impact on the economy but the truth is that the only reason the wind and solar energy industries have been able to survive is because they are heavily subsidized by taxpayers. Further wind and solar are much more expensive forms of energy which means Americans power bills would continue to rise under the terms of the Paris Climate Agreement. As H. Sterling Burnett a research fellow in climate and energy issues for The Heartland Institute where I also work as executive editor and a research fellow noted in a recent article on Trumps decision Numerous studies including a NERA Economic Consulting report cited in Trumps announcement showed meeting the carbon dioxide targets imposed on the United States under the Paris agreement would force the premature closing of many of the nations least expensive power plants. NERA estimated meeting the nations obligations under the agreement would cost the U.S. economy nearly 3 trillion and by 2040 the United States would have lost 6.5 million industrial sector jobs including 3.1 million manufacturing jobs.

Last week week a routine entry in the searchable database at the website of the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources indicated that the Dakota Access Pipeline saw an 84 gallon crude oil spill in April. The environmental Left rushed to publicize the incident as an I told you so moment but activists gloating reveals either their cynical dishonesty or their ignorance about how modern pipelines work. The spill occurred in an Energy Transfer Partners facility specifically equipped to catch spills. Moreover the precautions in place to prevent environmental damage worked exactly as they should according to the South Dakota Department of Environment and National Resources. As spills go this spill was contained all product was cleaned up quickly and there were no impacts to the environment Kim Smith a spokesperson for the South Dakota department told me. The containment system and notification system worked as they should. Compare that to the hysterical reaction from leftist activists and their media allies. Writing in the Guardian opinionist Julian Brave NoiseCat said that the leak demonstrates the risk of technological and human failure inherent in crude oil pipelines adding that indigenous communities ranchers and workers are forced to live under the constant threat of petroleum poisoning. Jan Hasselman a lawyer for the Standing Rock Sioux told the Huffington Post They keep telling everybody that it is state of the art that leaks wont happen that nothing can go wrong. Its always been false. They havent even turned the thing on and its shown to be false. And a Clean Technica reporter claimed the incident drives home an essential truth about all the systems mankind has devised to transport oil from place to placeaddingThey all leak. Somewhere somehow the vile stuff gets out and when it does it causes untold damage to the environment. Such biased narratives have bedeviled the Dakota Access Pipeline from the beginning. National media readily adopted opponents preferred rhetoric in articles calling demonstrators the water protectors and repeating their claims that the protests were peaceful and prayerful. In actuality the protests were anything but peaceful as we reported at the time. Local authorities struggled to respond as demonstrators resorted to violence and vandalism. Protestors reportedly threw Molotov cocktails and stones at law enforcement also threatening police and their families and posting their home addresses online. Local ranchers said protestors trespassed on their land and damaged their property. By the time the protests ended hundreds had been arrested. These facts received little coverage the media instead portraying a David and Goliath fight in which virtuous protesters took on a corrupt wealthy industry. And while the Left likes to accuse conservatives of being anti science it hasignored any evidence that doesnt support itsanti pipeline agenda. Comprehensive environmental reviews conducted under the Obama administration showed the risk posed by Keystone XL and the Dakota Access Pipeline to be minimal. But some of the same environmentalists who denounced Trump for moving ahead with the pipelines also rushed to participate in the March for Science. Green activists have also spent the last year publicizing scary statistics about oil pipelines. But just as with the recent Dakota Access Pipeline spill the reality is less convenient for their political preferences. Cutting edge technology such as the containment system installed at the pump station in Tulare S.D. means that its safer than ever to transport oil by pipeline. The Fraser Institute a Canadian free market think tank analyzed U.S. State Department data finding that 70 percent of spills that have occurred in North America were a cubic meter or less hardly the massive leakage environmentalists have implied. Moreover the Fraser Institute found that only 17 percent of spills take place along the pipelines route the rest occurring in facilities such as the Tulare pump station which are specially equipped to safely handle spills and avoid environmental contamination. Overall the number of pipeline incidents in which people or the environment were harmed has dropped by more than 50 percent since 1999 even as the United States saw its energy production skyrocket. The outcome of the Dakota Access Pipeline spill was a technological triumph that should reassure its skeptics. The pipelines opponents are trying to spin it into a cautionary tale. In doing so they reveal their own selective adherence to scientific reason. Jillian Kay Melchior is a fellow at the Independent Womens Forum.	False	False	False	True	True
Congressional Republicans have opened an investigation into a second U.S. based environmental group over its ties to the Chinese government. Top Republicans on the House Natural Resources Committee asked the World Resources Institute WRI an environmental advocacy group to turn over documents related to its work with Chinese officials and their advocacy in the U.S. Lawmakers want to know if WRIs desire to maintain good relations with the Chinese is affecting the groups U.S. operations and advocacy effectively making it a foreign agent of the communist government. WRIs desire to maintain access to Chinese officials may influence its political activities in the United States Republican Reps. Rob Bishop of Utah and Bruce Westermanof Arkansaswrote in a letter to WRI President Andrew Steer sent Wednesday. Given WRIs close ties to the Chinese government its emphasis on cultivating contacts with various U.S. officials is particularly disconcerting in light of the government partnerships and environmental initiatives involving WRI during the Obama Administration they wrote. RELATED NYT Suggests Global Warming Is To Blame For Roger Federers US Open Defeat Since President Trumps election WRI political activities have turned to influencing state and municipal governments the lawmakers wrote. In at least one governors office WRI has embedded a senior environmental adviser and appears to exercise a high level of control of the governments environmental agenda. WRI describes itself as a nonprofit global research organization that operates in more than 60 countries including China. WRI played a role in the Paris Agreement negotiations in 2015 and praised China for its pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Chinas Paris accord pledge however has been criticized by experts who saw it as nothing more than promising to continue current economic trends. WRI opposed President Donald Trumps decision to leave the Paris accord in 2017 in a statement that also praised China for committing to the climate agreement. WRI is the second group Bishop and Westerman investigated for ties to China. Lawmakers asked the Natural Resource Defense Council NRDC for documents related to its Chinese ties in June. NRDC has a two decade relationship with Chinas communist government which it has heaped praise on for its commitment to fighting pollution and global warming. At the same time NRDC has relentlessly attacked the Trump administration Bishop and Westerman said in their letter to the group. Bishop and Westerman said NRDC and WRI activities mirror those laid out in reports on Chinas vast influence machine which it uses to shape its global image including on environmental issues. WRI has operated in China since 2008 and was issued a registration certificate in 2017 to work under the guidance and supervision of the Beijing Public Security Bureau and Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment the lawmakers wrote. WRI leadership regularly interacts with senior Chinese government and Communist party officials and provides public support for Chinese environmental programs Bishop and Westerman wrote.While WRI criticizes policies of the U.S. government WRI is silent on Chinese human rights violations such as arrests of environmental protesters and the mass detention of ethnic minorities. On important issues for Chinese leadership WRIs position appears to closely reflect Chinas goals and objectives the two lawmakers added. WRI did not immediately respond to The Daily Caller News Foundations request for comment.	False	False	False	True	False
Antarctica Has Lost More Than 3 Trillion Tons Of Ice In 25 Years Scientists have completed the most exhaustive assessment of changes in Antarctica's ice sheet to date. And they found that it's melting faster than they thought. Ice losses totaling 3 trillion tonnes or more than 3.3 trillion tons since 1992 have caused global sea levels to rise by 7.6 mm nearly one third of an inch according to a study published in Nature on Wednesday. Before 2010 Antarctica was contributing a relatively small proportion of the melting that is causing global sea levels to rise says study co leader Andrew Shepherd of the University of Leeds. But that has changed. Since around 2010 2012 we can see that there's been a sharp increase in the rate of ice loss from Antarctica. And the ice sheet is now losing three times as much ice Shepherd adds. The annual sea level rise that's attributed to Antarctica has tripled from 0.2mm to 0.6mm he says. That's a big jump and it did catch us all by surprise Shepherd says. The melting is caused by rising ocean temperatures due to climate change. Shepherd says they've seen the most dramatic effects in West Antarctica where the ice sheet rests on the sea bed. When we look into the ocean we find that it's too warm and the ice sheet can't withstand the temperatures that are surrounding it in the sea he says. That's causing glaciers to flow more quickly into the sea. East Antarctica which is home to the South Pole has seen considerably less melting because most of its ice is above sea level. That's an important distinction because it means it's insulated from changes in the ocean's temperature. This assessment conducted by 84 scientists from 44 international organizations is known as the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter comparison Exercise IMBIE. There have been many other estimates of how much ice has melted in Antarctica. And many of those papers showed different results. Some of the estimates covered different proportions of the ice sheets some of them covered different time periods and all of them used different methods and so it became difficult for people who are not specialists to try to pick them apart says Shepherd. So that was the motivation for originally setting up the project. The scientists combined 24 different satellite surveys which Shepherd says provides a more complete picture of the overall ice sheet change than previous studies. We believe that we've captured all of the different satellite records that exist on the planet he says. To analyze the ice the researchers use three different kinds of measurements. Satellite altimeters measure the height of the ice sheets to see how much they are thinning or thickening over time. Another measurement records the speed of the glaciers and how they're moving into the ocean. Finally the scientists are recording gravity measurements for Antarctica. These tell us about changes in the earth's gravitational attraction over time and that can be related to the mass of the ice sheets overall Shepherd says and they are really powerful measurements because they can add up everything across Antarctica. So what accounts for the apparent three fold speed up in Antarctica's melting in the last five years? Shepherd says that actually their data shows a a progressive increase in ice loss throughout the whole 25 year time period. However a period of heavy snowfall between 2005 and 2010 masked some of the immediate effects of the ice loss accounting for the sudden steep increase in more recent years. This new data creates a much starker picture of the future than previous estimates. Shepherd says until 2010 the data had been tracking a lower scenario which estimated that Antarctica wouldn't make much of a contribution to sea level rise at all because of the effects of higher snowfall. However he says that now the data is tracking a higher scenario which could mean nearly 6 inches of additional sea level rise in the next century. That could be a big deal he says for anybody who lives works and governs a coastal region. Understanding the rate of Antarctica's melting is crucial for these communities. If all of the ice in Antarctica melted global sea levels would rise by more than 190 feet.	True	True	False	True	False
North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper signed an executive order Monday he says is meant to combat climate change and lessen the impact of future natural disasters like hurricanes. Coopers order requires state agencies to encourage people to buy more electric vehicles use more wind and solar energy and cut energy use at state owned buildings. Cooper also asked agencies to promote climate adaptation and green energy use including wind and solar. A strong clean energy economy combats climate change while creating good jobs and a healthy environment said Cooper. With historic storms lashing our state we must combat climate change make our state more resilient and lessen the impact of future natural disasters.

Cooper however says his executive order will make North Carolina more resilient and lessen the impact of future natural disasters by putting more electric vehicles on the road and cutting emissions. But even if Coopers plan achieves its goal of cutting state greenhouse gas emissions it would have virtually no impact on projected global warming based on climate model simulations. For example the Obama administrations pledge to cut U.S. emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 was only projected toavert 0.001 degrees Celsius of projected global warminga year. If thats the impact on future temperatures cutting emissions for the entire country would have North Carolinas emissions cuts would have an even less significant impact.	True	True	False	True	True
ABC News Videos EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the agency unveiled a plan to start considering regulations on cancer causing perfluorinated substances or PFAS. The agency released whatActing EPA AdministratorAndrew Wheelercalled the most comprehensive cross agency plan to address an emerging chemical of concern ever undertaken by EPA. The regulator said it would set a limit for the chemical under the Safe Drinking Water Act by the end of the year. Wheeler said the EPA had already begun the regulatory development process for listing PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances making it easier to marshal funds to clean up contaminations. He said the plan would include new research methods to monitor pollution. Reports last month said Wheeler widely condemned for his links to big industry would not regulate the chemicals known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl compounds sometimes called perfluorinated substances or PFAS at all. But critics say the EPA has gathered more than enough data over the past decade to propose an immediate drinking water standard called a maximum contaminant limit. EPA needs to release strict drinking water standards and not just do a plan or do more research said Judith Enck a former regional EPA administrator who began dealing with a PFAS crisis in upstate New York in 2014. There is enough data to take action. There is not enough urgency by Acting Administrator Wheeler and he is putting the health of millions of Americans at risk. The announcement came as the EPA published its proposal to gut the Waters of the U.S. rule which extended protections to streams and wetlands that feed the drinking water of 117 million Americans. Wheeler whose nomination to be the nations 15th EPA administrator awaits a Senate confirmation vote took heat for refusing to commit to regulating PFAS at a hearing last month. Politico reported in January that the EPA did not plan to limit the chemicals. Asked if it was possible the EPA may eventually fail to set a maximum containment limit or MCL Wheeler said the agency cant predetermine what the outcome will be but has every intention of setting an MCL. The health and environmental effects of PFAS remained virtually ignored by regulators for decades. In the late 1990sa crusading attorneysued E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. over a massive contamination in Parkersburg West Virginia that killed livestock and sickened and deformed many residents in the rural Appalachian community that surrounded the chemical companys plant. After a years long legal battle DuPont divested its Chemours division and the companies reached a670 million agreementto settle 3550 personal injury lawsuits in February 2017. Minnesota based chemical giant 3M is now facing mounting lawsuits of its own. Yet the chemicals remain unregulated at the federal level. In January 2009 the EPA issued its first advisory in response to contamination in Alabama stating that perfluorooctanoic acid or PFOA one of the chemicals in the family posed a health risk only in concentrations higher than 400 parts per trillion. For perfluorooctane sulfonate or PFOS a sister chemical commonly used in fire retardants the EPA pegged the limit at 200 parts per trillion. In 2016 the EPA issued a newhealth advisorylowering the risk threshold to 70 parts per trillion for both PFOA and PFOS. That set off a chain reaction exposing local contaminations across the country including several in New York State. Last May the EPA hosted anational leadership summiton PFAS but the agencys decision to bar reporters from attending sessions and one officials manhandling of an Associated Press reporter overshadowed the event. Later that month the White House and EPA moved to suppress an Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry report that found PFAS pose health risks at 70 parts per trillion. A safer limit would be closer to 11 parts per trillion the agency determined.	False	False	False	True	False
Most also say that water is the most important issue to them in that category. According to the poll which has a 3.4 margin of error 67 of Democrats 54 of independents and 33 of Republicans believe that Democrat Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom and Republican businessman John Coxs views on environmental issues will impact how they vote. So far Newsom holds a 24 point lead over Cox who beat former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigos in the June primary to proceed to the November general election. Meanwhile the PPIC poll also found that likely voters see drought and water supply as the top environmental issue facing the state followed by air pollution a majority 58 support a water bond on the November ballot and noted that astrong majority of likely voters 69 say that the effects of global warming have already begun. In an interview with the Flash Report this week Cox said water housing affordability and the gas tax are the three main issues he wants to tackle. He reportedly blamed out of touch elites for the Golden States water issues and called Newsom the poster boy for these problems. Environmental issues have been a strong point for Newsom who last year said hewould use specific environmental laws in California to stop President Donald Trumps border wall from being built. For all the talk about the importance of environmental issues to voters in the deep blue state of California the topic does not seem to do well for media outlets even left wing ones. Chris Hayes of MSNBC recentlysaid networks mostly try to avoid discussing environmental issues related to the topic of climate change because almost without exception. every single time weve covered its been a palpable ratings killer. so the incentives are not great.

Climate change can't be halted if we carry on degrading the soil a report will say. There's three times more carbon in the soil than in the atmosphere but that carbon's being released by deforestation and poor farming. This is fuelling climate change and compromising our attempts to feed a growing world population the authors will say. Problems include soils being eroded compacted by machinery built over or harmed by over watering. Hurting the soil affects the climate in two ways it compromises the growth of plants taking in carbon from the atmosphere and it releases soil carbon previously stored by worms taking leaf matter underground. The warning will come from the awkwardly named IPBES the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services a panel studying the benefits of nature to humans. The body which is meeting this week aims to get all the worlds governments singing from the same sheet about the need to protect natural systems. IPBES will formally release its report on Monday 6 May. About 3.2 billion people worldwide are suffering from degraded soils said IPBES chairman Prof Sir Bob Watson. That's almost half of the world population. Theres no question we are degrading soils all over the world. We are losing from the soil the organic carbon and this undermines agricultural productivity and contributes to climate change. We absolutely have to restore the degraded soil weve got. Governments have focused on climate change far more than they have focused on loss of biodiversity or land degradation. All three are equally important to human wellbeing. Soil expert Prof Jane Rickson from Cranfield University UK added The thin layer of soil covering the Earth's surface represents the difference between survival and extinction for most terrestrial life. Only 3 of the planet's surface is suitable for arable production and 75 billion tonnes of fertile soil is lost to land degradation every year. She said soils form at a rate of 1cm in 300 years. There's uncertainty about the exact level of global soil degradation. But the major hotspots are reported to be in South America where forests are being felled sub Saharan Africa India and China. Soil scientists in both the biggest Asian nations are worried that their ability to grow their own food may be compromised. In the US some soils are being restored as forests take over poor quality land previously worked by small farmers but others are still being degraded. The UK is not immune either. Some maize fields in south west England suffer major soil loss with heavy rainfall because growing maize leaves bare soil exposed. Heavy rain is more likely under climate change. Erosion is also a long standing issue in the fertile Fens where on dry windy days peaty soil particles sometimes form a kind of smog called the Fen Blow. Peat has a high carbon content and a recent paper suggests theres far more carbon being lost from peatlands than previously thought. And on the chalky hills of southern England chemical intensive crop farming is said to have caused the loss of over a foot of soil in some places. Soils are incredibly important for our well being said Dr Joanna Clark from Reading University. We all know that crops are grown in soil but soils are important for climate change as well. There's three times more carbon stored in soil than there is in the atmosphere. So imagine if all that carbon was released wed get runaway climate change. So we need to keep the carbon in the soil. The simplest way to protect soils while combating climate change is to let forests grow back. This option is favoured by fans of re wilding. But some farmers believe they can continue to produce food by changing the way they farm to enhance the soil. Brexit could give the UK greater flexibility on how to spend public money on farming enabling much more leeway to reward farmers for capturing carbon in the earth. But there are more than 700 soil types in the UK alone so it wont be simple.	True	False	False	True	True
Last year was the Earth's warmest recorded year the third year in a row to set a new record for global average temperatures. Rising temperatures are likely to increase the intensity and impact of major storms scientists say yet in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma the Trump administration has resisted talking about climate change at all. Several key administration officials have been on message this week declining to discuss the issue and how to address the causes of global warming and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Mick Mulvaney the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget said climate change is a longer discussion on another day and a big topic for the media. I'll be more than happy to have a longer discussion on another day about climate change man made climate change Mulvaney told CNN's Jake Tapper on The Lead Wednesday. What we are focusing on right now is taking care of the folks who survived this disaster who need our immediate help he said. There's plenty of time later on to have those discussions and I know we will because climate change is clearly a big topic for the media but we will continue to focus our attention on the folks who need it right now. Both FEMA administrator Brock Long and acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke avoided explicitly answering in CNN interviews Tuesday whether the government needs to be more focused on climate change because of hurricanes such as Harvey and Irma. Both instead said the focus needs to be on preparedness and resiliency. Regardless of what causes disasters it's our job within the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA to manage the consequences Long told CNN. The only way we become resilient as a nation is we have to create that true culture of preparedness among our citizenry which we do not have and then we also have to look how we move forward when it comes to infrastructure protection. Duke echoed Long's thoughts on the need for resiliency a term frequently used during the administration's storm response. We live in a changing world and as the FEMA administrator said we always have to look at not just the response but the preparedness and the resilience said Duke. And I think it's important that as we come together as a country we look at the changes in our world and make sure that in planning and response that we are adapting properly. Pushed about whether the administration should also be looking at the cause of the storm Duke responded I you know the data I don't know what it particularly indicates. We haven't had a major storm like this in a quite a while. Duke added that she had to talk to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration about whether the storms were an anomaly year or a trend year. Global warming will likely cause tropical cyclones to intensify on average globally and add to a larger potential for destruction according to NOAA Tom Bossert White House adviser on Homeland Security was equally remiss to talk about the likely causes of the two hurricanes at a White House briefing Monday. Causality is something outside of my ability to analyze right now he said. There's a cyclical nature to a lot of these hurricanes. We continue to take seriously the climate change not the cause of it but the things we observe. He added that the White House would have to perform a trend analysis in the future insinuating that hurricane systems are cyclical and not tied to global warming. President Donald Trump who pulled the US out of the Paris climate accords earlier this year has previously called global warming a hoax. When asked whether Trump's personal opinion on climate change has changed at all White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said I don't think that it's changed over the last several weeks adding that she remains unsure whether the President is reconsidering the Paris deal following the hurricanes. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt told CNN in an interview about Hurricane Irma on Thursday that the time to talk about climate change isn't now saying the question was insensitive. Here's the issue Pruitt said. To have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm versus helping people or actually facing the effect of the storm is misplaced. In addition to the administration's efforts to wipe mention of climate change from the federal agency websites it has proposed cutting EPA funding intended to assist coastal communities in preparing for the impacts of climate change as well as rolled back regulations meant to advise on building against rising sea levels.

The White House on Tuesday denied that it is currently considering two controversial provisions to raise revenue as part of its broad tax overhaul. Earlier in the day The Washington Post reported that the Trump administration was looking at a value added tax or carbon tax as part of its reform plan. However the newspaper stressed administration officials say the plan is not finalized and the Trump administration continues to mull alternatives. As we have said many times the President's team is hearing input from experts on all sides of the tax reform debate as we formulate what will ultimately be the President's plan to enact the first significant tax reform since 1986. As of now neither a carbon tax nor a VAT are under consideration a White House spokeswoman said in a statement. Republicans have turned their attention to an overhaul of the U.S. tax system a key campaign goal after their first attempt to replace the Affordable Care Act failed. Opposition to border adjustment a House GOP provision designed to raise revenue and help to offset major tax cuts threatens to delay or trip up efforts to pass reform. A value added tax which is widely used around the world is consumption based. A carbon tax would hit emissions of greenhouse gases related to the burning of fossil fuels. The carbon tax would appear to clash with the priorities Trump has sought so far in his administration. He has taken steps to start rolling back environmental regulations on coal companies. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request to comment. Watch White House says no to VAT carbon tax	True	False	False	True	True
The Duke of Sussex has defended his use of private jets saying he occasionally needs to ensure his family is safe. Speaking at the launch of an eco tourism project in Amsterdam Prince Harry added that he balances out the impact this has on the environment. The duke and his wife Meghan have faced criticism after newspapers claimed they flew privately four times in 11 days this summer. Prince Harry said he flew to the event on Tuesday commercially. At the launch of Travalyst aimed at encouraging the tourism industry to become more sustainable the duke was asked about his travel behaviour. I came here by commercial. I spend 99 of my life travelling the world by commercial he said. Occasionally there needs to be an opportunity based on a unique circumstance to ensure that my family are safe it's generally as simple as that. During his opening speech the duke said no one is perfect in terms of his impact on the environment. Questions have been asked about the royal couple's use of private jets and their impact following their support of environmental causes. Prince Harry has previously spoken about the importance of tackling climate change. In September's edition of Vogue edited by Meghan the prince spoke about environmental issues and his love for nature saying We are the one species on this planet that seems to think that this place belongs to us and only us. The Sussexes came under fire over the summer after taking a private flight to the home of singer Sir Elton John in Nice. Sir Elton defended the royal couple saying he provided them with his private plane to maintain a high level of much needed protection. He also said he paid to carbon offset their trip to his French home. Carbon offsetting allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flights. The money is then invested in environmental projects such as planting trees or installing solar panels which reduce carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. The duke said that what is important is what we do to balance out negative effects. He went on to say that he has always offset his carbon emissions and will continue to do so. In my mind it's the right thing to do and we need to make it cool he said. We have to connect people to where that little bit of extra money is actually going. Prince Harry has spent three years working on the project alongside five co founders Booking.com Ctrip Skyscanner TripAdvisor and Visa. He hopes it will improve conservation environmental protection and help increase the economic benefits of tourism for local communities. Figures from accounts published in June show the royal household's carbon emissions due to business travel almost doubled last year. The increase was put down to the use of chartered flights for more overseas visits which are planned by the Foreign Office. However emissions savings from greener heating and lighting meant the household's overall carbon footprint stayed around the same as the previous year.	True	False	False	True	False
The move fulfills part of President Donald Trump's promise to help the coal industry but will likely face court challenges from environmental groups and several states who see the rollback as detrimental to clean air and efforts to fight the climate crisis. Former President Barack Obama's plan if implemented would have prevented 3600 premature deaths a year 1700 heart attacks and 90000 asthma attacks according to analysis conducted by the EPA under his tenure. The Obama Clean Power Plan was set to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to the climate crisis by up to 32 compared to 2005 levels by the same year. We are gathered here today because the American public elected a president with a better approach EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said Wednesday. In an initial announcement about the proposal last summer the Trump EPA labeled Obama's plan as overly prescriptive and burdensome. Instead the administration says the plan rule instead empowers states promotes energy independence and facilitates economic growth and job creation the release stated. RELATED More coal fired power plants have closed under Trump than in Obama's first term Democrats are betting big on big plans for 2020 Obama's Clean Power Plan was challenged by several lawsuits from industry groups and conservative led states. In 2016 the Supreme Court blocked the regulation but some plants had already started to work on reducing pollution. The new plan which EPA is calling the Affordable Clean Energy rule is designed to boost the struggling coal industry but also likely increase carbon emissions nationwide. EPA argues that any comparison to the Obama rule is incongruous because it was never implemented. The Affordable Clean Energy rule ACE gives states the regulatory certainty they need to continue to reduce emissions and provide affordable and reliable energy for all Americans Wheeler said. Unlike the CPP the ACE rule adheres to the four corners of the Clean Air Act. EPA sets the best system of emission reductions and then states set the standards of performance. But it's unclear how much the industry can benefit as it faces competition from cheap natural gas and renewable sources. US coal consumption has plunged 39 to the lowest level in 40 years according to the US Energy Information Administration. RELATED America's renewable energy capacity is now greater than coal New York Attorney General Letitia James said her state and others will go to court. Given its clear violation of the Clean Air Act I intend to sue the EPA over this Dirty Power rule and look forward to collaborating with other states and cities in taking action to protect all Americans from the increasingly disastrous impacts of climate change James said in a statement. Connecticut is in close coordination with states across the nation and we are prepared to take legal action to block this measure the state's attorney general William Tong. There is no serious debate climate change is a severe threat and we ignore science at our own peril. At a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing last week about the direction of the EPA former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy who finalized the Clean Power Plan under Obama said she believes the proposed Affordable Clean Energy rule as well as other proposed rules the agency has made since Trump took office undermines the science and the law in how they're trying to roll back those rules. I do not dispute any administration coming in with different policies but the challenge I think we're facing is they are really changing the rules of the road and not using sound science McCarthy said. They are not looking at cost benefits. They are trying to inflate the cost and lower the benefits in order to justify rules that simply don't make sense under the law.

Instead the city will look for energy from renewable sources including wind and solar he decided. This is the Green New Deal Not in concept not in the future but now Garcetti said as quoted by theLos Angeles Times. He made the decision despite the fact that top staffers have argued in recent months that the gas plants are critical to keeping the lights on in the city theTimes noted. The term Green New Deal refers to a bill introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D NY last week which proposes moving the entire U.S. economy to renewable energy in the next ten years. The plan also aims to provide every American with a guaranteed job with a family sustaining wage adequate family and medical leave paid vacations and retirement security to all people. The bill does not explain how those benefits will be paid for nor how the renewable energy goals will be achieved given that renewables currently provide less than 20 of the countrys energy. Environmentalists are also opposed to using one of those renewable sources hydroelectric power because of concerns about environmental damage caused by dams. California has a law already in place mandating a shift to 100 renewable sources but by 2045 not 2030. It is not clear how the state will achieve that goal. In his comments Garcetti slammed natural gas as an energy source Now is the time to start the beginning of the end of natural gas. Ironically the switch from coal to natural gas over the past decade has enabled the U.S. economy to grow while reducing emissionsover the long run. More gas for electricity has been our most effective weapon at combating climate change wrote RealClearEnergy editor Jude Clemente last year. Garcetti pledged to replace L.A.s natural gas plants with wind and solar energy but offered no plans describing how the city would do so nor whether it would be able to meet the energy needs of an expanding city. Southern California already struggles to provide electricity to consumers during heat waves when air conditioning use is at a maximum and prices soar. In addition utilities have begun shutting down power lines during high winds for fear of starting wildfires. During a natural gas leak in Porter Ranch in 2016 L.A. authorities worried that the temporary closure of one natural gas plant could lead to power outages. Nevertheless Eric Garcetti was bullish on a future without fossil fuels even without a plan to replace them. The mayor said he had challenged the citys Department of Water and Power to come up with an answer Instead of saying all the reasons why not get to a reason as to why. Garcetti will leave office in 2022. The first of the three plants to be replaced will be retired in 2024. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor at Large at Breitbart News.

Alexandria Ocasio Cortez isn't old enough to run for president. But the freshman congresswoman from New York introduced a Green New Deal resolution on Thursday that is already emerging as a key policy test for 2020 Democratic candidates. Our first step is to define the problem and define the scope of the solution Ocasio Cortez told reporters during a Thursday afternoon press conference for her newly introduced proposal which was quickly backed by Democratic presidential hopefuls Senators Kirsten Gillibrand Kamala Harris Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker. Small incremental policy solutions are not enough. Several contenders vying for the Democatic nomination have expressed support for the underlying principles of the sweeping resolution to combat climate change and activist groups energized by the November midterm election wins have been pressuring candidates to sign on as co sponsors. We are going to be pressuring all the 2020 contenders especially the senators to co sponsor the bill Stephen O'Hanlon a spokesperson for the Sunrise Movement a climate change group that staged a high profile sit in in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office in November which Ocasio Cortez attended told CBS News. It will make clear who is just using it as a buzzword and who is taking it seriously. Progressive activists are extremely supportive of the Green New Deal and think of it as the gold standard plan on climate and expect their presidential candidates to be treating it as such said Chad Bolt associate policy director of Indivisible a grassroots resistance group. Bolt says the environment ranks among the top three issues for its members. The resolution introduced by Ocasio Cortez and Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey a Democrat is broad and light on specifics and seen more as a roadmap for overhauling the economy than a concrete piece of legislation. The resolution includes plans to decarbonize the economy reduce greenhouse gases make sure low income and minority communities benefit create a federal jobs guarantee provide universal health care and make investments in infrastructure. The Green New Deal proposal is named after President Franklin Roosevelt's sweeping New Deal economic and labor reforms during the Great Depression. It's aimed a transforming the American economy by ending its dependence on fossil fuels investing heavily in renewable energy like solar and wind and sparking large scale job creation. Some proposals have set the goal to converting the entire U.S. economy to renewable energy within 12 years and eliminating the carbon footprint by 2030. The lack of specifics could present opportunities and liabilities for presidential candidates. On one hand it becomes a kind of catch all way to talk about the environment jobs and economic fairness issues at the forefront of the party's primary. But on the other it could put candidates in a difficult position when pressed on the costs and impact on certain jobs and industries. The debate over Medicare for All has already shown the kinds of risks and rewards candidates face. Republicans have branded the proposal as a costly fringe policy goal and many centrist Democrats have not backed the initiative. Pelosi referred to it Thursday morning as a suggestion and the green dream. It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive Pelosi told Politico in an interview. The green dream or whatever they call it nobody knows what it is but they're for it right? Later in the morning Pelosi said she had not seen the proposal. I do know its enthusiastic and I welcome all the enthusiasm that is out there she told reporters during her weekly press conference. Pelosi also named the nine Democratic members of the new Select Committee on the Climate Crisis and notably left Ocasio Cortez off the list. The New York Democrat said Pelosi offered her a spot but she declined it because she wanted to focus on the legislative side of climate policy. Despite some hesitation within the party the Democratic base sees the proposal as a way for its leaders to capitalize on their new power in Washington. In a statement to CBS News on Tuesday Congressman Ral Grijalva Democrat of Arizona confirmed that he will be supporting the resolution after initially being reluctant to back it. The Green New Deal will put the health and well being of our communities first Grijalva said. Its aspirational goals will help our country combat climate change through clean and renewable energy create millions of new jobs in the process and safeguard our environment for generations to come. Most of the Democratic presidential candidates have also broadly endorsed the idea behind the Green New Deal. Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley who's mulling a presidential bid said the issue should be an integral part of his party's agenda going forward. On CBSN's Red and Blue Merkley outlined what he believes should be the key components of a comprehensive Green New Deal. The core objectives are some things such as let's drive a fast transition from fossil fuel carbon transmission creating energy sources to renewable energy so that we save our planet. Second principle is let's create tens of millions of jobs as we renovate our energy economy he said Tuesday. A third principle a just transition for fossil fuel workers so that no one is left behind and so we show respect and gratitude for all the work they've done to power economy is the decades past.

Reuters Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D N.Y. waves at an enthusiastic crowd of hometown supporters half of whom raised their hands when MSNBC host Chris Hayes a fellow Bronx native asked who was from the borough. On Tuesday four members of the Senates Democratic caucus joined every Republican in voting to block a resolution staking out what should be in future Green New Deal legislation. On Wednesday conservatives leading voice of reason on climate change published a widely shared essay that offered talking points to oppose the Green New Deal without invoking hamburger bans Stalinism or genocide. On Thursday night President Donald Trump smeared the Green New Deal as an extreme 100 trillion government takeover at a rally in Michigan leading the crowd in chants of AOC sucks. As her allies are readying primary challenges against Democrats who refuse to join the Green New Deals 100 co sponsors in Congress Ocasio Cortez said You dont necessarily have to replace everybody. Instead shes betting the increasingly visible and deadly effects of climate change will unite a popular base so vast the market fundamentalists in both parties who oppose the kind of New Deal era big government policies needed to match the scope of the climate crisis will fall in line. For years positions in the debate over mainstream climate policies ranged from hard line denial of climate change on one end to moderate market tweaks on the other. Democrats regularly introduced bills to put a price on carbon dioxide emissions through a cap and trade scheme or a carbon tax. Tax incentives for renewable energy sources like solar and wind enjoyed bipartisan support yet so too did subsidies for oil and gas production. Then in October United Nations scientists forecast average temperatures to increase at least 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit a catastrophic spike likely to cost 54 trillion in damage and countless lives unless world governments took unprecedented measures to halve global emissions over the next decade. A month later a congressionally mandated report by 13 federal agencies confirmed the research. The findings made clear that market fixes alone might have worked in the 1970s when scientists first understood the climate impacts of burning fossil fuels but now its too late. That hasnt helped tamp down opposition from powerful building trades unions that rely on the pipeline and coal train industries for lucrative jobs. Countering the fossil fuel industrys appeal to organized labor is an uphill battle for Green New Deal advocates. Very few renewable energy jobs are unionized and the steady march of right to work laws in red states over the past decade makes it difficult to envision a future in which new industries enjoy the same labor precedents as older ones. Ocasio Cortez said that was one reason the Green New Deal movement could not abandon its class politics to secure support from avowedly pro business conservatives. We cannot allow for the fossil fuel jobs to be better more dignified and higher waged with stronger labor support behind them than new energy jobs she said. What Im tired of is us worrying more about the future of fossil fuels than worry about the future of fossil fuel workers. On Monday Sen. Lamar Alexander R Tenn. cribbed the Green New Deals rhetoric harkening to a World War II level mobilization effort when he proposed a New Manhattan Project for Clean Energy that he said would double federal funding for energy research and implement a five year plan to create new sources of cheap clean energy. That same week Rep. Matt Gaetz R Fla. a loyal Trump ally drafted a nonbinding resolution staking out a Green Real Deal that would acknowledge the threat climate change poses to human health and safety in communities across the United States. We have this idea that left ideas are moving and shaking inside the political atmosphere right now. Thats true. But theyre left in terms of Washington. But in terms of the American people theyre centrist ideas. Heather McGhee senior fellow at the progressive think tank Demos A decade of disputation is followed now by this incredible uptick of Republicans looking around for solutions former Rep. Bob Inglis R S.C. whose support for climate action led to his ouster in a primary challenge in 2010 said at the event where he was the lone Republican. Weve now seen the whites of its eyes.

NEW YORK Over the past two yearscorporate giants have become some of the loudest voices calling for climate change action. Automakers that once killed the electric car are racing to roll outzero emissions rivals to Tesla. Even Exxon Mobil Corp. the oil behemoth that spent decades bankrolling a Big Tobacco style campaign to discredit global warming has named a climate scientist to its board. The site fits comfortably into Bloombergs stable of products anchored by its lucrative data terminal business. In December 2015 just before 195 countries reached the historic emissions cutting deal known as the Paris Agreement Bloomberg published its Carbon Clock featuring a carbon dioxide tracker overlaid on satellite images of the Earth. The company owns Bloomberg New Energy Finance a data firm dedicated to the energy industry. Michael Bloomberg who returned to his namesake company after his third term as New York City mayor is an outspoken climate advocate who this week published a book with former Sierra Club chief Carl Pope on how cities and businesses can lead energy reform. For the launch the site will include a feature on how communities in South Florida are coping with rising waters a short animated video series on heat extreme weather and the cost of carbon and a multi part graphic on Russias growing influence in the fast warming Arctic. Climate Changed gives Bloomberg a leg up on The Wall Street Journal arguably its chief competitor in the market for prestige journalism. The Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers hard line conservativismappears to have bled over from the opinion pages to the news section. A study published in 2015 by researchers at Rutgers University the University of Michigan and the University of Oslo found that from 2006 to 2011 the Journals news reporting rarely mentionedthreats or effects of climate change compared with the countrys other leading broadsheet newspapers. But the new Bloomberg site isnt looking to make a political splash necessarily.Sure President Donald Trump has dismissed climate change as a Chinese hoax and has made gutting environmental policies a cornerstone of his agenda since entering the White House. And yes his budget director called efforts to mitigate or halt climate change a waste of your money. But at Bloomberg raw hard data trumps political rhetoric and the editors there dont buy the billionaire presidents bombast. There is a difference between Trump the politician and Trump the investor Jared Sandberg senior executive editor in Bloombergs digital division told HuffPost. Trump is already building a wall around his seaside Irish golf resort Sandberg noted a sign the risk of rising sea levels is too high to ignore. Its the mother of all risk Sandberg added. If you have intelligence agencies around the world identifying climate change as one of the great destabilizing forces theres a massive risk to contend with for any business and any investor behind it. Climate Changed wont be focused on debunking fringe voices the sort that might show on the pages of the far right news site Breitbart who seek to undermine climate science by depicting it as some kind of conspiracy. Comparing what people say to data then stepping out of the room is sort of the best thing journalists can do Roston said. We dont have a social mission other than transparency and fact checking. Throughout the economy fossil fuels being only the most obvious example new information has come to light that challenges whether historic price levels of these things are appropriate given what weve learned about their impact on society Roston said. He admitted in a media environment that rewards sensationalism and factual manipulation the approach may seem a bit bland. Were not going to win the internet by going out and saying everybody is doing it wrong its just a pricing story. But from a Bloomberg perspective its helpful for me to think of in terms of repricing events. The site has yet to lock down advertisers to sponsor the launch. But it shouldnt have much trouble finding bidders. Nearly every company in the SP 500 now issues regular reports on sustainability efforts. The business community absolutely demands this the investor community demands this Sandberg said. You dont go through the quarterly quarterly results from Coke Levis or anyone else and not come away thinking that they dont have concerns over limited resources like water. The question isnt why now its why havent we all agreed to do this sooner Sandberg added. Weve always had this kind of coverage but I think its high time we do something better to admire it organize it and make it easier for people to discover.	True	True	False	True	True
Watch CNN's live town hall on the climate crisis featuring 10 Democratic presidential candidates tonight beginning at 5 p.m. ET. CNN Candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination and most scientists say the climate crisis is the existential threat of our time while President Donald Trump once claimed it's a hoax cooked up by the Chinese. Trump also said at last month's G7 meeting that I'm an environmentalist citing his experience filing environmental impact statements as a businessperson though he skipped an actual session about climate change that his fellow world leaders attended. That pretty much sums up the difference between how a Democrat would treat climate change compared with Trump as an emergency as opposed to as a joke. That in itself would be an enormous switch. This is a worldwide issue and solving it will take cooperation from countries like China and India. In addition the most important actions the US could take would require congressional approval no easy task when the Senate floor is controlled by a Republican who represents coal country. But presidents actually have quite a bit of power to change US climate policy on their own without waiting for Congress. A first set of steps would be to roll back numerous Trump actions that either sidelined US leadership on the climate or rescinded new standards that had been implemented during the Obama administration. CNN gathered input from advocacy groups former government officials and academics. Here are some things any president could do on Day One in office climate agreement was Promising to withdraw the US from the landmark 2015climate agreement was Trump's benchmark action rebutting the responsibility to act on climate change . He said without much evidence that it was a demeaning failure for American workers who would be expected to do more than those in other countries. The result is the US is one of just a few countries not taking part in the effort in which nations committed to varying amounts of carbon reduction. Every candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination has said they would bring the US back in. The US was supposed to reduce carbon emissions by 26 from 2005 levels by 2025 under the agreement. It probably won't get there with the willful sabotage of the Trump administration. But with certain states cities and companies trying to fill the void the US could get most of the way there according to groups like America's Pledge the coalition pushed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former California Gov. Jerry Brown. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont was the first presidential candidate to argue that Trump instead of declaring a national emergency at the border should do it on the climate instead. Others like Tom Steyer have followed suit. This would certainly focus national attention and could free up some funds without congressional approval. The President could easily declare a goal of 100 decarbonization by a given year say 2050 and direct his or her Cabinet secretaries to do everything in their power to meet it. At the request of automakers the Trump administration worked to roll back fuel economy standards for cars and trucks. A different President could push things again in the other direction. 5. Set a zero emission deadline for the US The Clean Power Plan was an Obama era regulatory scheme that required states to meet specific carbon emission reduction standards based on their individual energy consumption. The plan includes an incentive program for states to get a head start on meeting standards on early deployment of renewable energy and low income energy efficiency. 8. Reverse Trump's plan to speed up oil and gas pipelines Workers in the Bureau of Land Management worked through the partial government shutdown early this year to approve more and more applications for oil and natural gas drilling on public lands. A new administration could move in the opposite direction. 13. Use the SEC to scrutinize banks and investors for climate risks Most attention for climate change goes to the energy sector but banks and investors have an important role too. The Securities and Exchange Commission asks companies what risks climate change and new climate change regulations pose to their investments. 14. Tap into growing public sentiment and work with corporations States and cities are addressing climate change be it with zero emission vehicle goals or the regional cooperative of states in the Northeast that is trying to cap and reduce carbon emissions on its own. Corporate America is also moving on its own. It's setting up coalitions of companies and lobbying Congress for new action on climate change. As it stands right now the federal government is not even a part of that conversation. Pretty much everyone who agrees that climate change is a problem agrees that Congress will ultimately have to address it in a big way. That means placing some kind of price on carbon. The House voted to do this in 2010 but the so called cap and trade proposal didn't get a vote in the Senate and then Democrats lost control of the House for eight years.	True	False	False	True	True
The Amazon rainforest is on fire and the consensus is that Brazils far right populist leader Jair Bolsonaro is to blame. Bolsonaro who took office in January and has been referred to as Captain Chainsaw gutted funding for agencies protecting the massive rainforest essentially giving wink and nudge approval for illegal loggers to do their thing. Fire is used as a tool for clearing Amazon land for ranching and the more trees are cut down the more vulnerable the rainforest is to wildfires. There have been almost twice as many fires detected in 2019 so far as there were in the entirety of 2018. Its hard to overstate how threatening this policy is to the climate. The Amazon is the worlds largest rainforest its trees scrub the Earth of a significant amount of CO2 and have captured a huge amount of carbon and methane within their branches and roots. If you lose the trees a lot of greenhouse gases get released and it becomes harder to capture emissions from other sources. Continued fires and clear cutting in the Amazon could cripple the fight against climate change. All of this goes to underscore an important and poorly understood point The wave of right wing populism sweeping the world is not only dangerous for the countries who succumb to it or even to immigrants wishing to move to those nations. Its a fundamental threat to progress against climate change and thus the entirety of the human race. Bolsonaro has been dubbed the Trump of the Tropics a far right firebrand who shares the American presidents hostility to democracy and penchant for saying extremely offensive things about women and minorities. The similarities clearly extend to climate policy Trump famously labeled climate change a Chinese hoax pulled out of the Paris agreement on climate change and recently presented a carbon regulation plan that could actually increase emissions. The American and Brazilian leaders are particularly aggressive on the issue but theyre hardly alone among Western right wingers. A February report from the German Adelphi Institute an environmental think tank found that 18 out of the 21 largest European far right parties are either generally indifferent to climate action or outright oppose it. Nigel Farage the leader of Britains Brexit party recently called climate change a scam during an interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Germanys Alternatives for Deutschland AfD claims in its most recent electoral platform that CO2 is not a pollutant but an indispensable component of all life. By contrast the centrist and left parties in these countries were prior to the populist wave of the past few years doing a markedly better job on addressing climate change not perfect or sufficient mind you but comparatively much better than what the far right parties want. Between 2003 2011 a left wing Brazilian government managed to cut Amazon deforestation rates by 80 percent. Obama massively boosted the American renewables industry via the 2009 stimulus helped negotiate the Paris Climate Accord and implemented the Clean Power Plan to cut emissions from US power plants. In 2005 the EU put in place the worlds first major emissions permit and trading system the European Union Emissions Trading System or EU ETS. So theres a clear contrast between the right wing populists on the one hand and their leading opponents on the other. Right wing populism today centers on a particular kind of chauvinistic nationalism an America First style obsession with the importance of their typically ethnically defined home nation and its independence from international institutions. European populists hate the European Union with its open borders approach to immigration and transnational economic regulations both Trump and Bolsonaro have insulted international institutions and withdrawn from global agreements. This brand of populism poses a particular challenge for the effort against climate change. Its a global issue that no one country can solve on its own it requires collective action negotiated through some forum like the Paris Climate Agreement. Its a paradigmatic example of the limits of nationalism and the need for organizations like the UN and EU. You cant propose an effective solution to a transnational problem through a narrowly nationalist framework and yet the nationalists are here attacking both climate policies in their own country and the very idea of global governance itself. This is a crucial time a recent UN report claims we have 11 years to prevent irreversible damage from climate change. Large population centers like the United States Brazil and the EU as a bloc are responsible for a major chunk of emissions. Its especially important that wealthy countries take the lead on the issue. Poorer countries are less likely to act when they think theyre unfairly bearing the burden of a problem kickstarted by Western industrial development. Backsliding in the US and Europe hurts climate action everywhere. Right wing populists are often framed as a threat to Western democracy and they certainly are that. But the stakes are even bigger than they appear at first glance Its not just the survival of Western democracy thats at stake but the planet itself.	True	False	False	True	True
Rose Strauss apparently isnt showing favoritism in the race for Pennsylvania governor at least when it comes to asking candidates about climate change. The 18 year old activist made a name for herself beyond the Keystone State last month when she questioned Republican gubernatorial nominee Scott Wagner at a town hall on what she said was his lack of action on climate change and donations he received from the fossil fuel industry. And why did Strauss win the internet that day? Well in a way she has Wagner to thank for that as he responded by calling Strauss a little young and naive on video which subsequently went viral. Wagner also asked the Glenside crowd Are we here to elect a governor or are we here to elect a scientist? Wagner in 2017 said climate change is likely occurring but perhaps because we have more people. You know humans have warm bodies. So is heat coming off? And his campaign has received163750 from the oil and gas industry according to Vote Smart a nonprofit political watch dog organization the York Dispatch said. John Fetterman the running mate for Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf ripped Wagner on Twitter over his comments toward Strauss. He also used a Young and Naive slogan for 25 T shirts the York Daily Record reported while Wolfs campaign announced free limited edition stickers using the phrase It turns out all the T shirts and stickers in the world immortalizing Wagners words to her could not impede Strauss from turning her confrontation Wolfs way as she and activists tried to intercept the governor as he walked into an event last week the Daily Record said. Tom Wolf! Its Rose Strauss! Its Rose Strauss Tom Wolf! shes heard shouting on video. Im the girl whos young and naive! Strauss then yelled a question at Wolf about the funds his campaign got from the fossil fuel industry 98000 during the 2018 election cycle according to Follow the Money. Strauss said Sunrise Movement Downingtown has twice reached out to Joseph Hill Wolfs deputy campaign manager and political director to request a meeting but has yet to receive a response the Daily Record reported. He has shown support for the young and naive voters Strauss told the paper adding that while Wolf has supported us verbally the governor hasnt committed to action on things we care about like climate change. Wolfs campaign declined to say if hell meet with Strauss and other activists but offered the following statement to the Daily Record Governor Wolf is committed to protecting and preserving the environment. One of his first acts as governor was to sign an executive order reinstating the moratorium on new leases for drilling in state parks and forests and he has been fighting efforts by Republicans in Washington to cut EPA funding. Governor Wolf worked across party lines with the state legislature which is heavily Republican to pass the Chapter 78a Environmental Protection Performance Standards. This bipartisan agreement modernizes and strengthens environmental protections at oil and gas sites in Pennsylvania. He also announced a nation leading strategy to reduce emissions of methane. Governor Wolf has met with environmentalists throughout the state to discuss ways they could work together to combat climate change and strengthen statewide regulations to ensure the protection of public health safety and the environment. He will continue to engage the environmental community throughout the commonwealth to ensure that their voices are heard. Scott is having town halls to articulate his positions on the issues to people of all demographics and backgrounds Wagner campaign spokesman Andrew Romeo told TheBlaze on Wednesday. And while some might disagree with him on a policy approach to an issue which is what happened at the Montgomery County Town Hall he will continue to hold similar events for the remainder of the campaign. If voters want to know Scotts position on an issue they wont have to ambush him outside an event just to get a hold of him they can come ask him their questions in person. He certainly wont bury his head and keep walking. Wagner has since clarified his young and naive comment noting in a Sunday town hall that he didnt believe it was mean and that Im 62 years old and the young lady asking the question was 18. I have a little more experience than she does the Daily Record reported. And that wasnt meant to insult her in any way.	True	False	True	True	False
President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax and a very expensive tax on American businesses that make the US less competitive. He has threatened to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord in which countries around the world pledged to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to keep temperatures from rising past the critical 2C mark. And yet climate change is already imperiling Mar a Lago the crown jewel of Trumps extensive real estate portfolio and his preferred location for carrying out many of his official presidential duties. Rising sea levels are causing more frequent and more damaging tidal floods on the Florida coast and projections suggest that the risk to lives and property from climate change related flooding events is only going to increase dramatically in the coming years. The National and Oceanic Atmospheric Administration NOAA has put out a variety of different estimates of rising sea levels in Southern Florida. The more conservative finding suggests that they could jump anywhere from 3 feet by 2050 to 7 feet by 2100. But in January the agency put out new extreme sea level projections its doomsday scenario in other words. In this scenario wed see a 10 to 12 foot rise in sea level in the US by 2100 which would have dramatic consequences for places like Mar a Lago as you can see in the photo above. So what would a 10 foot rise in sea levels mean for Florida? Heres a satellite image of what that would look like. Large swaths of the state are submerged. Miami is entirely flooded along with the rest of Southern Florida There is evidence that average sea levels are already steadily rising in Southern Florida. A 2016 paper found that in the past decade the average rate of sea level rise had tripled from 3 millimeters a year to 9 millimeters. And overall sea levels in Southern Florida had risen about 90 millimeters or 3.5 inches since 2006. Of the 30 most populous US cities that would be negatively affected by extreme sea level rise Climate Central a nonprofit climate science research group found that 19 were located in Florida circled in yellow in the chart below. Scientists dont have a great understanding of how exactly rapidly sea levels will continue to rise or the precise impact on specific areas. But new research that indicates parts of the Antarctic ice sheet may collapse in the next 100 years and that has scientists scrambling to model more extreme scenarios. If the Antarctic ice sheet does melt it could trigger a catastrophic 10 foot spike in sea levels and inundate major US cities like New York and Miami displacing nearly 150 million people worldwide. It may be a lot less stable in Antarctica than we thought said Ben Strauss a vice president at Climate Central. But the truth is we are relatively early in our scientific understanding of how the great ice sheets will respond to warming. Last summer the Guardian investigated Trumps coastal properties to see how at risk each of them were to flooding from rising sea levels. What they found was Mar a Lago was already in serious trouble. The estate was at high risk for flooding during heavy rains and storms with water already pooling on the premises in addition to nearby bridges and roads in Palm Beach. Plus in the next 30 years they estimated there will be 210 days a year where Mar a Lago will be flooded with at least a foot of water. Keren Bolter chief scientist for Coastal Risk Consulting and the firm that analyzed Trumps properties told the Guardian that tidal flooding in the next 30 years could partially submerge some of the clubs luxurious cottages and bungalows. And perhaps even eventually render Trumps Southern White House uninhabitable.	True	False	False	True	False
Julin Castro the first 2020 Democratic presidential candidate at the CNN climate town hall set the tone early in the night by giving a shout out to Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington the self professed climate candidate whose six part plan has been adopted by several other candidates since he dropped out of the race last month. Calling climate change an existential threat a phrase that is sure to come up several more times tonight Mr. Castro said his first move as president would be to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord. The United States hasnt actually withdrawn from the global climate change agreement and legally cannot until November 2020 but President Trump has vowed to do so. Still Mr. Castro said its actually what comes next that is most important saying he would impose a fee on carbon pollution enact an executive order prohibiting fossil fuel exploration and development on public lands and spend 10 trillion over 10 years to reach net zero emissions by 2045. The former secretary for Housing and Urban Development and mayor of San Antonio drew on his experience working with families who had lost their homes to flooding and called for subsidizing the National Flood Insurance Program. An activist from the Sunrise Movement a liberal environmental group asked Mr. Castro why he should be trusted to move the country away from fossil fuels when he supported fracking. Shes right. When I was mayor of San Antonio I did believe that there were opportunities to be had with fracking that was going on in South Texas. But he said at the time natural gas was described as a bridge fuel to help wean the country off coal and toward cleaner fuels. Were coming to the end of the bridge Mr. Castro said. He said while he isnt calling for an immediate national ban on fracking he supports local communities that do so and called for moving to cleaner sources. Mr. Castro won some of his strongest applause when he leaned into his rsum as the nations housing chief and connected his work with the need to protect low income communities from environmental damages. He recounted discovering that 70 percent of subsidized housing was within a mile of a superfund site saying Thats the environmental injustice of racism that were dealing with.

As levels of greenhouse gases reach a new record concerns are growing about the role of China in global warming. For years the increase in the number of Chinese coal fired power stations has been criticised. Now environmental groups say China is also backing dozens of coal projects far beyond its borders. Coal is the most damaging of the fossil fuels because of the quantity of carbon dioxide it releases when it's burned. Last year the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached its highest level for the past 3 5 million years according to the latest research by the UN's weather agency the World Meteorological Organisation WMO. And last month the UN's climate science panel said that coal must be phased out by 2050 if the world is to have any chance of limiting the rise in temperatures. The Chinese supported coal projects are under way or planned as far afield as South America Africa southeast Asia and the Balkans. Contracts and financing for these facilities are often not fully transparent but campaign groups including Bankwatch have tried to keep track. You cannot be a world leader in curbing air pollution and at the same time the world's biggest financier of overseas coal power plants the group's energy coordinator Ioana Ciuta told the BBC. According to Ms Ciuta efforts to tackle the dirty air of Chinese cities have led many power companies to limit their ambitions for coal fired power stations in China itself and to target their technology and labour overseas instead. By having China invest in over 60 countries along the Belt and Road Initiative it's perpetuating a source of pollution that has been demonstrated to be harmful not just to the climate but also to economies she said. In Serbia one of the country's largest coal fired power stations is being expanded with the help of a loan from a Chinese bank and with the work being led by one of China's largest construction companies. An hour's drive east of the capital Belgrade in the coal rich Danube valley construction has already started at the site known as Kostolac B3. An existing power station towers over the rolling landscape a steady stream of pollution twisting from a massive smokestack and conveyor belts ferry coal from a nearby open cast mine at Drmno. The power station is run by the national Serbian electricity company EPS which provides about 70 of the country's power by burning coal the rest comes from hydro electric schemes. Now under a 715m 560m contract agreed by the Serbian government and Chinese President Xi Jinping an extra unit is being added which will bring 350MW of additional capacity with the latest super critical technology. When we visit we catch a brief glimpse of a group of Chinese workers wearing hard hats on their way from the construction site to a vast set of accommodation blocks by next year some 1500 Chinese staff will be here. Safety signs and notice boards are written in Serbian and Chinese. Equipment and shipping containers carry Chinese labels. I ask the EPS official running the project Zeljko Lazovic what he feels about such a large and important venture being in the hands of Chinese engineers and workers. In the next few months a lot of Chinese will come here and this will be a big challenge he says. With Chinese workers and Serbian workers at the beginning we had some cultural problems but we have overcome them and there is now very good cooperation. When asked about the environmental cost of the new project Mr Lazovic insisted it would meet all the EU's standards on pollution by dust nitrogen dioxide and sulphur. However the new unit will not be fitted with any carbon capture technology so it will fit into a pattern of Chinese backed projects that will add to carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Christine Shearer is an analyst with the group CoalSwarm which tracks coal developments and she is scathing about the implications. These projects are not compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C or 2C she said referring to the two targets of the Paris Agreement on climate change. She says that Chinese financial institutions are filling a gap left by Western banks and agencies deciding to limit their involvement in coal. These projects if completed will lock the countries into high carbon emitting infrastructure and volatile coal imports precisely at a time when prices for clean energy are starting to fall below that of coal power. We tried to contact the Export Import Bank of China which is providing the loan and the China Machinery Engineering Corporation which is leading the construction but did not hear back. For the Serbian power company EPS the attraction of a local supply of coal has combined with a cheap Chinese loan and the prospects of valuable exports of electricity. About 3500 jobs depend on the Kostolac complex but some local people have become increasingly outspoken about the pollution in the area. Momir Savic showed me how the conveyor belts carrying coal run close to the villages and he fears a further expansion of the operation. The quality of our air and water is very poor. We cannot grow fruit and vegetables. There is also a lot of noise. All this affects the health of people living here many of whom have respiratory diseases he said. EPS says it is spending hundreds of millions of euros on environmental protection but its track record clearly does not inspire trust. Pera Markovic a lawyer with Cekor an environmental group is critical of the company's failure to limit pollution in the local area. But he concedes that Serbia is heavily dependent on coal for its power. For how long? Decades Mr Markovic says. That's likely to be the same in many other countries too whatever climate scientists say is needed.	False	False	False	True	True
Thousands gathered in cities across the globe including London Berlin Tokyo and Washington DC to protest anthropogenic climate change and the purported lack of urgency to address it. However there was a remarkable lack of participation from individuals in China the planets worst greenhouse gas emitter minus a protest in Hong Kong. According to the Guardian No protests were authorized in China. However the China Youth Climate Action NetworksZheng Xiaowen said that Chinese youth have their own methods. We also pay attention to the climate and we are also thinking deeply interacting taking action and so many people are very conscientious on this issue she added. Several climate change activists in D.C. decried the U.S. for its role in contributing to climate change despite the fact that the U.S. has made great strides in reducing its carbon output seeing the largest decline in CO2 emissions in the world for 9th time this century in 2017. The largest increase that year came from China. According to a report released by theEnvironmental Protection Agency EPA last year the U.S. reduced its greenhouse gas output by 2.7 percent during President Trumps first year in office. Thanks to President Trumps regulatory reform agenda the economy is booming energy production is surging and we are reducing greenhouse gas emissions from major industrial sources EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said at the time. These achievements flow largely from technological breakthroughs in the private sector not the heavy hand of government. The Trump Administration has proven that federal regulations are not necessary to drive CO2 reductions Wheeler continued. While many around the world are talking about reducing greenhouse gases the U.S. continues to deliver and todays report is further evidence of our action oriented approach he added. Rep. Adam Kinzinger R IL reiterated that point to Greta Thunberg and the other climate kids who testified before theHouse Committee on Foreign Affairs andSelect Committee on the Climate Crisis on Wednesday. Meanwhile as the West looks at options to combat climate change we all know that Chinas global emissions continue to rise. For every ton of carbon dioxide reduced by the United States China adds nearly four times as much Kinzinger said. Today the Chinese account for 30 percent of global emissions. While some may say that the United States needs to be the leader of combating climate change I would say that we already are he continued. Since 2005 global emissions have increased by 20 percent but the United States emissions have decreased by more than the next 12 emission reducing countries combined he added. As Breitbart News reported China is ramping up its coal powered energy supply with the total of future projects now standing at 226.2 gigawatts GW Despite Chinas blatant disregard for the calls of climate change alarmists it has been granted permission to speak at the U.N. international climate summit next week in New York.

Yahoo News reported Saturday that temperatures in Great Britain could reach as low as 14C with snow event after snow event expected to hit various parts of the territory. Forecasters expect the lasting cold spell to begin sometime this month and to continue at least through March. October is now looking like it will turn out to be colder than average with more of a chance of something wintery setting in through the second half of the month according to Exacta Weather forecaster James Madden. There is a strong chance of widespread frosts and the chance of snowfall which will set the scene for November Madden said. This will pave the way for what is shaping up to be a colder than average winter with some extreme cold weather events. Snow events have been few and far between in recent years but this winter is looking favourable to bring snow event after snow event as weather systems from the Atlantic clash with cold stagnated air over the UK he said. Current sea temperatures combined with a weather system over the north Atlantic suggest that a freezing vortex of Arctic air could hit the country later this month Yahoos Victoria Bell reported. The system will presumably descend from the North Pole ushering in a swath of low pressure spanning from Greenland to the northwest coast of Ireland. In the estimation of some meteorologists the 2019 2020 cold spell will rival the bitter winter of 1963 believed to have been the coldest in 200 years. Other weather watchers are less confident that this winter will be a record breaker. Mark Saunders for example Professor of Climate Prediction at UCL claims that there is only a 57 percent probability that this winter will be colder than last years. Late last month a group of over 500 scientists and climate professionals sent a European Climate Declaration to the Secretary General of the United Nations appealing for an open debate on climate change. Climate science should be less political while climate policies should be more scientific the declaration stated. Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation. There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes floods droughts and suchlike natural disasters or making them more frequent they continued. The declarations signers insisted that public policy must respect scientific and economic realities and not just reflect the most fashionable trend of the day. There is no climate emergency. Therefore there is no cause for panic and alarm they noted. We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050. No matter what the winter shapes up to be there is a 100 percent probability that climate alarmists will find some way to attribute the weather to global warming and carbon dioxide emissions.

Energy Secretary Rick Perry veering from the Trump administration message on climate change told CNBC on Wednesday he believes that human activity does play a role. I'm on the record as saying the climate is changing. Man it's been changing forever. Where have you been? Perry said in a Squawk Box interview when pressed on what causes climate change. The climate is changing. Are we part of the reason? Yeah it is. I'll let people debate on who's the bigger problem here. Perry did not quantify whether man made greenhouse gases associated with climate change such as carbon dioxide emissions from burning gasoline and coal or methane releases from natural gas and oil production are the main problem or even whether they're causing the immediate and growing crisis that Democrats contend. However Perry did say that it's still worth developing zero emissions technology and that the Trump administration has made great strides in cleaner energy solutions. We're going to address the climate. It makes sense for us to have policies that reduce emissions that reduce the pollutants that are in the air to reduce the particles that cause massive health problems around the world he said. Common sense tells you bring the cleaner burning fuels bring the things that bring the emissions down. That's just common sense. Perry said the administration is reducing emissions claiming without evidence or specificity that countries in the Paris climate agreement with their hair on fire when President Donald Trump announced his intention to pull out two years ago are not doing as much as the U.S. Trump has repeatedly over the years expressed skepticism about the role humans play in climate change. In 2017 then Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt told CNBC he does not believe carbon dioxide is a primary contributor. On Monday Trump talked about his administration's environmental record saying America can lead the world in fighting pollution at the same time it promotes fossil fuels. Since taking office Trump has dismantled scores of environmental rules. The U.S. has become the world's biggest oil and gas producer over the last couple of years thanks mainly to a technology led drilling boom. During the first round of the second Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday evening the 2020 hopefuls on the stage all agreed on the need to urgently address climate change but clashed over how to do it. They also talked about their own proposals to curb what they see as the man made causes as well as the merits of the Green New Deal unveiled in February by Democrats New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey.	True	False	False	True	True
New Yorks democratic socialist sweetheart Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is trying very hard to sell her idea of apocalyptic climate change or at least the side of Ocasio Cortez thats serious about climate change ending the world in 12 years is. The other side of her thinks were foolish for believing her claim that climate change will destroy the world in 12 years. She can be very confusing. It seems however that shes very confused herself specifically about how weather works. Recently Washington D.C. suffered from tornado friendly weather pushing AOC into believing that this natural disaster is simply part of the climate change disaster sweeping the globe. She also seemed disturbed at the appearance of casual tornadoes though were not exactly sure what those are and AOC did not elaborate. The climate crisis is real yall Ocasio said on Instagram. Guess were at casual tornadoes in growing regions of the country? The odd proclamation prompted meteorologist Ryan Maue to step in and offer the young Democrat a lesson in what weather is. I thought this was fake but its from Ocasio Cortezs Instagram story tweeted Maue. No idea what she means with casual tornadoes and how this line of severe thunderstorms is proof of any climate crisis he continued. Its just the weather in D.C. In a second tweet Maue pointed out that AOC doesnt seem to know the difference between weather and climate and offered her an easy analogy so that she understood for the future. Weather is what outfit you wear heading out the door tweeted Maue. Climate is your closet wardrobe. Last year climatologistJudith Curry noted that many of the world ending weather scenarios and predictions from politicians like AOC are as good as fantasy novels and told the Daily Caller that its actually impossible to predict what the climate will look like over a decade out. Projections of extreme alarming impacts are very weakly justified to borderline impossible Curry told The Daily Caller News Foundation. Currys latestresearch put together for clients of her consulting company near the end of November looks in detail at projections of sea level rise. Currys ultimate conclusion Some of the worst case scenarios strain credulity. With regards to 21st century climate projections we are dealing with deep uncertainty and we should not be basing our policies based on the assumption that the climate will actually evolve as per predicted Curry told TheDCNF. Climate variability and change is a lot more complex than CO2 as control knob Curry said. No one wants to hear this or actually spend time understanding things Curry said. Of course a lot of this alarmism from Ocasio Cortez is a weak attempt to sell her Green New Deal which already failed to pass through Congress with any yes votes. The point of the Green New Deal isnt necessarily to save the world but to push socialistic standards for America in everything from how we travel to how we farm. However everyone from economists to climate scientists to Democrat politicians have called the Green New Deal a foolish venture and after having reviewed it personally I can say its a piece of legislation thats really only good enough for kindling.

The idea started to gain traction after a fisherman spoke to Warren at the town hall event expressing concern the Green New Deal does not go far enough to address problems associated with the oceans. My oyster farm was destroyed by two hurricanes. Now warming waters and acidification are killing seed coast to coast and reducing yields. Those of us that work on the water we need climate solutions and we need them now the man said. The trouble is is the Green New Deal only mentions our oceans one time. This is despite the fact that our seas soak up more than 25 percent of the worlds carbon. So whats your plan for a Blue New Deal for those of us working on the oceans? he asked. Warren immediately embraced the idea of a Blue New Deal. I think hes got it exactly right. We need a Blue New Deal as well she continued telling the audience about her conversations with commercial fishermen who say the warming waters are making their jobs more difficult. I talk to folks who fish commercially off our shores down by New Bedford up by Gloucester. You know what they tell me? They keep pulling stuff up that they dont even know what it is. And so what do they do? I talked to one who said so Id call my brother in law who fishes commercially off the coast of Florida because I send him pictures and he says oh yeah we used to catch those down here. But now theyve moved to Boston and to the waters around Massachusetts and New England. So heres what really scares me. This isnt slowing down. Its speeding up. Where are they going next? And what are we going to be left with? We count on our oceans for life not just for food but what it means in our entire climate. You want to call it a Blue New Deal count me in. But part of getting the carbon out of the air out of the water out of the soil is also about the change in whats happening in our oceans these big dead patches now and the patches of trash. However Warren did not issue a specifics for a Blue New Deal proposal Which goes back to a point I was making earlier and that is we cant just think about cleaning up the United States of America. We cannot think about from the East Coast to the West Coast plus Hawaii and Alaska. We cant just think from the Canadian border down to the border with Mexico. We have to think about the whole world. And thats why many of my plans intersect with our global opportunities and responsibilities. Like I said lots of plans elizabethwarren.comclimate. Because weve got to be working on all fronts. Despite Warrens lack of details Democrats seem to be on board with the concept. Were trying to step into this void because most of the climate plans are really focused on the big manufacturing and industrial emitters and the big terrestrial sources of pollution said Jason Scorse director of the Center for the Blue Economy at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies and any early crafter of the Blue New Deal approach. Thats great and they should do this but there is this overlooked ocean component that can play a big role in any eventual climate solution. The ocean is a huge part of the climate system that people dont talk about and it could be part of the solution because the coastal ecosystem holds more carbon said Ayana Johnson a marine biologist and founder of Ocean Collectiv. Its not green versus blue its just that the ocean has a huge part to play in the climate system. Coasts face unbelievable change. Its not all related to climate and carbon but those are amplifying and accelerating those changes at every level from coastal infrastructure to fishery conservation said Brad Warren executive director at the National Fisheries Conservation Center. Scorse argues the U.S. needs to invest in aquaculture growing underwater plants that can capture carbon and protect against storm surges along with shellfish like oysters that help filter the water the Hill reports. It adds that a Blue New Deal would emphasize tremendous investments in coastal infrastructure. Warren has yet to roll out an official Blue New Deal proposal but her 3 trillion climate change planinspired by Washington Gov. Jay Inslee D is expansive pulling from many of her existing plans to address issues broadly related to the topic of climate change.	True	False	False	True	True
Advocates of man made climate change believe that it causes strong storms rising tides and hot temperatures and that black communities are disproportionately hurt by the effects of global warming. That was the topic at a recent roundtable discussion in Washington DC where Bloomberg Environment reported that activists at the event said Congress needed to take action. People of color have always been on the front line of this movement Alaina Beverly a former Obama White House urban affairs official who is now vice president for urban affairs at the University of Chicagos Office of Federal Relations in Washington said at the event. Were hit first and hit worst. This is our issue Beverly said. Bloomberg Environment reported on how blacks are allegedly suffering from climate change related hardships Most of the worst effects of climate change are hittingand lingering inpoor black neighborhoods in the South according to the Rev. Leo Woodberry executive director of the New Alpha Community Development Corporation in Florence S.C. In coastal South Carolina for example residents in largely black towns have been told they wont be eligible for flood insurance if they dont elevate their homes but a survey of local engineering groups showed the cost starts at 20000 for a 900 square foot house Woodberry said. In New York City many residents who die from heat stroke are African American Peggy Shepard executive director of West Harlem Environmental Action Inc. also known as WE ACT for Environmental Justice said at a Sept. 12 roundtable hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation where Beverly and Woodberry also spoke. This is about social disruption Shepard said. Extreme heat is killing thousands every year. Bloomberg Environment cited a University of California at Berkeley study that said blacks are 52 percent more likely than whites to live in so called urban heat islands where the sun beams down on brick concrete and asphalt. Theres no question that this is a topic area that black politicians including the CBC Congressional Black Caucus have not focused on as much Thomas A. LaVeist dean of Tulane Universitys School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine said in an interview. And I think its because the stereotype is that the environment is about tree hugging or saving exotic birds. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus say theyve heard the call and are working on solutions Bloomberg Environment reported. The caucus is made up of 55 African American members of the House and Senate. I think were going to be energetic in supporting any legislation that is aimed at improving the environment but I also have to tell you how congested the major issues have become Rep. Emanuel Cleaver D MO said in the Bloomberg Environment article. Cleaver said lawmakers could add language to the Federal Emergency Management Agencys FEMA budget to put resources in poor black communities and the National Flood Insurance Program could add more protections for black communities. Bloomberg Environment reported that some are already putting out legislation with this goal in mind including Reps. Maxine Waters D CA Raul Grijalva D AZ and A. Donald McEachin D VA. For African Americans and people living in urban poor communities it provides them with an empowerment tool to enforce the law to demand action and to try to get remediation done Grijalva told Bloomberg Environment. Separately Rep. Kathy Castor D Fla. chairwoman of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis is working on a climate bill to be rolled out in March that among other things will aim to help communities of color living near pollution sources Bloomberg Environment reported. Many House Democrats think theres value in putting these measures up for a vote even if they have little chance in the Senate now to send a message. The article also quoted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D NY about her Green New Deal resolution that puts social justice even above climate change. I think its backwards and shortsighted to say Well lets just throw a bunch of solar panels on everyones roof and call it a day Ocasio Cortez said. Because you cannot build a winning political coalition to fight climate change on just technocratic solutions. By fighting for the actual justice and livelihood of working people you are going to create the political energy to actually address climate change she said.	False	False	False	False	False
The Five co host Jesse Watters had some tough words for 2020 hopeful Beto O'Rourke after the former Texas representative proposed a 5 trillion climate change plan alongside the claim that the United States only had 10 years left to address the issue. If someone calls you on thephone and says you're going todie in ten years unless you giveme all your money that's ascam Watters said.He'sascam artist andeverybodyknows it. O'Rourke asserted his controversial 10 year prediction while appearing on MSNBC on Monday. He told host Chris Hayes that he sought to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. During that appearance he indicated that he would have to make himself an opponent of the oil and gas industries'interests. We know that certain oil and gas corporations have been fighting public policy on this issue have been hiding their own science and research at the expense of our climate and human life he said. OCASIO CORTEZ CALLS CLIMATE CHANGE OUR 'WORLD WAR II' WARNS THE WORLD WILL END IN 12 YEARS So whenever those two things come in contrast or in opposition I'm always going to choose the people of this country. O'Rourke also said that he wanted people in the fossil fuel industry to act as partners in reaching his goal. You have a 21 trillionU.S. economy thefossil fuel industry runs thiseconomy it'screated all of thiswealth revolutionizedtransportation communications industry lifted people out of poverty Watters said. Beto who'sdone nothingexcept lose to Sen. Ted Cruz R Texascomesup and says I'm going to take 5 trillion and I'm going to reverse everything and change it all. He's no Einstein he's no Carnegie. Where does he get off thinking he's going to stop human progress? Watters asked. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He went on to speculate that O'Rourke pushed his climate plan because he felt guilty about the American economy's success because he and other liberals have not had enough input in it. O'Rourke's program was an ambitious endeavor similar to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez's D N.Y. Green New Deal which many saw as too expensive and unrealistic. When Ocasio Cortezresponded to O'Rourke's plan she said he didn't have an aggressive enough timeline.	False	True	False	True	False
After years of failing to pass a carbon tax climate hawks are now rallying behind a bold new proposal for tackling global warming. Known as the Green New Deal this economic stimulus package for the planet promises to dramatically cut carbon emissions through government spending on clean energy jobs technologies and infrastructure. The main selling point of the Green New Deal has been its politics. While carbon pricing has long been touted as the most cost effective policy for reducing emissions it has struggled to gain legislative traction. By contrast advocates of the Green New Deal believe their proposal can build a winning coalition by reframing climate policy as a story of economic growth and opportunity. A Green New Deal is not just good politics. It is good economics. Society can combat climate change by using existing clean technologies to cut emissions today or by innovating new clean technologies to cut emissions in the future. We need both strategies to address global warming. Every second that we delay in reducing our carbon footprint imposes costs on ourselves and on countless future generations. If we want to avoid climate catastrophe we need to make deep cuts in emissions soon. On the other hand the challenges and costs of relying solely on current technologies to address climate change are prohibitively high. We need investments in clean innovation to make it cheaper to reduce emissions in the future. We could achieve the twin goals of slashing emissions and spurring innovation by putting a very high price on greenhouse gases. Carbon taxes can encourage industries to both reduce their footprints and develop cheaper clean technologies. However carbon pricing by itself is not the most efficient climate policy. As we explain in a recent paper the cheaper and faster approach for our society is to combine a moderately sized carbon tax with significant federal spending on the development and deployment of clean technologies. While carbon pricing is the most cost effective way to reduce emissions today government subsidies are the most cost effective way to advance clean technologies tomorrow. The intuition behind all this is simple. Policies work best when they are narrowly tailored to the behavior that they seek to alter. Thus if we want markets to produce more clean innovation we should reward innovators rather than penalize polluters in the hopes that doing so will indirectly induce them to produce innovation. The benefits of directly encouraging clean innovation are striking. Economists have estimated our society can save more than 1.4 trillion a year if governments used a combination of taxes and subsidies rather than taxes only to address climate change. In short good economics calls for the type of broad federal spending on clean innovation that the Green New Deal promises to deliver. Of course the effectiveness of the proposal at spurring innovation will depend on its design the exact details of which have yet to be ironed out. The package should increase funding for early stage clean energy research as this kind of basic science is usually too risky to attract private investors. The Green New Deal should also include subsidies for the adoption and deployment of clean technologies such as tax credits for clean energy investment and manufacturing. These types of policies that help emerging technologies scale up and mature can be powerful drivers of clean energy innovation. Critics will undoubtedly argue that we cannot afford the Green New Deal. This line of attack however ignores the costs of inaction. While the Green New Deal will not be cheap its price pales in comparison to the damage that unchecked climate change will inflict on the economy. This argument also ignores the savings that will result from the push toward clean energy innovation under the Green New Deal. The development of cheaper clean technologies should more than offset the costs of the stimulus package. Opponents will also claim that the government is a bad venture capitalist and that a Green New Deal will pour taxpayer dollars into clean energy boondoggles. While concerns about government waste are certainly real they can be avoided through smart policy design. The government can encourage innovation without favoring particular clean technologies or companies by enacting neutral research and development tax credits. The ideal economic climate policy does include carbon pricing. But we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Even if the government cannot enact the best policy for cutting emissions today it can still use the best policy for advancing clean innovation tomorrow. The Green New Deal pushes climate policy into uncharted political waters but it does so based on sound economic theories. If we want to save the planet for the least amount of money we need the Green New Deal and we need it now. Quentin Karpilow is a law clerk in the federal judiciary. Zachary Liscow is an economist and a professor at Yale Law School who has served on the staff of the White House Council of Economic Advisors. The views are their own.	True	False	False	True	True
The president of an island nation on the frontline of climate change says it is in a fight to the death after freak waves inundated the capital. Powerful swells averaging 5m 16ft washed across the capital of the Marshall Islands Majuro last week. But President Hilda Heine said the Pacific nation had been fighting rising tides even before last week's disaster. Political leaders and climate diplomats are meeting in Madrid for two weeks of talks amid a growing sense of crisis. This conference of the parties or COP25 was due to be held in Chile but was cancelled by the government due to weeks of civil disturbances. Spain then stepped in to host the event which will see 29000 attendees over the two weeks of talks. Climate change Where we are in seven charts The world's average surface temperature is rising rapidly because human activities release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide CO2. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere a bit like the glass roof of a greenhouse. At the meeting Ms Heine commented Water covers much of our land at one or other point of the year as we fight rising tides. As we speak hundreds of people have evacuated their homes after large waves caused the ocean to inundate parts of our capital in Majuro last week. She added It's a fight to the death for anyone not prepared to flee. As a nation we refuse to flee. But we also refuse to die. Ms Heine is not alone in the view that small nations like the Marshall Islands face an imminent existential threat. At the Madrid summit ambassador Lois Young from the Alliance of Small Island States AOSIS which represents low lying coastal countries and small island nations launched a rebuke to the world's big polluters. We are disappointed by inadequate action by developed countries and outraged by the dithering and retreat of one of the most culpable polluters from the Paris Agreement she said. In the midst of a climate emergency retreat and inaction are tantamount to sanctioning ecocide. They reflect profound failure to honour collective global commitment to protect the most vulnerable. With our very existence at stake COP 25 must demonstrate unprecedented ambition to avert ecocide. The COP25 meeting will aim to step up ambition so that all countries increase their national commitments to cut emissions. The meeting follows on the heels of three UN reports which stressed the increased urgency of limiting dangerous climate change. According to UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres the point of no return is no longer over the horizon. Speaking ahead of the meeting he said political leaders had to respond to the imminent climate crisis. In the crucial 12 months ahead it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments particularly from the main emitters to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature based solutions Mr Guterres said. Almost every country in the world has now signed and ratified the Paris climate agreement and under the terms of the pact they will all have to put new climate pledges on the table before the end of 2020. This meeting in Madrid signals the start of a frantic 12 months of negotiations that will culminate in Glasgow with COP26 in November next year. Some 50 world leaders are expected to attend the meeting in the Spanish capital but US President Donald Trump will not be among them. The US became a signatory to the landmark Paris climate agreement in April 2016 under the Obama administration. But President Trump has said the accord which has been signed by more than 190 countries would lead to lost jobs and lower wages for American workers. Last month he began the process of withdrawing from the Paris deal. However Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi will attend the conference with a congressional delegation. While her presence has been welcomed US environmentalists want to see concrete steps on climate. While it's great Speaker Pelosi is coming to Madrid in place of Trump symbolic gestures are no substitute for bold action said Jean Su from the US Center for Biological Diversity. America remains the number one historic contributor to the climate emergency and even Democratic politicians have never committed to taking responsibility for our fair share. Underlining the real world impacts of climate change a report from the charity Save the Children says that what it calls climate shocks are threatening tens of millions of people in East and Southern Africa. The charity says 33 million people are at emergency levels of food insecurity due to cyclones and droughts. More than half of these are believed to be children. The situation has been made worse because the two strongest cyclones ever to hit the African continent affected the same region just weeks apart. Cyclone Idai struck Mozambique Zimbabwe and Malawi last March while six weeks later Cyclone Kenneth slammed Mozambique with millions affected by flooding. The climate crisis is happening here and it's killing people forcing them from their homes and ruining children's chance of a future said Ian Vale from Save the Children.	False	False	False	True	False
In February a group of high profile Republicans announced their support for a plan that would tax carbon dioxide emissions in order to slow global warming which they believe to be caused by humans. According to the group which is led by former Secretaries of State James Baker III and George Shultz and former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson their plan would tax fossil fuel companies and redistribute the funds back to Americans in equal portions thereby artificially raising the price of fossil fuels and making renewable energy sources more competitive. Now left wing climate alarmists are seizing on this idea which some say is the only policy idea attempting to limit fossil fuels the American people and the Trump administration would be willing to support. Climate alarmists have long advocated for a carbon tax in varying forms as one possible solution to the purported global warming crisis. In a recent interview with the Scientific American noted climate alarmist James Hansen which the article refers to as the father of climate change awareness said the plan promoted by Republicans is similar to one he developed in 2008 and would be popular with the American people. The only effective way of addressing climate change is to make the price of fossil fuels include their cost to society said Hansen. That could be done in a simple way by collecting a fee from the fossil fuel companies that would gradually rise over timea carbon fee and dividend. I call it a carbon fee because you would give all of the money to the public a dividend to each legal resident Hansen said. have adopted almost precisely as I proposed it in 2008. The starting level of the fee varies from one proposition to anotherI believe that they start at 40 per ton of carbon. suggest 55 per ton yields a dividend of 1000 per legal resident and 3000 for a family with two or more children with one half share for each child a maximum of two half shares per family. Hansen claims by imposing the tax and then redistributing the money to consumers the increased price of gasoline would be offset and Americans would be happy having received thousands of extra dollars from the government. This way it actually stimulates the economy Hansen said. If its a tax taken by the government it makes the government bigger and it depresses the economy. Thats why I object to the Democrats as much as to the Republicans. The only way the public will allow a carbon fee is if you give the money to thempeople dont want to see the price of gasoline at the pump going up. The Washington Post reported on April 4 sources inside the Trump administration say the president is considering including a carbon tax as one way to help raise revenues. The Post also reported the sources claimed the carbon tax proposal is very controversial and that some within the administration are staunchly opposed to it. Carbon taxes are viewed by many on the left as an easy way to price fossil fuels out of the marketplace making renewable energy comparably more affordable. Opponents of the plan say its another form of socialistic wealth distribution that will dramatically raise energy costs. Opponents say energy costs will increase not only because of the tax but also because energy companies will raise prices across the board knowing that all consumers have more money to spend thanks to carbon tax dividends.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren D MA on Friday praised the climate change activists who are striking on Black Friday urging them to stay strong in this fight! Climate change activists across the globe opted to protest what they consider a climate crisis on the biggest shopping day of the year disrupting shoppers at the Water Tower Place shopping mall in Chicago Illinois and holding a Black Friday Funeral For Future in the nations capital Warren emphatically expressed her support for their efforts. Climate change is an existential threat and its going to take a grassroots movement ready to fight for big structural change to defeat it Warren wrote. Im standing with the young activists on todaystay strong in this fight! While protests indeed broke out across the globe the protest in D.C. featured a funeral procession to draw attention to the crisis and show that business as usual can not continue. Well gather on the Southeast lawn of the Capitol to eulogize and mourn all that has been lost and all that is threatened by the climate crisis the events description reads. All those with hopes and dreams who cherish the future are invited to gather in the shadow of the Halls of Congress. The ceremonial closed casket funeral will conclude with a funeral procession through the streets of Washington DC it added quoting activists who called petroleum a plague and the black death of our generation. Were bringing the loss of our future to the steps of the Capitol because they need to prepare to own this death 17 year old organizer Maddie Graham said. We need systemic change. Congress has been feeding our fossil fuel addiction Graham added. They know they are killing our future but they wont take action to save it. Meanwhile Warren has attempted to channel Gov. Jay Inslees D climate change proposals in recent months. Warren said during an interview with New Hampshire Public Radio in October We do those three things we cut carbon emission in our country by 70 percent. Think about that three things 70 percent reduction she added. The host asked Warren a listener question name the specific steps she has taken in her campaign to ensure that your campaigns environmental impact is limited as possible. Warren did not go into detail but claimed that she mostly flies commercial. So Ive mostly been flying commercial Warren said. Its everything from the kind of car we drive and down to do we purchase offsets? Can we make that work s a way to try to reduce the footprint she added	False	False	False	True	False
A Trump administration presentation extolling the virtues of fossil fuels at the UN climate talks in Poland has been met with guffaws of laughter and chants of Shame on you. Mondays protest came during a panel discussion by the official US delegation which used its only public appearance to promote the unapologetic utilisation of coal oil and gas. Although these industries are the main source of the carbon emissions that are causing global warming the speakers boasted the US would expand production for the sake of global energy security and planned a new fleet of coal plants with technology it hoped to export to other countries. The event featured prominent cheerleaders for fossil fuels and nuclear power including Wells Griffith Donald Trumps adviser on global energy and climate Steve Winberg the assistant secretary for fossil energy at the energy department and Rich Powell the executive director of the ClearPath Foundation a non profit organisation focused on conservative clean energy. The only non American was Patrick Suckling the ambassador for the environment in Australias coal enthusiast government. None of the US participants mentioned climate change or global warming focusing instead of innovation and entrepreneurship in the technological development of nuclear power clean coal and carbon capture and storage. Ten minutes into Griffiths opening speech he was interrupted by a sudden sustained loud volley of laughter by several dozen protesters that was then followed by a single shout of Its not funny and then a series of chants of Keep it in the ground and Shame on you. Several campaigners read statements. There is no such thing as clean coal. Coal is deadly from the beginning to the end. They talk about the life cycle of coal I talk about it as a death march. My father died of black lung and I am in this struggle with others whose fathers and husbands are dying of black lung right now said Teri Blanton of Kentuckians for the Commonwealth which represents Appalachian coal workers in North America. After the protesters were led away by security guards Griffiths said In the US our policy is not to keep it in the ground but to use it as cleanly and efficiently as possible. This statement was contradicted by climate analysts who noted the US environment agency estimates that 1400 more deaths per year will result from Trumps proposal to replace the Clean Power Act. Its ludicrous for Trump officials to claim that they want to clean up fossil fuels while dismantling standards that would do just that said Dan Lashof the director of the World Resources Institute. Since taking office this administration has proposed to roll back measures to cut methane leaks from oil and gas operations made it easier for companies to dump coal ash into drinking water and just days ago proposed easing carbon pollution rules for new coal fired power plants. Griffith boasted the US had the largest coal reserves in the world and iwas producing more petroleum than ever. To achieve economic growth and eradicate poverty all energy uses are important and they will be utilised unapologetically he said. Echoing a claim often made by Trump Griffiths said the US would not be subject to agreements that hamstrung domestic growth while allowing China to operate with high emissions. This was the second consecutive year that the Trump team was heckled after promoting fossil fuels and nuclear power at the climate talks underscoring how the US position has shifted since the president took power in 2017. The US was a key player in forging the Paris agreement in 2015 but its standing has steadily eroded since. In 2017 Trump announced he would pull the US out of the global accord. This year his representatives have taken a still more destructive stance by aligning with Russia Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to try to downgrade a key report by the worlds scientists that warned of the dangers of global warming moving beyond 1.5C above pre industrial levels. None of the panelists would be drawn on the study but Griffith spoke out against alarmism that he claimed displaced pragmatic solutions to address environmental concerns with prescriptive regulations that put jobs at risk and raised costs for consumers. In fact scientists say their forecasts about climate impacts have been too conservative while economists say the shift to renewables has resulted in cheaper energy for many users. Winberg said the US government was planning to support a new fleet of small modular coal plants that he claimed would be energy efficient and have near zero emissions if combined with carbon capture technology. After initial development in the US he said they could be exported to other countries. They offer opportunity for developing nations to access tomorrows coal technology to improve energy security he said. He also proposed more pipelines to oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite this public commitment the US use of coal is declining because renewables are cheaper according to Nathaniel Keohane the senior vice president for the Environmental Defense Fund nonprofit group. Trump is playing politics but its not changing the facts on the ground he said. Coal usage in the US just hit a 39 year low. If we really want to protect our economy well move aggressively toward 100 clean energy. An alternative non official US delegation has backed a faster transition to renewables. Made up of city and state level governments business executives and religious leaders the Were still in group is staging dozens of events in a bid to show action is still possible without White House support. Nonetheless many observers at the official US panel were ashamed at the position of their federal government. I was completely embarrassed to be an American said Leo McNeil Woodberry of the Climate Action Network. Everything they proposed was absolutely wrong. I cant believe they are putting profits over the planet and profits over people.	True	False	False	False	True
The White House shot down rumors Tuesday that administration officials were considering a tax on carbon dioxide emissions. The Washington Post published a story on Tuesday citing two Trump administration officials who said a carbon tax and value added tax or VAT were under consideration as part of a broader tax reform plan. But the White House quickly disavowed the statements allegedly made by the two officials marking the second time in three weeks the Trump administration has had to shoot down carbon tax rumors. As we have said many times the Presidents team is hearing input from experts on all sides of the tax reform debate as we formulate what will ultimately be the Presidents plan to enact the first significant tax reform since 1986 deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement responding to WaPosstory. As of now neither a carbon tax nor a VAT are under consideration Walters said. Walters told reporters in March the Trump administration is not considering a carbon tax after press secretary Sean Spicer waffled on the question. White House officials met with a group of Republicans who back a carbon tax in early February. Spicer did not respond to a request for comment. A small group of Republicans have been pushing a carbon tax for years arguing its more efficient than federal regulations and could be used to offset revenue losses from reductions in tax rates. Most recently old guard Republicans on the Climate Leadership Council CLC met with White House officials to pitch a carbon tax that would start at 40 per ton and rise over the years. CLC says the tax could replace federal regulations and the revenues could be given back to Americans in the form of dividends. Many carbon tax proposals are revenue neutral reads the Councils plan. This proposal goes one step further by shrinking the overall size of government and streamlining the regulatory state. The meeting sparked speculation that the White House was considering a carbon tax as part of a broader tax reform plan. Many carbon tax plans claim to raise 1 trillion over ten years. The White House has shot down such speculation but some administration officials seem intent on telling media outlets a carbon tax is still being considered. Most Republicans dont buy into a carbon tax. They argue its not very conservative to back what would essentially amount to a tax on energy which would effectively raise the price of all goods and services. President Donald Trump told the American Energy Alliance in a survey taken during the campaign that he opposed a carbon tax and the Obama administrations social cost of carbon estimate. Trump signed an executive order in late March rescinding the Obama administrations social cost of carbon estimate. Trump also ordered the Environmental Protection Agency EPA to review and possibly rescind the Clean Power Plan the cornerstone of the former administrations global warming agenda. Conservative activists point out theres no deal to be made on trading federal environmental regulations for a carbon tax since Trumps already promised to roll back 75 percent of federal rules. If the Trump Administration were to endorse this idea they would not only be breaking a campaign commitment but would essentially be negotiating against themselves on regulations said Tom Pyle president of the American Energy Alliance and former member of Trumps transition team.

Trump administration officials are keeping their lips sealed on whether they believe there are connections between the two Category 4 hurricanes that came barreling at the United States in recent weeks Harvey and Irma and climate change. When Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked about a link Monday she touted the country's environmental record and moved on. When Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert was asked as he preceded Huckabee Sanders in the briefing he wouldn't talk about climate change's cause. 'I will tell you that we continue to take seriously the climate change' he said. 'Not the cause of it but the things that we observe.' 'Causality is something outside my ability to analyze right now' Bossert also added. When President Trump was asked about it Sunday returning home to the White House from Camp David he simply ignored the reporter's query and walked inside. Climate scientists largely agree that the oceans are heating up leading to larger scarier hurricanes. At Monday's briefing Huckabee Sanders dismissed a climate change question noting that Trump had addressed the issue previously of whether he thought it was man made. In the past Trump has suggested climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese to choke American industry. In June he pulled the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Huckabee Sanders was also asked if Trump was re thinking that decision now. 'I'm not sure specifically on the Paris climate deal but as he said at the time the goal is to always do the very best when taking care of the environment and taking proper steps' Huckabee Sanders replied. 'The United States is one of the best in the world at doing this we want to continue to do that but right now the administration is focused on the recovery and the relief efforts and as Tom Bossert said a few minutes ago we'll look at that analysis once we get through the coming days and focus on the recovery and relief and saving life effort' Huckabee Sanders added. Bossert had suggested that the hurricanes be studied though also pointed out the cyclical nature of the seasons. 'And I think the scientists for the forecast on this particular one they were dead on that this would be a stronger more powerful hurricane season with slightly more than average large storms making landfall in the United States' he said. 'So we'll have to do a larger trend analysis at a later date' Bossert added. The Environmental Protection Agency's Scott Pruitt went one step further when asked about climate change Friday suggesting that it wasn't appropriate. 'To have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm versus helping people or actually facing the effect of the storm is misplaced' Pruitt said. Of course the scientific community as the New York Times put it believes that'drawing links between warming global temperatures and the ferocity of hurricanes is about as controversial as talking about geology after an earthquake.' But in politics it's become a heated issue that speaks to the current red versus blue divide. And while it's primarily Republicans who won't touch the global warming third rail that doesn't always hold true. On Sunday Sen. John McCain R Fla. who has preached bipartisanship in recent months on the heels of his cancer diagnosis told CNN's Jake Tapper that he didn't know why his Republican colleagues were denying climate change adding that it was 'time to sit down.' 'We have to understand that the climate may be changing and we can take common sense measures which will not harm the American people' McCain argued.	True	False	False	True	True
President Donald Trump picked West Virginia to announce his plan to reduce pollution controls on coal fired power plants which is no surprise. West Virginia loves coal and coal miners love Trump but what both of them may not love is the fact that a reduction in pollution controls is going to greatly increase the number of people who die prematurely from pollution created by burning coal. It will also greatly increase the number of people who get sick with serious illnesses such as heart and lung problems. When he made his announcement somehow Trump left out those details of the life threatening side effects of using coal to create electrical energy. Even though they will be getting sick and dying at higher rates it is not expected that Trumps actions will reduce his popularity among West Virginians. An analysis done by his own Environmental Protection Agency EPA concludes that the rollback of Obama era pollution controls will lead to many more people dying and suffering health problems that they otherwise would not have. Clean air controls since the 1980s stopped the columns of black soot that used to rise from coal smokestacks in the region. The clean air rules reduced the number of people dying from coal fired power plants substantially. Technology has changed and now pollutants rise from smokestacks as gases before solidifying into invisible particles small enough to pass through lungs and into bloodstreams. An EPA analysis says those pollutants would increase under Trumps plan when compared to what would happen under the Obama rules. This will result in many thousands of more heart attacks asthma problems and other illnesses than would have happened without Trumps new rules. The EPA says up to 1500 more people will die each year under Trumps plan. And the areas that will be hit the hardest are in Trump country the coal mining regions of West Virginia. There could be dozens of new deaths and hundreds of new serious illnesses each year because of Trumps plan. Obamas Clean Power Plan targeted climate changing carbon dioxide and would have curbed harmful emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants from the coal fired power plants. It would have increased federal regulation of emissions from the nations electrical grid and broadly promoted natural gas solar power and other cleaner energy. Trumps Affordable Clean Energy program will dismantle President Barack Obamas 2015 Clean Power Plan which has not yet been implemented due to court battles. Trumps plan will give up much of the federal oversight of existing coal fired power plants. Not only that but the government will no longer promote cleaner energy. Individual states will decide how much to regulate coal power plants in their own states. At his public announcement Trump said Im getting rid of some of these ridiculous rules and regulations which are killing our companies and our jobs. There was no mention of the increases in harmful emissions that would result compared to the Obama plan or the health risks. In West Virginia coal is popular and politicians who support coal get elected. Vivian Stockman of the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition was protesting outside Trumps rally. Our state is beholden to coal. Our politicians are beholden to coal. Meanwhile our people are being poisoned she said.	False	False	False	False	False
How Luxury Hotels And Restaurants In Developing Countries Fight Food Waste If you've never considered what happens to the remnants of the fully loaded plate of enchiladas chips and salsa you grab from the buffet at an all inclusive Mexico resort you might be in for a shock. Mexico's Velas Vallarta produces a veritable ton of food waste each day but rather than dumping it into the trash the Puerto Vallarta resort delivers roughly 700 pounds of it each morning to a hog farmer down the road to use as feed. Much of what doesn't go to the pigs is composted on site and then used to fertilize the resort's verdant gardens. Ultimately the combo of food waste leaves and grass trimmings are returned to the soil while diverting waste from Mexico's overloaded landfills. Compost is also shared with staff for use at their homes. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that nearly a quarter of food purchases in hotels and restaurants are simply thrown away. While food waste is a hot topic in the U.S. it's a particular challenge in low income nations where food is sometimes a scarce resource to begin with. Some resorts are doing their part to address it even when governmental regulations and a general lack of awareness make that difficult. In Brazil food safety regulations prevent restaurants from giving away food yet 52 million Brazilians are still threatened by food insecurity according to 2014 research by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Meanwhile the country produces almost more food waste than any other nation with 40000 tons wasted each day according to research by the Brazilian Company of Agriculture. That amount of food could feed 19 million people. But in the booming city of Rio de Janeiro a luxury hotel has been turning trash into treasure for more than a decade long before food waste was at the forefront of anyone's mind. The glamorous Belmond Copacabana Palace you know the place where you might see Madonna or Mick Jagger hanging off the balcony was among the country's first hotels to implement a restaurant waste management system in 2008. Today Copacabana Palace recycles more than 1800 gallons of cooking oil and composts nearly all of its food waste but not before crushing it to reduce its volume by 88 percent. For many hotels simple knowledge of the issue has resulted in greater observance from staff and ultimately less waste. When Soneva Fushi a luxury resort in the Maldives conducted a comprehensive food waste audit in 2016 employees sorted weighed and recorded waste for a full week ultimately establishing exactly how much food was wasted per guest down to the gram. I think part of the benefit of a detailed audit like this is that it increases everyone's mindfulness about what they are doing with food says Gordon Jackson the manager of the resort's Waste to Wealth initiative. This has really helped everybody throughout the food and beverage team and the organization as a whole just to think about what they are doing. Since the audit the resort has seen a 50 percent reduction in the amount of waste sent to compost. While it's easier for large hotels and resorts to fund audits and enlist comprehensive waste management systems smaller properties have found low cost ways to reduce their environmental footprint too. When Anita Ritter opened her Island Hideout resort in Koh Yao Noi Thailand a year and a half ago she was shocked by how challenging waste management was on her small sleepy island but a few innovative ideas have brought the resort's food waste to almost zero. Ritter composts much of her property's organic waste to use as fertilizer but she's found uses for compost byproducts too. Compost juice sometimes called bokashi gets a new life as a cleaning fluid used at the resort. It is a very efficient cleaner for clogged drains perfect to clean toilets and sinks and is a very good odor remover she says. Leftover Kaffir limes used in the property's homemade limeade are repurposed in cleaning products. It helps give other islanders something to think about Ritter explains. As we use and reuse things it gives us some social engagement status. In May I experienced one hotel's efforts firsthand as I stood on the roof at ITC Maurya a hotel in Delhi. It was more than 100 degrees outside and flies swarmed above vats of leftover naan and curry from the hotel's five restaurants including Bukhara arguably the world's most famous Indian restaurant. Next to the putrid mix stood a stainless steel tank full of in a sense money all in the form of decaying rotting food. That pricy leftover food the hotel produces more than 1300 pounds of it per day was in the process of being converted to biogas a methane and carbon dioxide mix that's a result of decomposing food. Ultimately the resulting biogas powers the staff cafeteria. The hotel also collects around 100 pounds of waste from the community each day using the same process to convert it into fuel. ITC Maurya's BioUrja plant was a more significant investment than reusing lime peels and bokashi. The plant which consists of a giant digester a pressure vessel scrubbers and an automation panel was installed in June 2016 and cost around 45 lakh or roughly 65000. Still the hotel expects the project to break even in about four years. In the meantime the digester will chug along reducing waste one bowl of leftover dal at a time.	False	False	False	False	False
Upside down rivers of warm ocean water may be one of the causes of Antarctica's ice shelves breaking up leading to a rise in sea levels. A new study suggests that in the past increases in Antarctic sea ice in colder climates may have contributed to ice ages. Using computer simulations the research looked at past changes during the glacial periods and noted that previous increases in sea ice levels may have significantly altered the circulation of the ocean which led to a reverse greenhouse effect as carbon dioxide levels in the ocean increased and levels in the air decreased. One key question in the field is still what caused the Earth to periodically cycle in and out of ice ages University of Chicago professor and the study's co author Malte Jansen said in a statement. We are pretty confident that the carbon balance between the atmosphere and ocean must have changed but we dont quite know how or why. ANTARCTICA'S ICE SHEETS CONTAIN RADIOACTIVE CHLORINE GAS 60 YEARS AFTER NUCLEAR TESTS STUDY SAYS The last major ice age ended at the end of the Pleistocene epoch about 11700 years ago as glaciers have periodically grown and then gotten smaller. Researchers believe that changes to the Earth's orbit may be partly responsible for some of the Earth's cooling but additional factors have likely played a part Jensen added. The most plausible explanation is that there was some change in how carbon was divided between the atmosphere and the ocean Jansen continued. Theres no shortage of ideas about how this happens but its not quite clear how they all fit together. Researchers also believe a mini ice age may have occurred roughly 12800 years ago. It likely stems from an asteroid impact that rocked the Northern Hemisphere and led to the Younger Dryas climate event. Jansen pointed out that the Southern Ocean around Antarctica plays a key role in ocean circulation due to the deep waters in the region leading it to have outsized consequences. AIR POLLUTION MORE DEADLY THAN SMOKING NEW STUDY FINDS What this suggests is that its a feedback loop said the study's lead author Alice Marzocchi. As the temperature drops less carbon is released into the atmosphere which triggers more cooling. What surprised me is how much of this increased storage can be attributed to physical changes alone with Antarctic sea ice cover being the key player Marzocchi added noting that future study of the ocean and the role it plays in the carbon cycle can help simulate future environmental change. The research has been published in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience.

New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez on Monday unveilednew details on the so called Green New Deal she plans to introduce in a matter of days as she worked behind the scenes to rally congressional support for the proposal that could cost as much as 7 trillion. Ocasio Cortez who is set to unveil the plan with Massachusetts Democratic Sen.Ed Markey told her fellow representatives in a letter that the Green New Deal calls for anational social industrial and economic mobilization at a scale not seen since World War II. Next week we plan to release a resolution that outlines the scope and scale of the Green New Deal Ocasio Cortez said in the letter adding that the country's near totaleconomic transformationshould take approximately ten years. To raise awareness for the measureMarkey announced Monday he had invitedVarshini Prakash the co founder of the Sunrise Movement environmentalist group to be his guest at President Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday night. Several other Democrats announced guests apparently intended to highlight their opposition to various Trump administration policies while Trump himself extended invites to the family of a couple allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrantand a child bullied at school for having the last name Trump. The Green New Deal proposal would lead to national net zero greenhouse gas emissions according to Ocasio Cortez'sletter through a fair and just transition for all communities and workers while also generating millions of good high wage jobs. Details of the letter were first published by Bloomberg. ANALYSIS GREEN NEW DEAL IS MOST RADICAL LEGISLATION IN DECADES Through it all the Green New Deal would additionally promote justice and equity by preventing current and repairing historic oppression to frontline and vulnerable communities according to Ocasio Cortez. On Twitter Monday Ocasio Cortez reposted a claim from one of her advisersRobert Hockett arguing that in this case size matters and that the problems the Green New Deal addresses require solutions where bigger is better imperative and paraodixcally more affordable. Hockett is a lawyer and law professor and is not an expert in environmental policy. Severalanalysts meanwhile have cautioned that the liberal firebrand is in over her head even though the as yet vague and uncertain details about the Green New Deal render a precise calculation impossible at the moment. Physicist Christopher Clack told The Hillthat the cost would easily be into the trillions. Its a daunting task and Im not sure that the authors of the Green New Deal fully comprehend how much theyll need Clack said. Institute for Energy Research president Tom Pyle was more blunt One hundred percent renewable energy defies the laws of physics. It would be impossible to achieve. And Paul Bledsoe a strategic adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute said progressives were overcompensating. I understand the value of aspirational goals Bledsoesaid. My personal view is that undermines the credibility of the effort. Nevertheless approximately 70 Democraticlawmakers have so far tentativelyendorsed aGreen New Deal plan including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris. House speaker Nancy Pelosi who has vowed to address climate change has not publicly signed onto the plan even though scores of progressive activists joined by Ocasio Cortez staged a sit in at her House office late last year demanding action on the climate. While there is no legislative text yet available for the MarkeyOcasio Cortez proposal adraft circulated by Ocasio Cortez last weekcalled for a committee to be formed to create a plan and lays out a framework that includes eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture whiledramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources. To coverwhat would presumably be a gargantuan cost it envisions financing by the federal government using a combination of the Federal Reserve a new public bank or system of regional and specialized public banks public venture funds and such other vehicles or structures that the select committee deems appropriate in order to ensure that interest and other investment returns generated from public investments made in connection with the plan will be returned to the treasury reduce taxpayer burden and allow for more investment. As it stands any such proposal would be almost certainly dead on arrival in the Republican controlled Senate and also possibly the House where it is not clear if a majority of Democrats would back a plan. Even if Congress managed to pass a version of the Green New Deal the White House could veto the legislation anda two thirds majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate would be needed to override the veto. The Trump administrationhas made clear it would not accept Ocasio Cortez's proposals. In January White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders derided Ocasio Cortez'srecent claim that theworld will end in 12 yearsdue to climate change andsuggested the Trump administration has little need for the progressive firebrand'sthoughts in general. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP I don't think we'regoing to listen to Ocasio Cortez on much of anything particularly not on matters we're gonna leave in the hands of a much much higher authority and certainly not listen to the freshman congresswoman on when the world may end Sanders told Fox News' Hannity. Speaking at an eventcommemoratingMartin Luther King Day that monthOcasio Cortez asserted thatclimate change constituted our World War II and added Millennials and people you know Gen Z and all these folks that will come after us are looking up and were like The world is gonna end in 12 years if we dont address climate change and your biggest issue is how are we gonna pay for it?'

HAZARD Ky. AP A coalition of left leaning states and environmental groups are vowing to fight the Trump administration's move to kill an Obama era effort to limit carbon emissions from coal fired power plants. Speaking Monday in the coal mining state of Kentucky Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt said he would be issuing a new set of rules overriding the Clean Power Plan the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's drive to curb global climate change. The war on coal is over Pruitt declared adding that no federal agency should ever use its authority to declare war on any sector of our economy. It was not immediately clear if Pruitt would seek to issue a new rule without congressional approval which Republicans had criticized the Obama administration for doing. Pruitt's rule wouldn't become final for months and is then highly likely to face a raft of legal challenges. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was among those who said they will sue. The Trump Administration's persistent and indefensible denial of climate change and their continued assault on actions essential to stemming its increasing devastation is reprehensible and I will use every available legal tool to fight their dangerous agenda said Schneiderman a Democrat. For Pruitt getting rid of the Clean Power Plan will mark the culmination of a long fight he began as the elected attorney general of Oklahoma. Pruitt was among about two dozen attorney generals who sued to stop Obama's 2014 push to limit carbon emissions stymieing the limits from ever taking effect. Closely aligned with the oil and gas industry in his home state Pruitt rejects the consensus of scientists that man made emissions from burning fossil fuels are the primary driver of global climate change. President Donald Trump who appointed Pruitt and shares his skepticism of established climate science promised to kill the Clean Power Plan during the 2016 campaign as part of his broader pledge to revive the nation's struggling coal mines. In his order Tuesday Pruitt is expected to declare that the Obama era rule exceeded federal law by setting emissions standards that power plants could not reasonably meet. Pruitt appeared at an event with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at Whayne Supply in Hazard Kentucky a company that sells coal mining supplies. The store's owners have been forced to lay off about 60 percent of its workers in recent years. While cheering the demise of the Clean Power Plan as a way to stop the bleeding McConnell conceded most of those lost jobs are never coming back. A lot of damage has been done said McConnell a Kentucky Republican. This doesn't immediately bring everything back but we think it stops further decline of coal fired plants in the United States and that means there will still be some market here. Obama's plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions. The Supreme Court put the plan on hold last year following legal challenges by industry and coal friendly states. Even so the plan helped drive a recent wave of retirements of coal fired plants which are also being squeezed by low cost natural gas and renewable power. In the absence of stricter federal regulations curbing greenhouse gas emissions many states have issued their own mandates promoting energy conservation. The withdrawal of the Clean Power Plan is the latest in a series of moves by Trump and Pruitt to dismantle Obama's legacy on fighting climate change including the delay or roll back of rules limiting levels of toxic pollution in smokestack emissions and wastewater discharges from coal burning power plants. On Thursday Trump nominated former coal industry lobbyist Andrew Wheeler to serve as Pruitt's top deputy at EPA one of several recent political appointees at the agency with direct ties to the fossil fuel interests. The president announced earlier this year that he will pull the United States out of the landmark Paris climate agreement. Nearly 200 countries have committed to combat global warming by reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. This president has tremendous courage Pruitt said Monday. He put America first and said to the rest of the world we are going to say no and exit the Paris Accord. That was the right thing to do. Despite the rhetoric about saving coal government statistics show that coal mines currently employ only about 52000 workers nationally a modest 4 percent uptick since Trump became president. Those numbers are dwarfed by the jobs created by building such clean power infrastructure as wind turbines and solar arrays. Trump is not just ignoring the deadly cost of pollution he's ignoring the clean energy deployment that is rapidly creating jobs across the country said Michael Brune executive director of the Sierra Club. Associated Press writer Michael Biesecker reported from Washington. Follow him at This story has been corrected to show the percentage of coal jobs created under Trump was 4 percent.

Taking hisprevious statementseven further Interior Secretary David Bernhardt told lawmakers Tuesday that he is not obligated to combat climate change because there is no law requiring that he do so. Bernhardt responded by noting that there are over 600 instances in the law directing the Interior Department secretary to do certain things including completing reports and making certain authorizations but he said there is no such mandate for addressing planetary warming. You know what theres not is a shall for I shall manage the land to stop climate change or something similar to that he said pointing the finger at Congress. The hearing was the first of two appearances Bernhardt has before Congress this week to defend the Trump administrations 2020 budget request which calls for a 14 cut in funding for the Department of the Interior. But a good portion of the discussion focused on climate change environmental protections and an ethics investigation against Bernhardt and several other agency officials. A sobering United Nations report released Monday found that up to 1 million species of land and marine species are at risk of extinction due to human actions. Neither Bernhardt nor the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service an agency he oversees and that is primarily responsible for safeguarding the nations imperiled species issued a statement about the report. Rep. Betty McCollum D Minn. the subcommittees chair quoted from the U.N. report and told Bernhardt the country is depending on you to help lead the fight along with us to combat these issues including the biodiversity and climate crises. She asked Bernhardt how he would incorporate the scientific findings into the agencys activities and asked if he would rethink the administrations push to boost domestic energy production. Are we going to stop oil and gas development because of this report? The answer to that is no Bernhardt said. Congress you all have the ability to decide whether we do anything on federal lands. ... If you have a view on what you want to happen well carry it out when you execute it. That is my position. Bernhardt a former oil and gas lobbyist who was confirmed as agency secretary last month told the subcommittee that he recognizes that the climate is changing that human beings are a contributing factor and that the agency is taking the threat into account in its decision making. A pair of dire reports released last year one from the United Nations and another from more than a dozen federal U.S. agencies warned that world governments are running out of time to stave off catastrophic climate change. Still the Trump administration has barreled ahead with its fossil fuel centric energy dominance agenda.Approximately one quarter of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions come from fossil fuel extraction on federal lands according to agovernment report released by the Trump administration in November. Bernhardt who brought with him to the job a slew of potential conflicts of interest from his days as an energy lobbyist also faced tough questions Tuesday about alleged ethics violations. Interiors internal watchdog recently opened two ethics probes the first of them just four days into Bernhardts tenure intomultiple high ranking interior officials including the secretary. Bernhardt stressed as he has before that he takes ethics extremely seriously is working to improve the agencys ethics program and is confident that he has complied with all rules and will be cleared at the end of the investigation.

The Trump administration is challenging California over the state's new automotive emissions and fuel economy framework agreement with automakers insisting setting such standards is the federal government's role. Lawyers at the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Transportation on Friday sent a letter to the chairman of the California Air Resources Board following California's July framework agreement with Ford Volkswagen Honda and BMW to abide by certain new greenhouse gas emissions standards. The purpose of this letter is to put California on notice that this framework agreement appears to be inconsistent with federal law the letter said. Congress has squarely vested the authority to set fuel economy standards for new motor vehicles and nationwide standards for GHG vehicle emissions with the federal government not with California or any other state. Given the importance Congress placed on the authority of DOT and EPA for motor vehicle fuel economy and nationwide vehicle emissions standards under federal law we urge you to act immediately to disassociate CARB from the commitments made by the four automakers the letter added. California had imposed stricter fuel economy and emissions standards long before July and some of the state's laws were enacted before the Clean Air Act. Congress granted a waiver to allow California to enact its own standards and a dozen other states also adopted California's standards. The varied standards mean automakers have had to make extra effort in either making two types of cars or manufacturing them all in accordance with the higher California standards. President Trump has pushed for months to weaken Obama era mileage standards nationwide. Those standards were designed to make cars more fuel efficient and reduce pollution. The administration moves to rescind California's authority are likely to prompt legal battles. When President George W. Bush challenged California's greenhouse gas emissions and mileage setting ability California fought it in the courts. The Obama administration subsequently dropped the Bush effort. The Trump administration has argued that the extra expense to comply with the emissions requirements will raise the price of new cars making them unaffordable and depriving buyers of new safety technology. Many experts including former EPA engineers have challenged the administration's safety assertion. Mr. Trump has long advocated for the auto industry and his administration has emphasized that environmental concerns cannot trump economic considerations. You know for too long there's been this conventional wisdom that you've got to choose between economic growth and environmental protection Energy Secretary Rick Perry said during a July speech on the environment that avoided any mention of climate change. That's a false choice and it's one that you've talked about Mr. President. It's always been this country and this country that leads just like you reminded people last Thursday the greatness of America the innovation of America. And the future of this world will rely greatly upon America and this administration.	True	True	True	True	True
The City of Lights Paris has been illuminated in recent days by cars set alight by thousands of protesting Yellow Vestslargely middle class people who earn their living by driving or who commute to get to work. The cause of their ire is a scheduled 25 cents per gallon increase in gas taxes and about 10 cents on diesel to fight climate change. French President Macron deeply unpopular just reversed course on the new green taxParisians are already paying about 7.06 per gallon for gasoline almost half of that in taxes. If Paris streets burned over a proposed25 cents per gallon climate change tax imagine the global conflagration over a 49 per gallon tax. Thats what a United Nations special climate report calls for in 12 years with a carbon tax of 5500 per tonequal to 49 per gallon of gasoline or diesel. Thats about 100 times todays average state and federal motor fuels tax. By 2100 the U.N. estimates that a carbon tax of 27000 per ton is needed240 per gallonto limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Of course that isnt going to happen. The economic wreckage of such a punitive tax would plunge the global economy into a permanent depressionand thats assuming politicians could enact such huge tax increases over the will of their voters. Keep in mind that the unrest in France was triggered by a looming 25 cent hike which is a little less than 10 more in taxes than French drivers already pay. To meet the 49 per gallon tax hike recommended by the U.N. fuel taxes in France would have to go up 17 fold. The violent protests in France were fueled by intense frustration felt by a middle class that sees itself squeezed. They dont earn enough to be part of the elite unconcerned with fuel taxes but they work hard enough that they dont qualify for the generous welfare benefits handed out to the nations poor and to newly arrived immigrants from Africa and the Middle East. Here in America Republicans in Congress passed a resolution against carbon taxes over the summer while Democrats embraced the concept in their party platform. Some incoming members of the new Democratic majority in the House are calling to create a select committee to map out a Green New Deal that would move the U.S. toward using 100 renewable energy for the electric grid while guaranteeing jobs for everyone. In the meantime opinion polls indicate that 54 of Americans do not believe global warming will cause major problems within their lifetimes. So how do climate activists get their way? Some openly talk of imposing authoritarian governance to override democratic institutions. Former NASA climate researcher James Hansen suggested in 2007 that the democratic process does not work. Other scientists have called the threat of global warming the equivalent of war while calling for the crushing of dissent and the jailing of deniers. Those who see climate change as a dire and urgent threat have some work to do to convince voters in the Western democracies to give up their way of life in exchange for unspecified benefits of a slightly less warm worldand thats assuming China India and over a billion people in Africa can be convinced not to try to pull themselves out of povertysomething that may only be done with greater use of fossil fuels. Thus one well worn tactic employed by those who would presume to tell the rest of us how to live where to live and how to workall of the good of the planet of courseis the alarmist study making copious use of lies of omission and commission. An example of the former can be seen in the new National Climate Assessment. The reports first chapter lists recent natural disasters citing this summers deadly Carr Fire in California as an example. But while the report seeks to link wildfire to climate change it glosses over the real reason fires have grown in intensity and size the 30 years of increased environmental restrictions on logging brush clearance and preventive burns that caused a massive and dangerous fuel buildupa problem that was predicted years ago and has nothing to do with global warming. The sin of commission in the service of scaring middle class voters into doing that theyre supposed to can be seen in an economic modeling study paid for by our federal tax dollars as well as underwritten by two billionaires who would be president Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg. Here were told that the U.S. economy will take a 10 hit by 2100 unless we reduce our carbon emissions. Two problems though the authors assume the worst case and least likely scenario with average temperatures more than 14 degrees Fahrenheit hotter by 2100 and they derive two thirds of their economic losses estimate by claiming a large amount of premature deaths due to the hotter temperatures. The latter claim is highly problematic as death rates in regions far hotter than in the U.S. arent meaningfully different when accounting for the standard of living. Why? People adapt rather easily. This makes for scary headlines in the New York Times or CNN but it is far from sound science or even good economics. The bottom line is this economic freedomthe kind you get with a large middle classleads to prosperity economic growth and technological innovation. And its these three things wealth growth and technology which allows humans to thrive on planet Earth not 240 per gallon fuel taxes imposed by an elite that cares not for the masses.

A climate scientist and a former government expert in the audience for Donald Trumps annual address to Congress said this will probably be the last administration that can forgo talking about climate change in the State of the Union speech. Trump did not mention rising temperatures or extreme weather although he did tout the countrys status as the top producer of oil and gas and boast about how quickly his officials have moved to cut regulations. Lisa Graumlich the dean of the environment college at the University of Washington attended the State of the Union address as a guest of the Washington congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. I have been doing research on climate change since the 1970s and it always seemed very far away in time and space. It was something that was going to happen when peoples grandchildren were alive. And that has changed Graumlich said. I dont think that future presidents will find themselves in this position because people are feeling the effects of climate change. Joel Clement who resigned from the interior department because he said the administration was muzzling scientists and ignoring climate change effects on vulnerable communities now works with the Union of Concerned Scientists. He was invited by the Maine congressman Chellie Pingree. The Trump administrations strategy is to ignore climate change and pretend it doesnt exist and pretend the science doesnt exist even if its coming from its own agencies Clement said. To not say anything about it is just ignorance and its irresponsible. In 10 years Clement said climate change will be central to all policy discussions as one of the top three or four issues in the world Clement said. Several other high profile climate advocates were invited by other Democrats protesting against Trumps doubts of the science and his rollbacks. The New York congressman Paul Tonko invited the League of Conservation Voters Gene Karpinski and the Maryland congressman Jamie Raskin brought along 350.orgs Bill McKibben. The Massachusetts senator Ed Markey attended with the head of the youth led Sunrise Movement Varshini Prakash who is calling for a Green New Deal to tackle inequality and quickly cut greenhouse gas emissions. Markey is expected to join Alexandria Ocasio Cortez this week in releasing expanded language on the high level goals of a Green New Deal. Even the Democratic rebuttal to Trumps speech by the ex Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams only mentioned climate change once in a list of priorities the US could pursue. However Bernie Sanders in his own response speech noted warnings in reports from the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. How can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention not one word about climate change when the leading scientists of the world tell us that climate change is real that climate change is caused by human activity that climate change is already causing devastating harm in the United States Sanders said. Furthermore the scientists tell us we have a very short 12 years not a lot of time in order to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels. While very little of the primetime speeches focused on climate change Democrats will hold two hearings in the House on Wednesday about its effects.	False	False	False	True	False
Washington CNN President Donald Trump spent an hour Thursday talking about his commitment to economic growth and national stability as he announced the decision to back out of the Paris Climate Accord. After famously calling climate change a hoax during the campaign Trump has avoided the issue of increased man made greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on global temperatures. Asked Wednesday if Trump thinks human activity is contributing to climate change White House press secretary Sean Spicer responded Honestly I haven't asked him that. I can get back to you. Two White House officials avoided similar questions at a background briefing with reporters after Trump's speech Thursday. And EPA chief Scott Pruitt dodged the question in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper. This is not about whether climate change is occurring or not Pruitt said on The Lead. The pattern of the White House has been to turn away from the discussion of climate change without taking the step to argue directly that global warming isn't real. Instead there is an administration wide reluctance to avoid the topic altogether. In recent months Trump proposed cutting the Environmental Protection Agency budget by more than 30. EPA has challenged scientific findings on climate change including by its own in house scientists. And EPA cut climate information from its website. Former deputy EPA administrator under President Barack Obama Bob Perciasepe said the Trump administration's avoidance of the term just makes them seem out of touch with reality. Climate change is happening whether they speak about it or not said Perciasepe who currently serves as president of the nonprofit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. You can't make something not real if you just don't talk about it. It doesn't change reality it's just a way for them to de emphasize something the rest of the world knows is going on. On Wednesday the White House declared June National Oceans Month and Great Outdoors Month. While the proclamations a relatively standard annual designation praised the US's oceans and natural landscapes the language clearly differed from Obama's. Where Obama's 2016 proclamations discussed the impacts of global warming including drought and rising sea levels Trump's focused on energy production fisheries management and tourism with no mention of climate change. And the administration is adopting the same reasoning in press releases. Last month the Interior Department released a study by the U.S. Geological Survey that highlighted the link between sea level rise and global climate change. Except the release had one thing missing any mention of climate change. Three of the study's scientist authors told The Washington Post that they had to ultimately delete a line from the report that read Global climate change drives sea level rise increasing the frequency of coastal flooding. Instead the USGS release leaves the cause unmentioned . It begins The frequency and severity of coastal flooding throughout the world will increase rapidly and eventually double in frequency over the coming decades even with only moderate amounts of sea level rise. A defense against believing humans are responsible for climate change is that scientific studies are not 100 certain a stance frequently used by members of the Trump administration that muddles the scientific consensus that man made emissions are driving global warming. I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact Pruitt said in a CNBC interview in March . So no I would not agree that it's a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. While the White House may be against jumping to conclusions on the available scientific studies with Pruitt even calling for more data from industry scientists the administration has done little to back up those calls monetarily. In fact instead of spending money to further study the effects and reality or unreality of global warming the administration has opted instead to cut much of the major funding that would go towards the studies. It is hypocritical said Andrew Rosenberg director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. They are complaining about uncertainty but at the same time increasing uncertainty by cutting back on ways to measure climate change. For many the administration's reluctance to deal with the idea of climate change comes down to one thought that economic growth and climate awareness cannot go hand in hand. The idea that they are operating on is that the US will be at a disadvantage if it deals with climate change. Most businesses would think that working on the climate issues can and has been creating jobs said Perciasepe. It can strengthen United States company's competitiveness in the global markets.

Forget the Golden State. California should be called the Smoggy State. Eight of the USA's 10most polluted cities in terms of ozone pollution are in California according to the American Lung Association's annual State of the Air report released Wednesday. The Los AngelesLong Beach area took the dubious distinction of being the nation's most ozone polluted cityas it has for nearly the entire 19 year history of the report. Overall the report said about133 million Americans more than four of 10 live with unhealthful levels of air pollution placing them at risk for premature death and other serious health effects such as lung cancer asthma attacks cardiovascular damage and developmental and reproductive harm. We still have a lot to do in this country to clean up air pollution said Lyndsay Moseley Alexander director of the Association's Healthy Air Campaign. The report looked at pollution levels from 2014 to 2016. Ozone pollution was worse overall in this report than it was in last year's report. Bakersfield Calif. wasin second place for ozone pollution. Other California cities on the list include Fresno Sacramento and San Diego. The only non California metro areas in the top 10 list were Phoenix and New York City. Of the 10 most polluted cities seven cities did worse in this year's report including Los Angeles and the New York City metro area. More President Trump directs EPA to ease air quality rules he says suffocates industry Near record setting heat from our changing climate has resulted in dangerous levels of ozone in many cities across the country making ozone an urgent health threat for millions of Americans Lung Association President and CEO Harold P. Wimmersaid. Smog forms on warm sunny days and is made worse fromchemicals that exit vehicle tailpipes and from power plant and industrial smokestacks.Warmer temperatures make ozone more likely to form.

SinceCalifornia is known for its strict environmental regulations why are so many cities from the state typically on this list?It's because the state would be far worse off without its strict laws on tailpipe pollution and eliminating coal fired power plants. California has done more than any other state to counteract air pollution the Lung Association said. With this report the Lung Association also calls out Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency EPA for ongoing threats to the nations air quality including steps to roll back or weaken enforcement of the Clean Air Act. EPA administrator Scott Pruitt hastaken many steps to roll back or put in loopholes to the Clean Air Act Alexander said adding thattheassociation is concerned and we will continueto fight forhealthy air she said. Some good news in the report was that particulate pollution generally continued to improve in 2014 16 the report said. This was true for both short term particulate pollution and for year round particulate pollution. For year round particle pollution Fairbanks Alaska was the most polluted city. TheLung Association also lists the nation's cleanest cities meaning ones that experience no high ozone or high particulate pollution days. The nation's cleanest cities are Bellingham Wash.

Humans are sleepwalking into a mass extinction of species not seen since the demise of the dinosaurs British scientists warned. Man made global change is threatening the diversity of different creatures that have taken millennia to evolve to live in niche habitats. Creatures that have moved into delicate ecosystems such as coral reefs often live in symbiosis with others and are the slowest to recover their diversity if damaged. But global warming and rising sea levels threatened to wipe out many species that cannot adapt to change quickly enough in a blink of an eye. In particular freshwater habitats are teeming with diverse birds and mammals but they are often form isolated pockets which are vulnerable to sudden change. Professor of Evolutionary Paleobiology Matthew Wills at the Milner Centre for Evolution at the University of Bath said We are sleepwalking into a mass extinction of a magnitude unparalleled since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. Astonishingly we know remarkably little about the physical and biological forces that shape patterns of diversity on a global scale. For example why are there over a million species of insects but only 32 species in their immediate sister group the little known remipedes? Diversity takes millions of years to evolve but can be damaged in the blink of an eye. We are already losing diversity that has never even been documented so it's vitally important to understand the mechanisms that drive evolution into new species. The scientists looked at how the humble caridean shrimp has evolved and diversified since it first appeared in the Lower Jurassic. There are now around 3500 species worldwide living in salt and fresh water habitats and are a vital component of the marine food chain and an important contribution to fisheries worldwide. Research Fellow Dr Katie Davis an evolutionary palaeobiologist at the University of York explained Understanding the processes that shaped the strikingly irregular distribution of species richness across the Tree of Life is a major research agenda. Changes in ecology may go some way to explain the often strongly asymmetrical fates of sister clades and we test this in the caridean shrimps. There are depending upon estimates between two and 50 million extant species of animals Metazoa all derived from a single common ancestral species that lived some 650 million years ago. Net rates of speciation therefore exceed rates of extinction but the balance of these processes varies greatly both between clades and throughout geological time. The scientists examined the patterns of diversity change across the crustaceans's evolutionary tree. By time calibrating the largest ever evolutionary tree for carideans against both fossil and molecular dates it was possible to explore where rates of diversification sped up and slowed down over the last 200 million years. They found the shrimp have independently transitioned from marine to freshwater habitats repeatedly creating much richer pockets of biodiversity. The relative isolation of lakes and rivers appear to increase the diversity of species in a similar way to Darwin's finches on island chains. But rising sea levels caused by climate change could put these pockets at risk disrupting these freshwater distributions and leading to extinctions as a result. By contrast many marine shrimp live in close symbiotic associations with a variety of other animals including corals and sponges which appears to have slowed their diversification rate. Symbioses are most common in shallow reef settings among the most diverse but notoriously delicately balanced and threatened marine ecosystems. The researchers said lower rates of diversification mean it will take longer for carideans to recover from the extinctions that are already inevitably underway. Co author Sammy de Grave head of research at the Oxford University Museum added The study was published in the journal Communications Biology.	False	False	False	False	False
President Trump on Wednesday signed two executive orders that will make it harder for states to block the construction of oil and gas pipelines and other energy projects due to environmental concerns. Coming on the heels of officials in Washington state and New York using permitting processes to stop new energy projects in recent years and at the urging of some industry leaders Trumps executive order willspeed up the construction of oil and gas pipelines across the country. My action today will cut through the destructive permitting and denials Trump said during the signing of the executive orders at the International Union of Operating Engineers International Training and Education Center a union run facility in Crosby Texas. Under this administration weve ended the war on American energy. It will take no more than 60 days Trump said of the approval process for new pipelines and the president not the bureaucracy will make the final decision. While the move was greeted warmly by members of the countrys oil and gas industries it is likely to rankle some more traditional conservative lawmakers including several Republican governors worried about the federal government impinging on individual state rights and governance. The White House has sought to stave off any discord by arguing that the order is not meant to take power away from the states but to ensure that state actions follow the intent of the Clean Water Act. Trade groups representing the oil and gas industry applauded the orders and said greater access to natural gas benefits families and the environment. When states say 'no' to the development of natural gas pipelines they force utilities to curb safe and affordable service and refuse access to new customers including new businesses said Karen Harbert president and CEO at the American Gas Association. Trump's move comes less than a week after nearly a dozen business groups told EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler that the environmental review and permitting process for energy infrastructure projects has become a target for environmental activists and states that oppose the production and use of fossil fuels. The groups said in an April 5 letter that individual states shouldn't be able to use provisions of the Clear Air Act to dictate national policy thereby harming other states and the national interest and damaging cooperative federalism. Washington state blocked the building of a coal terminal in 2017 saying there were too many major harmful impacts including air pollution rail safety and vehicle traffic. New York regulators stopped a natural gas pipeline saying it failed to meet standards to protect streams wetlands and other water resources. Under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act companies must get certification from the state before moving ahead with an energy project. One of Trump's planned executive orders calls for the Environmental Protection Agency to consult with states tribes and others before issuing new guidance and rules for states on how to comply with the law. Environmental groups described Trump's order as an effort to short circuit a state's ability to review complicated projects putting at risk a state's ability to protect drinking water supplies and wildlife. The Trump Administration's proposal would trample on state authority to protect waters within their own borders said Jim Murphy senior counsel for the National Wildlife Federation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The private Center for Biological Diversity said Wednesday's actions would mark the fourth time Trump has used executive orders to streamline permits for fossil fuel infrastructure. Trump's developing an addiction to executive orders that rubberstamp these climate killing projects said Brett Hartl government affairs director at the center. The second executive order Trump signed on Wednesday streamlines the process for energy infrastructure that crosses international borders. Currently the secretary of state has the authority to issue permits for cross border infrastructure such as pipelines. The executive order clarifies that the president will make the decision on whether to issue such permits. The move follows Trump's decision last month to issue a new presidential permit for the long stalled Keystone XL oil pipeline two years after he first approved it and more than a decade after it was first proposed.

CNN Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed the state's first chief science officer on Monday marking what he called the state's commitment to science based solutions. DeSantis appointed Thomas Frazer a biologist who has been director of the University of Florida's School of Natural Resources and Environment since 2012 and previously worked as acting director of the UF Water Institute In the new position he will coordinate Florida's research data and scientific work and make sure officials have the scientific analysis they need to tackle the state's environmental problems. Frazer's research has looked at pollution's effects on water. He's also worked on research involving climate change. He's been on the faculty advisory committee with the UF Climate Institute and served as chairman of the Climate Science Faculty Committee. Climate change will be a part of his office's mission. We have to look at the facts of what is going on in the environment and can we bring science to bear on those changes happening now and in the future? Frazer said. Asked whether he thought climate change was a threat to Florida DeSantis said the issue was politicized but noted that he considers sea level rise a serious threat. My environmental policy is just to do things that benefit Floridians. And the idea that you're signing up for some type of agenda I don't want to ... send a signal that that's what I'm doing because I'm not doing that DeSantis said . This is what we're going to do. We're going to do what works. DeSantis said the appointment keeps with his promise to make sound science a Florida priority. As one of Florida's leading environmental researchers Dr. Frazer understands the unique water issues facing our state and the actions we must take to solve them he said Monday. Since day one my administration has been laser focused on addressing our pressing environmental challenges. On January 10 DeSantis signed an Executive Order that pledged to secure 2.5 billion over the next four years to restore the Everglades. It created the Blue Green Algae Task Force and promised to work with local communities to invest in green infrastructure. It also created the chief science officer position. Frazer will have his work cut out for him. In July Scott declared a state of emergency for several counties to help local governments deal with an unprecedented toxic algal bloom that killed thousands of marine animals including dolphins and manatees. The bloom which affected more than 100 miles of Florida shoreline also sent people to the doctor with respiratory problems and eye issues. below sea level by 2100 Sea level rise alone is projected to outpace the global average for Southeast Florida. The region could see nearly a foot more of water in the short term. There's also a chance that more than 346 billion in property value will bebelow sea level by 2100 studies show Frazer said he's honored by the appointment. Our environment and waterways make Florida unique he said. I look forward to working with the governor and the Department of Environmental Protection on ways we can use sound science and research to improve our state's water quality and protect the environment.

More than 380 people have been confirmed dead after a tsunami triggered by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit an Indonesian city on Friday. Waves up to 3m 10ft high swept through Palu on Sulawesi island. Video on social media shows people screaming and fleeing in panic and a mosque among the buildings damaged. Strong aftershocks rocked the city on Saturday. Thousands of homes have collapsed along with hospitals hotels and a shopping centre. Rescue efforts are under way though hampered by a major power cut. The main road to Palu has been blocked due to a landslide and a key bridge is out of action. Indonesia's disaster agency said at least 384 people had been killed but the number is expected to rise. At least 540 have been injured and 29 are listed as missing. Many bodies were found along the shoreline because of the tsunami but the numbers are still unknown Sutopo Purwo Nugroho a spokesman for the agency told Reuters. When the threat arose yesterday people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims he told a news briefing. The tsunami didn't come by itself it dragged cars logs houses it hit everything on land. Some survived by climbing 6m 18ft trees to escape the huge waves the spokesman said. A less powerful quake earlier on Friday had killed at least one person and injured at least 10 in the smaller fishing town of Donggala. In Palu hundreds of people had been preparing for a beach festival that was due to start on Friday night. The city's main hospital was damaged in the quake and TV footage showed dozens of injured people being treated outside in makeshift medical tents. Palu and Donggala are home to more than 600000 people. President Joko Widodo said troops were en route to the area to reinforce rescue teams and help retrieve bodies. The main airport in Palu has been closed since the tsunami hit. A minister said the runway had been damaged but that it was hoped helicopters would still be able to land. The country's military is sending cargo planes of relief aid from the capital Jakarta. Officials are urging locals not to enter their homes and to sleep away from buildings due to the risk of aftershocks. The earthquake hit just off central Sulawesi at a depth of 10km 6.2 miles just before 1800 on Friday 1000 GMT the US Geological Survey said. A tsunami warning was issued but lifted within the hour. Indonesia's meteorological agency has been criticised for its response but officials said the waves struck while the warning was in place. Dramatic video of the tsunami hitting Palu shows the high waves sweeping away several buildings and then the large tilted mosque in the town about 80km from the quake's epicentre. The situation is chaotic people are running on the streets and buildings collapsed. There is a ship washed ashore said Dwikorita Karnawati head of Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency. A 2004 tsunami triggered by an earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra killed 226000 across the Indian Ocean including more than 120000 in Indonesia. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the Ring of Fire the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim. More than half of the world's active volcanoes above sea level are part of the ring. Just last month a series of deadly earthquakes struck the Indonesian island of Lombok. The biggest on 5 August killed more than 460 people. Have you been affected by the earthquake?

In the first significant check on the Trump administrations energy first agenda a US judge has temporarily halted hundreds of drilling projects for failing to take climate change into account. Drilling had been stalled on more than 300000 acres of public land in Wyoming after it was ruled the Trump administration violated environmental laws by failing to consider greenhouse gas emissions. The federal judge has ordered the Bureau of Land Management BLM which manages US public lands and issues leases to the energy industry to redo its analysis. The decision stems from an environmental lawsuit. WildEarth Guardians Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Western Environmental Law Center sued the BLM in 2016 for failing to calculate and limit the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from future oil and gas projects. The agency did not adequately quantify the climate change impacts of oil and gas leasing said Rudolph Contreras a US district judge in Washington DC in a ruling late on Tuesday. He added that the agency must consider the cumulative impact of GHG greenhouse gas emissions generated by past present and future BLM leases across the country. The decision is the first significant check on the climate impact of the Trump administrations energy first agenda that has opened up vast swaths of public land for mining and drilling. Environmental advocates are praising the move with Jeremy Nichols WildEarth Guardians Climate and Energy Program director calling it a triumph for our climate. This ruling says that the entire oil gas drilling program is off the rails and moving forward illegally said Nichols. Under Trump the pace of leasing public lands for oil and gas development has surged. A recent study found the administration has made more than 13m onshore acres available for leasing far more than any similar period under Obama. The vast majority are located in the western states of Colorado Montana New Mexico Nevada Utah and Wyoming. The administration also plans to make large portions of the Atlantic available for oil and gas development and the interior department has been criticized for favoring the energy industry. The BLM did not reply to a request for comment. The Western Energy Alliance one of the defendants in the case also did not respond to a request. Kathleen Sgamma its president told the Washington Post This judge has ignored decades of legal precedent in this ruling. The judge is basically asking BLM to take a wild guess on how many wells will be developed on leases prematurely. Nichols predicts there will be implications for public lands across the west. His group is now poised to bring litigation to block drilling on hundreds of thousands of acres in other states. With the science mounting that we need to aggressively rein in greenhouse gases this ruling is monumental said Kyle Tisdel attorney and energy and communities program director for the Western Environmental Law Center. Every acre of our public land sold to the oil and gas industry is another blow to the climate making this ruling a powerful reality check on the Trump administration and a potent tool for reining in climate pollution.

Deforestation of Brazil's Amazon rainforest increased by 29.5 in 12 months the highest rate since 2008 the country's space agency reports. The rainforest lost 9762 sq km 3769 sq miles of its vegetation between August 2018 and July 2019 Inpe says. Far right President Jair Bolsonaro has in the past questioned the accuracy of data provided by Inpe. Scientists say the Amazon has suffered losses at an accelerated rate since Mr Bolsonaro took office in January. They say the president favours development over conservation. Who is Brazil's new leader Jair Bolsonaro? Mr Bolsonaro who in July dismissed a similar Inpe report as flawed has not commented on the latest data. As the largest rainforest in the world the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. Over the past decade previous governments in Brazil had managed to reduce deforestation with concerted action by federal agencies and a system of fines. But Mr Bolsonaro and his ministers have criticised the penalties and overseen a dramatic fall in confiscations of timber and convictions for environmental crimes.	False	False	False	False	False
Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke let the mask slip this week turning the subtext of his term in office backing fossil fuels into the headline as he spoke to a friendly audience. On Tuesday Zinke gave the keynote address at the Louisiana Oil and Gas Associations fall meeting in Lafayette Louisiana. He told the conference over lunch our government should work for you according to organizers You can debate what Zinke meant by work for you but many heard it as a pledge of allegiance to the industry. And according to the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association the industry members in the room were thrilled with the pledge giving Zinke a standing ovation. An organizer told me none of the speeches at the event were recorded. However environmental activists and some lawmakers were appalled by the statement. And then that evening Zinkes official Twitter account went into damage control mode implying the message was meant for a broader audience rather than just the industries hes supposed to regulate. But Zinke has said pretty much the same thing before. In March he told an energy industry conference Interior should not be in the business of being an adversary. We should be in the business of being a partner. For the record the Interior Departments job is to manage about 75 percent of federal public land which amounts to about one fifth of the total area of the United States. This means conservation preserving culture and facilitating recreation. It also entails leasing rights to mining drilling grazing and logging. However it does not mean that the agency needs to advance the fossil fuel industrys interests certainly not at the expense of the environment. But the Interior Department under Zinke has been pushing much harder to open up public lands to private companies while drastically rolling back its environmental responsibilities. Our mandate is multiple use of public lands and multiple use also includes the development of natural resources as we seek to leverage American energy for American strength Zinke wrote in the departments 2018 22 strategic plan. One place weve seen Zinke pick sides is in his response to Californias record wildfires. Rather than acknowledging the role of climate change in increasing fire risks he blamed environmental terrorist groups while calling for more private logging on public lands. Zinkes words have been loud but his actions have been even louder. Under Zinke weve seen the largest rollback of federal land protections in US history. He also opened nearly all US coastal waters to offshore oil and gas drilling preparing for the largest lease sale in US history. The National Park Service which is part of the Interior Department proposed more than doubling national park entrance fees before settling on increases of 5 to 10. The Bureau of Land Management also part of the Interior Department announced this week it was revising its rules on methane emissions from gas drilling on public lands. Interior is also pushing for more roads in wilderness areas dialing back conservation plans for wildlife and selling leases for Arctic oil and gas drilling. The agency canceled a study looking into the health impacts of coal mining and dismissed violations committed by coal companies. Taken together its pretty clear who Zinke is working for. However the Trump administration has the odd habit of stumbling over itself. President Donald Trumps trade war is already threatening to undo gains for the fossil fuel industry as China readies tariffs on US energy. Zinke himself tendencies exhibited by former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt that have invited scrutiny from lawmakers. Hes opaque with his schedule obscuring his dealings with the energy industry. He took a 12000 flight on an oil executives charter plane. He was involved in a land deal with the chair of Halliburton which may have violated conflict of interest rules. The Government Accountability Office had to end a probe in June into whether Zinke threatened Sen. Lisa Murkowski R AK over her vote on Obamacare because the Interior Department didnt cooperate. He also has his office fly a secretarial flag when hes in the building and minted his own challenge coin. With Pruitt no longer sucking the oxygen out of the room congressional Democrats are now eyeing Zinke and have promised more investigations of his conduct should they take control of the House in the fall. Zinke is one the most ethically challenged members of the Cabinet and maybe one of the most ethically challenged secretaries of the Interior weve had in living memory Rep. Gerry Connolly D VA who could chair the House Oversight Government Operations Subcommittee if Democrats win in November told Politico this week. Theres rich material here to look into his behavior and his fitness for continued service in the office.	False	False	False	False	False
ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Bernie Sanders I Vt. is hosting a livestreamedsummit on climate change next month intensifying pressure on the new Congress and TV networks to devote attention to the crisis. We need millions of people all over this country to stand up and demand fundamental changes in our energy policy in order to protect our kids and our grandchildren and the planet Sanders told HuffPost by phone. The good news is the American people are beginning to stand up and fight back. The event bolsters Sandersa likely contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination as the most serious candidate on climate change offering a far more comprehensive response than rival progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren D Mass. who staked out a climate policy based on a bill to force public companies to disclose financial risk from warming or regulations to curb emissions. The summit which took months to plan will take place less than a month after Rep. elect Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D N.Y. propelled talk of a so called Green New Deal into the Democratic mainstream giving play for the first time to the sort of federal response to climate change scientists say is necessary to fully meet the scale of the crisis. In October the United Nations concluded world governments must halve emissions over the next 12 years or risk catastrophic warming with 54 trillion in damage. What we are seeing is a growing consciousness Sanders said. The horrors that weve seen in California in the largest forest fire that that state has ever experienced this is not going to be an anomaly unless we begin the long hard struggle to transform our energy system. Climate remains a low priority for most voters. Just 38 percent of registered voters said candidates positions on global warming would be very important to their voting decisions according to a Yale Program On Climate Change Communication survey published in May. Rising temperatures ranked 15th of 28 issues voters ranked in the questionnaire. In the lead up to the 2018 midterm elections the fossil fuel industry spent 100 million to crush pro climate ballot measures across the West and to prop up candidates who supported increased oil and gas extraction. Yet that base of climate hawks helped elect a cadre of Democrats whose urgent visions for climate action earned plaudits from a spectrum ranging from mainstream environmental groups to so called eco socialists. And a new majority of Democratic stateattorneys general are facing growing pressure to file lawsuits over climate damages. Activists freshly galvanized by the hellscape images of Californias deadliest wildfire seem primed for action and the partys progressive wing has signaled a new willingness to force a more serious debate over an issue thats remained stagnant in the House for much of the past decade. The fact that climate change is that high among the base of one of our two major political parties is remarkable because that was not the case even five years ago said Anthony Leiserowitz a senior research scientist and Yales climate program director. If you think of Bernie youd think hed be talking about inequality or civil rights. Theres a whole host of progressive issues yet this is the one hes leading with. It may suggest theres been an alignment of the stars. Last week youth activists with the grassroots climate group Sunrise Movement staged sit ins in the offices of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi D Calif. and Rep. Frank Pallone D N.J. the likely next chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee who opposed the creation of a select committee on a Green New Deal. The horrors that weve seen in California in the largest forest fire that that state has ever experienced this is not going to be an anomaly unless we being the long hard struggle to transform our energy system. He helped popularize things like Medicare for All a living wage and a lot of other fights hes taken up said Varshini Prakash the co founder of Sunrise Movement. I hope he pushes for a Green New Deal and helps really add fuel to the fire thats been lit under politicians and the public over the past week. Sanders stopped short of endorsing the Green New Deal. But in April 2017 he co sponsored legislation to move the United States to 100 percent clean energy by 2050. The bill included 7 billion in targeted infrastructure and environmental investments in fossil fuel communities and called for union labor protections for workers on federally backed green jobs. In November 2017 Sanders introduced a bill to spend 146 billion rebuilding storm ravaged Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with renewable energy. Seventy one percent of major televised debates in the 2018 midterm elections ignored the issue completely. Only four of the 107 segments ABC CBS and NBC aired from Nov. 8 to Nov. 13 on the deadly wildfires scorching California this month discussed climate change. In 2017 the influential Sunday morning talk shows on ABC CBS NBC and Fox News aired a combined 260 minutes of climate coverage 79 percent of which focused exclusively on President Donald Trumps personal beliefs on science and his decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement.

Just a few hours before the second round of 2020 Democratic presidential contenders are set to face off dozens of local activists in Miami Florida held an Underwater Climate Rally calling for more discussion about climate change at the second Democratic debate. A coalition of local environmental groups organized the march to the Arsht Center in Miami where this round of debates is being held with marchers sporting signs calling for a specific climate change debate and pushing for the Green New Deal. Melissa Baldwin co organizer of Miami Climate Month which organized the rally says from the moment she and her fellow organizers found out the first debate would be in Miami they wanted to put a spotlight on climate change because you cant come to Miami without talking about climate change. Climate change and fossil fuels have already disturbed the daily lives of Floridians. Sea level rise and warming temperatures threaten cities like Miami. Kim Ross ReThink Energy Florida leader resident witnessed people in her communityinTallahasseefeeling helpless after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster which damaged Gulf Coast ecosystems. This isnt something in the future Ross says. This is something thats happening now and needs to be addressed now. At the first 2020 Democratic debate on Wednesday night Democrats spent less than 10 minutes talking about climate change. Though not an extensive conversation that was still more time spent talkingabout climate change than in all of threedebates combined between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in 2016. Baldwin tells Mother Jones that climate and energy policy needs a prolonged conversation at every debate because climate change is an issue that affects every other issue agriculture the economy including tourism.

The United States submitted a formal notification that it will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Monday a move that has been widely expected since President Trump announced his intention to do so in 2017. The climate agreement which went into force Nov. 4 2016 committed countries that signed the measure to take certain voluntary steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement was not legally enforceable and countries set their own emissions targets. The accord banned countries from announcing their intent to withdraw in its first three years meaning Monday was the first day the U.S. was allowed to submit its intent to leave the agreement since it went into force in 2016. President Trump made the decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement because of the unfair economic burden imposed on American workers businesses and taxpayers by U.S. pledges made under the Agreement Pompeo said in a statement. The United States has reduced all types of emissions even as we grow our economy and ensure our citizens access to affordable energy. LEONARDO DICAPRIO PRAISES GRETA THUNBERG AS 'A LEADER OF OUR TIME' Trump has previously said that the Paris climate agreement harms the U.S. economy and would hurt American jobs if left to stand. Compliance with the terms of the Paris accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates Trump said in the Rose Garden in 2017 when he announced plans to remove the U.S. from the accord. This includes 440000 fewer manufacturing jobs not what we need believe me this is not what we need including automobile jobs and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely. They rely for so much and we would be giving them so little. Some opponents of the agreement have noted that countries such as Russia and China were not affected as significantly by the accord as the United States and pointed out the unencouraging results of the Kyoto Protocol raising questions about whether the Paris agreement would reduce global greenhouse gas emissions at all. GRETA THUNBERG TURNS DOWN ENVIRONMENTAL PRIZE SAYS 'CLIMATE MOVEMENT DOES NOT NEED ANY MORE AWARDS' Half of the countries that were legally bound to the Kyoto Protocol treaty failed to adhere to their pledges and the host country of Japan even increased their carbon emissions Sen. Jim Inhofe R Okla. said as the Paris climate agreement was being debated in 2016. Now we find ourselves celebrating an agreement where the worlds largest carbon emitter China is permitted to increase their emissions until 2025 and to continue bringing a coal fired power plant online every 10 days. We even turn a blind eye to the fact that China lied about its carbon emissions when it first came to the table with its pledge last year. Others however see America backing out of the international pact to limit greenhouse gas emissions as an abdication of global leadership and denial of basic climate science. By withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement to double down on a coal fossil fuel energy agenda Trump has engaged in a unilateral disarmament in the economic arms race that is the transition to clean energy said Michael Mann a climate scientist and professor at Penn State University. The challenge of averting dangerous and irreversible climate change and massive coastal inundation devastating floods and droughts is that much more an uphill climb with Trump's pullout from the Paris agreement. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In his statement Monday however Pompeo maintained that the United States was on the right track both economically and environmentally. Our results speak for themselves he wrote. U.S. emissions of criteria air pollutants that impact human health and the environment declined by 74 percent between 1970 and 2018. U.S. net greenhouse gas emissions dropped 13 percent from 2005 2017 even as our economy grew over 19 percent.	False	False	False	False	False
Last month during an episode of CNBCs Squawk Box Scott Pruitt the head of the Environmental Protection Agency said that he did not consider carbon emissions to be a primary contributor to global warming. Pruitt was pretty steadfast in his position then however on Sunday he was forced to entertain the possibility that he might be wrong during an interview with Fox Newss Chris Wallace. After referencing Pruitts statement from last month Wallace said that there are all kinds of studies that contradict him. The Fox News Sunday anchor went on to reference a report from the U.N. that says it is 95 percent likely that human activity has caused the majority of the warming that has taken place since the mid 20th century. The report also determines thatthere is more carbon dioxide now than in the last 400000 years and that2015 and 2016 were the two hottest years on record. After listing this information Wallace then asked Mr. Pruitt are we supposed to believe thats all a coincidence? Unable to give a straight answer Pruitt first admitted that human activity does contribute to the current warming trend. He then quickly moved on to accusing President Obama of reimagining authority with his clean power plan and praised Trumps recent executive order undoing environmental regulations that Obama put in place. Wallace quickly called Pruitt out on his inability to answer the question saying Sir youre sugar coating what you have said. You said there that you would not agree that carbon CO2 is a primary contributor to global warming. And the question I have is what if youre wrong? What if in fact the Earth is warming what if it is causing dramatic climate change and that we as humans through carbon emissions are contributing to it? Backed into a corner Pruitt conceded that CO2 does contribute to global warming although he followed up this concession by saying The issue is how much we contribute to it from a human activity perspective and what can be done about it from a process perspective. Wallace responded by asking But dont you think the fact that we have these coal power plants belching carbon emissions into the air you dont think that plays a role? Realizing that he wasnt going to get anywhere with Pruitt on that particular issue Wallace switched gears slightly to ask a final question about the Trump administrations proposed cuts to the EPA. Once again Pruitt took the question as an opportunity to criticize the Obama administration saying that in the past there has been a lack of commitment to state partnership. When Wallace asked him if he was sure that the states would pick up the slack Pruitt said that he had met with several governors who had confirmed that they would. Whether or not thats actually true remains to be seen. Watch the interview below via YouTube. Featured image is a screenshot from the video.	False	False	False	False	False
WASHINGTON AP Democrats including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York are calling for a Green New Deal intended to transform the U.S. economy to combat climate change and create thousands of jobs in renewable energy. The freshman lawmaker and veteran Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts are teaming up on the plan which aims to eliminate the U.S. carbon footprint by 2030. A joint resolution drafted by Ocasio Cortez and Markey sets a goal to meet 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean renewable and zero emission energy sources including dramatic increases in wind and solar power. A news conference at the Capitol is set for Thursday the day they introduce the resolution. While setting lofty goals the plan does not explicitly call for eliminating the use of fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas a nod to pragmatism that may disappoint some of Ocasio Cortezs strongest supporters. Even so their Green New Deal goes far beyond the Clean Power Plan proposed by President Barack Obama. President Donald Trump has scrapped Obamas plan which imposed emissions limits on coal fired power plants as a job killer. The Democrats are likely to meet resistance to their proposal in Congress especially in the Republican controlled Senate. Trump who has expressed doubts about climate change also is likely to oppose it. The resolution marks the first time Ocasio Cortez and other lawmakers have attached legislative language onto the Green New Deal a concept that until now has been largely undefined other than as a call for urgent action to head off catastrophic climate change and create jobs. Several Democratic presidential hopefuls have embraced the idea of a Green New Deal without saying exactly what it means. Ocasio Cortez said in a statement that the plan will create unprecedented levels of prosperity and wealth for all while ensuring economic and environmental justice and security. She calls for a World War II scale mobilization that includes high quality education and health care clean air and water and safe affordable housing. Answering critics who call the plan unrealistic Ocasio Cortez says that when President John F. Kennedy wanted to go to the moon by the end of the 1960s people said it was impossible. She also cites Franklin D. Roosevelts New Deal Lyndon B. Johnsons Great Society and the interstate highway system begun under Dwight D. Eisenhower as examples of American know how and capability. While focusing on renewable energy Ocasio Cortez said the plan would include existing nuclear power plants but block new nuclear plants. Nuclear power does not emit greenhouse gases which contribute to global warming. The resolution does not include a price tag but some Republicans predict it would cost in the trillions of dollars. They denounced the plan at House hearings on climate change on Wednesday. The Green New Deal would be paid for the same way we paid for the original New Deal World War II the bank bailouts tax cuts for the rich and decades of war with public money appropriated by Congress Ocasio Cortez said. Government can take an equity stake in Green New Deal projects so the public gets a return on its investment she said.	False	False	False	False	False
I actually did feel there was a real chance that he might come to his senses and stay in the Paris Agreement said Gore who has spent years in pursuit of action on climate change and on Tuesday joined CNN for a town hall moderated by Anderson Cooper. Gore met with Trump after the 2016 election at the invitation of Ivanka Trump and he spoke again with the President by phone in early May. But Gore's and Ivanka's influence clearly was not enough. After some delay Trump announced in the Rose Garden in June that he intended to pull the United States out of the climate agreement. Gore declined to get into the details of his private conversations with Trump but said those conversations had left him with reason to believe Trump would keep the United States in the agreement but added that thankfully his worst fears about the withdrawal were not realized. I was worried that other countries might use it as an excuse to pull out themselves Gore said. But I was gratified when the next day the entire rest of the world doubled down on the commitment to meet the terms of the Paris Agreement and then in this country so many governors and mayors and business leaders said 'We're still in.' Gore said that even with Trump's decision the United States could still manage to meet its own commitments under the Paris Agreement. The town hall featured people across the country who challenged Gore on the issue or asked his thoughts. Mayor James Eskridge of Tangier Island Virginia said his home town needed a sea wall to fight erosion but claimed sea level rise was not affecting them. I'm not a scientist but I'm a keen observer Eskridge said. And if sea level rise is occurring why am I not seeing signs of it? Earth to warm 2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century studies say Gore said he was aware of the town's situation and said the town was losing ground to rising seas. Tangier Island gained national prominence after Trump called Eskridge in response to a CNN piece on the town. Arguments about science aren't necessarily going to be of any comfort to you Gore said. Won't necessarily do you any good for me to tell you that the scientists do say the sea level is rising in the Chesapeake Bay and that you've lost about two thirds of your island already. Eskridge stood by his claim saying If I see sea level rise occurring I'll shout it from the house top. ... I'm just not seeing it. Gore said it was hard to translate what scientists said into something readily observable and believable. I try every day to figure out ways to do that he said. Gore warned there could be visible signs of a changing climate including stronger hurricanes due to rising ocean temperatures. As the oceans get warmer these ocean based storms get a lot stronger he said. There may not be more hurricanes but the ones that do come are on average likely to be much stronger. However Gore insisted that there is still time to act despite challenges that may lie ahead in adapting to what we can't avoid. We still have the ability to slow it down. We have the ability to prevent even worse sea level rise and and even worse catastrophes that are also caused by the climate crisis Gore said.	False	False	False	False	False
WASHINGTON The Supreme Court refused the Trump administration's request Friday to block21 young people from putting a warming planet on trial in Eugene Ore. Theaction keeps alive at least for nowanunusual lawsuit begun in 2015 to force a change in federal environmental policyby declaring a climate systemcapable of sustaining human life a civil right.The lawsuit was broughton behalf of children now ages 11 22as well as future generations. But while refusing to halt the trial the justices indicated that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit could do so if the Justice Department asks. That court has refused to intervene in the past. Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissented presumably because they were prepared to stop the trial now. The justices had expressedmisgivings about the lawsuitin July when they refused to stop the legal process but said the breadthof theclaims was striking. Whether those claims should be handled in court presents substantial grounds for difference of opinion the court said then. Lawyers for Our Children's Trust have argued that government policies have deprived the children of their constitutional rights to life liberty and propertyto dignity to personal security to a stable climate system capable of sustaining human lives and liberties. They want the government toprepare an accounting of the nations greenhouse gas emissions and prepare and implement an enforceable national remedial plan for reducing carbon emissions. Federal district court Judge Ann Aiken who has presided over pretrial briefing for more than two years had scheduled the trial to begin Mondayand last up to 12 weeks. Courts have an obligation not to overstep the bounds of their jurisdiction but they have an equally important duty to fulfill their role as a check on any unconstitutional actions of the other branches of government she said last monthin denying the government's effort to stall or dismiss the trial. The Justice Departmentobjected to the time and expense claiming that the issue was one for Congress not the courts to resolve. Its objections were first raised during the Obama administration. This suit is an attempt to redirect federal environmental and energy policies through the courts rather than through the political process by asserting a new and unsupported fundamental due process right to certain climate conditions Solicitor General Noel Francisco argued in court papers. The children on whose behalf the lawsuit was filed he said can make no credible claim of imminent irreparable harm. Their alleged injuries stem from the cumulative effects of CO2emissions from every source in the world over decades. Although the case Juliana v. United States has yet to reach the trial stage it has been taught in more than two dozen law schools as well as primary and secondary schools lawyers for the children said inspiring students of all ages to see themselves in the parchment of the U.S. Constitution.

Protesters were arrested in Washington after blocking an oil train by erecting a pop up garden of sunflowers and lying down on the train tracks. The group was protesting a proposed oil terminal and all other fossil fuel infrastructure in the state. Two people were arrested Monday during a protest in downtown Vancouver Washington held by the activist group Shut Down Fossil Fuels. Protesters locked their arms into large sunflower pots and laid down on train tracks calling on Washington Governor Jay Inslee D to reject the proposed Vancouver Tesoro Savage Oil Terminal and all other proposed fossil fuel infrastructure in the State of Washington the group said in a press release. The protesters were blocking a BNSF train carrying Bakken Crude Oil a highly volatile oil that caused a train to explode in Mosier Oregon last June. Jessie Braverman the groups media liaison told RT that around 25 people showed up at the train tracks to address climate change and let the governor know that if he isnt going to stop the terminal than we will. Our community and our planet are under attack yet the political response has been amoral and inadequate. We were here on the tracks a year after the Mosier oil train derailment and nothing has changed Braverman said in a statement. The trains are still coming and new fossil fuel projects are still being proposed were in the midst of a worldwide climate emergency and were fighting back. Braverman confirmed that two people were arrested during the protest and they are still being held in jail. She also said that there had been no word from the governor whom they had been attempting to contact throughout the day. According to the Associated Press the tracks were cleared after an hour. In 2014 the state of Washington passed legislation to increase track and hazardous material inspections require oil spill contingency plans increase funding for prevention and cleanup of oil spills and improve safety at crossings along oil train routes. However Inslee said that states are limited in what we can do in creating regulations for interstate railroads. Railroads engage in interstate commerce which means the buck stops with the federal government. While federal regulators acknowledge the risks of crude by rail they have taken few steps toward increasing safety Inslee wrote in an op ed for the Columbian last year. The combination of federal preemption and federal inaction is unacceptable. Inslee urged Congress and the US Department of Transportation to implement even tougher regulations including lower speed limits for high hazard flammable trains and to use safer cars that are strong enough to protect volatile contents from the heat of a fire or the impact of a collision. However the group said that Inslee has failed to craft an emissions reduction strategy and the state continues to move towards a dizzying array of new fossil fuel developments. If I can stop an oil train Governor Jay Inslee can stop an oil terminal Chris one of the protesters said in a statement. Ultimately Shut Down Fossil Fuels is calling for an end to oil trains oil terminals and all fossil fuels. Its now or never. Were up against the wire and nobody no politician no agency no industry is stepping up to resolve the climate crisis Mike one of the protesters locked to a flower pot said in a statement. Its time for the people to step up to resolve this crisis before we run out of time. Sophie Scholl another media liaison for the group told RT that there has been a second blockade of a train up north following the arrests in downtown Vancouver.	False	False	False	False	False
Reuters Climate change will cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century damaging everything from human health to infrastructure and agricultural production according to a government report issued on Friday. The Congressionally mandated report written with the help of more than a dozen U.S. government agencies and departments outlined the projected impacts of global warming in every corner of American society in a dire warning at odds with the Trump administrations pro fossil fuels agenda. With continued growth in emissions at historic rates annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century more than the current gross domestic product GDP of many U.S. states according to the report. It said global warming would disproportionately hurt the poor broadly undermine human health damage infrastructure limit the availability of water alter coastlines and boost costs in industries from farming to energy production. While it said that many of the impacts of climate change including more frequent and more powerful storms droughts and flooding are already underway the projections of further damage could change if greenhouse gas emissions are sharply curbed Future risks from climate change depend primarily on decisions made today it said. The report the Fourth National Climate Assessment Volume II supplements a study issued last year that concluded humans are the main driver of global warming and which warned of potentially catastrophic effects to the planet. The studies clash with policy under President Donald Trump who has been rolling back Obama era environmental and climate protections to maximize production of domestic fossil fuels including crude oil already the highest in the world above Saudi Arabia and Russia. Trump last year announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris Deal agreed by nearly 200 nations to combat climate change arguing the accord would hurt the U.S. economy and provide little tangible environmental benefit. Trump and several members of his cabinet have also repeatedly cast doubt on the science of climate change arguing the causes and impacts are not yet settled. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Environmental groups said the report reinforced their calls for the United States to take action on climate change. This report makes it clear that climate change is not some problem in the distant future. Its happening right now in every part of the country said Brenda Ekwurzel the director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists and one of the reports authors. Previous research including from U.S. government scientists has also concluded that climate change could have severe economic consequences including damage to infrastructure water supplies and agriculture. Severe weather and other impacts also increase the risk of disease transmission decrease air quality and can increase mental health problems among other effects. Thirteen government departments and agencies from the Agriculture Department to NASA were part of the committee that compiled the new report.

Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortezs newly released Green New Deal resolution has gotten a lot of attention for its 100 percent renewable energy goal but the bill also vaguely references another source of emissions. The resolution calls for aWorld War II style mobilization effort to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural operations. If thats the case that means any subsequent Green New Deal legislation would have to deal with a major source of methane emissions cow flatulence. Methane makes up 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions that scientists blame for global warming. Enteric fermentation the digestive process in cows and other ruminant animals is the largest source of U.S. methane emissions according to Environmental Protection Agency EPA data. EPA says cattle account for the majority of methane emissions in the United States for this source category referring to emissions from enteric fermentation. RELATED Alexandria Ocasio Cortez Green New Deal Is About Social Justice Being a non binding resolution the Green New Deal doesnt offer any specifics on how livestock emissions would be phased down or eliminated. The question then becomes How do you eliminate emissions from cows sheep and other animals? Certainly environmental groups have increasingly called for getting beef out of peoples diets in the name of the climate but there are legitimate worries doing so would be a net negative on overall public health. Some scientists have looked into reducing flatulence from ruminant animals. The U.S. government funded a 2014 study to find out why some types of sheep burped and farted more than others. The Obama administration released a plan to clamp down on methane emissions in 2014 which included programs to cut emissions from dairy operations. Republican lawmakers worried the Obama era effort could have resulted in new regulations or taxes on farmers. Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide but makes up a much smaller slice of Americas emissions profile. Natural gas systems and landfills also emit methane which Democrats and environmentalists want to regulate more.

The United States is still reeling from last years megadisasters. Puerto Rico lingers in the longest blackout in US history after Hurricane Maria tore through the island and the scorched earth left behind from record breaking fires in California is now causing floods and mudslides. The Federal Emergency Management Agency which was on the front lines of many of these calamities had to go back to Congress last September to ask for billions more dollars to handle the gargantuan relief efforts. With some of the dust settled its clear that the events in 2017 fit the pattern of extreme weather we expect as average global temperatures go up with strong climate change signals emerging in fires and rainfall. FEMA has and will continue to respond to climate change influenced disasters. But the agencys new strategic plan for 2018 2022 released Thursday doesnt mention climate change or global warming at all. Thats despite the fact that the 38 page document projects more frequent and more expensive disasters. This is a glaring omission from an agency that deals with anticipating and responding to weather extremes driven in part by a changing climate. The damages from the hurricanes heat waves wildfires and tornadoes in 2017 cost at least 306 billion. Disaster costs are expected to continue to increase due to rising natural hazard risk decaying critical infrastructure and economic pressures that limit investments in risk resilience according to the document. FEMA did signal that it wants to invest more in pre disaster mitigation which may or may not include climate change. But it wasnt so coy in its previous 2014 2018 strategic plan which noted that the agency will also ensure that future risks including those influenced by climate change are effectively integrated into the Agencys risk assessment resources and processes. Dropping climate change from FEMAs strategic plan is just the latest part of the Trump administrations long pattern of erasing climate change as a public policy issue across the federal government. Agencies including the Department of Energy the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior have removed climate change language from many of their websites. Other agencies have limited access to policy and technical documents dealing with climate change. And some government research grant applications faced extra scrutiny and rejection for mentioning the double C word. Its not just rhetoric. President Trump wants the United States to back out of the Paris climate agreement and the EPA is working to undo the main policy for restricting greenhouse gases the Clean Power Plan. The White Houses latest budget proposal seeks a 72 percent cut to clean energy research and reduces FEMAs budget by almost 600 million from 16.1 billion. The recent personnel shake up across the federal government doesnt bode well for the fight against climate change either. Rex Tillerson who was fired as secretary of state this week wanted the United States to remain in the Paris deal. His likely replacement Mike Pompeo doesnt believe humanity is warming the planet. And former White House adviser George David Banks who suggested that Trump could rejoin the Paris agreement resigned last month after he failed to get a security clearance due to past marijuana use. The net result is that the Trump administration is doing little to either mitigate or adapt to rising temperatures. And now homeowners many of whom received disaster relief money from FEMA are rebuilding in floodplains and high fire risk areas. It seems FEMA doesnt want to build on this history of climate disasters. Now it looks like were condemned to repeat it.	False	False	False	False	False
WASHINGTON Environmental advocates say now isthe time for decisive action on climate change. Democrats won the House in November riding a platformthat included a call to address the crisis. Global warming was blamed for intensifying natural disasters that killed dozens and cost billions of dollars across the country in 2018. Arecent avalanche of evidence that the climate is already changing radically has hardened the case for immediateaction. Climate change is here and now. And palpably getting worse. That is rapidly changing how Americans think about it David Doniger with the Natural Resources Defense Council wrote in a recent blog. The shift from 'future problem'to 'now crisis'is being fueled by blockbuster scientific reports and blockbuster real world catastrophes. And yetfew including Doniger expect Washingtonto do muchany time soon in the dramatic way scientistsare urging. President Donald Trump who in 2017 yanked the U.S. out of the Paris Accord on climate changecontinues to doubt the science and says radical action would only hurt the economy. At an international climate conference in Poland in December his emissariesdoubled down on the expansionof fossil fuels notably coal. And while incoming House Democratic leaders vow to make climate change a prioritywhen they take control Thursday their most ambitious proposals are expected to die in the GOP controlled Senate where Republicans remain resistant tofar reaching steps aimedat weaningthe nation off carbon. So for Democrats and their environmental allies the next two years in Washington are likely to be more about making a case to voters than actually scoring significant victories on climate change said Bob Shrum a longtime Democratic strategist who teaches political scienceat the University of Southern California. I don't think Trump's going to give an inch on this he said. I think we'll be at a stalemate for the next two years. But I think Democrats can prepare the ground can win the argument and can go into 2020 on these issues ina pretty strong position. Studies suggest there isn'tmuch time for politicking on the issue.Some of the effects are already taking place according to a landmark climate assessmentthe administration released in November. Climate change is contributing to extreme weather conditions the spread of new diseases by insects and pestsand changes to the availability of food and water the researchers say. But the dire warning has done little to prod Capitol Hill Republicans many of whom stillquestion the science behind climate change. Reluctant to cross Trump they barely discuss the issue these dayscompared to three years ago according to an analysis of press releases floor statements tweetsand Facebook posts by software firm Quorom. When Republicansdo talk about it therefrain is that innovation and incentive alone can solve the issue. One of the most notable achievements they toutwas passage of a tax credit to encourage the capture and storage of carbon emissions into the ground before they become airborne and contribute to global warming. More El Nios to strengthen because of global warming will cause 'more extreme weather' study says More Emissions of carbon dioxide into Earth's atmosphere reach record high But they roundly oppose dramatic steps such as a carbon taxto cut the nation off fossil fuels because it would increase the cost of energy. Wyoming GOP Sen. John Barrasso chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committeeand a sponsor of the carbon capture legislation opposes such punishing regulations. Making energy as clean as we can as fast as we can without raising costs to consumers will be accomplished through investment invention and innovation Barrasso wrote in a column for The New York Times. With carbon capture clean energy development and other advances the reliance on fossil fuels must stopas well if the planet has any hope of meeting the net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050 that scientists cite as a minimum to stave off the worst effects of a warming globe. That's a one two punch we need to solve the climate crisis said Conrad Schneider advocacy Director for the Clean Air Task Force a nonprofit organization pushing for carbon emission reduction. Neither alone is going to get it done. One of the few congressional Republicans willing to support a carbon tax is Florida Rep. Francis Rooney. Representing one of the country's reddest districts the former businessman from Oklahoma is a pro Trump conservative on most issues. But on climate change he is is an unflinching opponent largely because rising sea levels threaten his home state. I don't think we need to burn coal Rooney said. A carbon tax is the most market oriented nonbureaucratic efficient way I can see to kill off coal. And Rooney said the intransigence most of his fellow Republicans including President Trumpdisplay on the issue is harmful to the GOP brand and could come back to haunt them in 2020. We need to be reaching out to broaden our base and if you look at this last election our base is narrowing unfortunately he said. I talk to our kids and young people all the time and they are more environmentally sensitive they're more pro alternative energy they get the natural gas thing instead of coal. Tom Steyer the liberal California billionaire who is mulling a presidential run in 2020 believes climate change and Republicans' refusal to follow experts' advice despite the dire warnings will help Democratssweep into office two years from now. When we talk about what's at stake here we're talking about unimaginable suffering by the American people unless we solve the problem over the next 12 years he said recently. And I think that we're very far from doing that. And it is unclear to me that we can summon that will without having substantial political victories across the board.	False	False	False	False	False
In its report ETC insists that investments of up to 500 billion per annum would not pose a major macroeconomic challenge to nations accepting the call to fund the project. The group is made up of energy company executives activists investment bankers Al Gore and others who would financially benefit from the immense influx of funds the Daily Caller reports. According to the ETC website the groups goal is to accelerate change towards low carbon energy systems that enable robust economic development and limit the rise in global temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius. The chief avenue the group advocates to cut global warming is to force governments around the world to place an ever growing tax on carbon emissions as a means to force change in energy policy. The punishing taxes they say would cause the energy industry to seriously explore alternate energy sources and cut back use of fossil fuels. It recommends that the world cut emissions to a net zero by the year 2050 to hold back global heating. The group also calls for direct investment in green energy. ETC claims that the world must fundinvestment in renewables and other low carbon technologies some 6 trillion higher 300 billion per year while the largest required increases of almost 9 trillion 450 billion per year will be in more efficient energy saving equipment and buildings. ETC has focused its activism on the Paris climate agreement which President Obama signed onto without Senate approval. The plan was to take effect in 2016 but since coming to office President Trump has put a hold on much of the countrys compliance with the agreement. Trump has also begun considering whether or not to completely pull out of the agreement. Trumps Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt has urged the president to exit the agreement and at least one climate scientist Dr. Duane Thresher has warned Trump not to cave in to his daughters climate change madness.

Democrat presidential candidate and billionaire Tom Steyer once again vowed to declare a state of emergency over the climate crisis America faces during the sixth Democrat presidential debate at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles California. I am hoping that we in fact that we will do what I am suggesting that we do which is declare a state of emergency on day one of my presidency Steyer said in regards to the relocation of families under certain living conditions in America. I believe I am the only person here who will say unequivocally this is my number one priority Steyer continued. I know that we have to deal with this crisis. I know that we have to deal with it from the standpoint of environmental justice. Steyer then claimed he had previously taken on oil companies and beaten them on environmental laws and pushed clean energy across this country. He also stated that he had prevented pipelines and fossil fuel plants. Steyer then shifted focus to cleaning up the air and water in the black and brown communities where our pollution is concentrated and claimed it would create millions of middle class union jobs. Steyer also called on Mayor Pete Buttigieg another Democrat presidential hopeful to put more emphasis on climate change saying the people in his generation understand that this is a crisis that we have to go on right now and reinvent America. In addition to what he plans to do in regards to climate change Steyer also stated at a previous Democrat debate that he would force American towns to accept new affordable housing in certain areas.

Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt is expected to sign a proposed rule on Tuesday that would roll back a key piece of President Obamas climate legacy. But whats largely been lost in the conversation is how much the attempt to repeal the regulation on carbon dioxide emissions will impact peoples health. Pruitt wants to repeal Obamas Clean Power Plan the signature Environmental Protection Agency policy that aims to cut emissions from existing US power plants a big driver of climate change 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. While the big focus of the plan was reducing carbon emissions it also aimed to keep hundreds of thousands of tons of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution out of the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases are not only harmful to the environment but also increase the risk of everything from asthma to heart disease. The Clean Power Plan in other words though never implemented was a big win for health. According to the EPA cutting exposure to particle pollution in the order the CPP does would have averted up to 3600 premature deaths 90000 asthma attacks in children and 1700 heart attacks each year. Which means that the White Houses move to repeal the Clean Power Plan is a one two punch to human health and the environment said Georges Benjamin executive director of the American Public Health Association. Greenhouse gases are an enormous risk to human health. So this means well continue to be exposed to these gases which exacerbate asthma heart disease strokes. According to the Global Burden of Disease project more than 5 million people die worldwide each year because of air pollution and emissions from coal fired plants are a major risk factor here. Its one reason why health experts have been pushing policymakers to rapidly phase out of coal. For miners the immediate health risks include black lung disease and scarring of the lung tissue. But the pollutants emitted when coal is processed including sulfur dioxide particulate matter nitrogen oxides and mercury have much more far reaching effects on many more people. In one large study involving 450000 Americans followed between 1982 and 2004 researchers found that increased exposure to the particles in fossil fuel emissions increased the risk of death from heart disease and particles from coal burning were five times more damaging than other similar particles. Reducing emissions from coal fired power plants also makes it easier to breathe. Over the past 30 years the percentage of Americans with asthma has more than doubled and climate change has been a significant driver of that trend. Air pollution triggers asthma attacks contributing to lung abnormalities particularly in the developing pulmonary systems of children. For the White House bolstering the coal industry seems to trump these other matters. The war on coal is over Pruitt said Monday in Kentucky when he announced the move. For now the environmental community and some state governments are expected to oppose the rule in federal courts. The public health community should be there too. Health isnt a big part of the conversation about Trump administration assault on climate change mitigation policies but it needs to be. Its not just the future of the planet thats at stake here.

BNP Paribas on Wednesday became the first big bank to pledge to stop financing natural gas fracking projects as part of a new policy cheered by environmentalists as having the greatest impact of any financial giant yet. Under the new policy Frances largest bank will refuse to lend to companies who generate more than half their revenue from fracked oil gas or liquefied natural gas export terminals. The rules also apply to tar sands considered one of the dirtiest sources of oil. Multinational banks including BNP Paribas began putting strict limits on funding for coal projects in 2015. At that point coal was becoming an unprofitable investment and banks faced mounting pressure from environmentalists to stop supporting the dirtiest fuels in the lead up the Paris climate agreement. Last month JPMorgan Chase became the target of a new campaign urging it to end financing for companies that drill tar sands a particularly dirty source of oil that forms the backbone of Canadas industry. Until now no financial giant has clamped down on natural gas which produces far less carbon dioxide than oil or coal. The fuel now provides most of the United States electricity and is credited with reducing emissions by weaning the country off coal. That has allowed advocates to tout the gas as a critical tool in the transition from heavily polluting fuels to renewable energy. But fracking an extraction technique that involves shooting a highly pressurized chemical and sand laced water into shale rock to extract oil and gas has become a lightning rod for environmentalists. It produces toxic wastewater and leaks emissions of methane a far more most potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. And the process of liquefying natural gas from vapor requires so much energy it ends up being as dirty as coal. The scientific literature on the climate impact of gas especially fracked gas is emerging Jason Disterhoft a senior campaigner at Rainforest Action Network told HuffPost by phone. Now that the prices of solar and wind energy were plummeting theres less need to use natural gas as a stepping stone between dirtier fossil fuels and renewables he added. BNP Paribas offered few details on its new policy including when it would go into effect though it said it should have an update by the end of the year. Europes second largest bank also said that companies could continue to receive backing if they lower the amount of revenue earned from fracking or tar sands to less than half their business. The exact ratio has not yet been decided a spokeswoman said. Even though were going to have this policy in place doesnt mean at the same time well right away cut all the clients that dont fall under it Mylene Benmoussa a BNP Paribas spokeswoman told HuffPost by phone on Wednesday. Its going to be a gradual and shared transition. The bank had not not yet calculated how many clients would be affected by the new policy and could not immediately respond to questions about how much money is invested in the targeted sectors. France banned fracking in 2011. The country generates 11 percent of its electricity from gas according to data from RTE the French transmission operator. And the government in Paris announced plans last month to prohibit oil and gas production by 2040. For a bank in the regulatory environment BNP Paribas is facing an aggressive climate policy makes business sense. Yet the announcement garnered praise from three environmental groups that teamed up to pressure BNP Paribas to curtail support for fossil fuels that pose a particular threat of exacerbating climate change. The trio includes the San Francisco based Rainforest Action Network the French chapter of Friends of Earth and Save the Rio Grande Valley from Liquefied Natural Gas a local Texas group protesting the construction of a liquefied natural gas terminal in the states southern region. Still the move represents a public relations victory for a bank plagued by scandals in recent years. In 2015 the company was ordered to pay 8.9 billion to the U.S. for violating sanctions against Sudan Cuba and Iran. In June three human rights groups accused BNP Paribas of complicity in the 1994 Rwandan genocide that killed more than 800000 people. In July the Federal Reserve fined the firm 246 million for its unsafe and unsound practices in foreign currency trading division failing to crack down on employees who violated rules on sharing information with competitors. Were a long standing partner to the energy sector and were determined to support the transition to a more sustainable world BNP Paribas CEO Jean Laurent Bonnaf said in a statement.As an international bank our role is to help drive the energy transition and contribute to the decarbonization of the economy.

WASHINGTON President Trumps decision to back out of the Paris climate accord is a blow to environmental activists but the nation's steady years long reduction in greenhouse gas emissionsthat contribute to global warming wont suddenly stop. Utility companies have announced plans to fully or partially close more than a half dozen coal fired power plants since Trump took office fewer than five months ago taking some of the nations largest greenhouse gas emitters off line. AndWall Street fund managers and large businesses are moving away from fossil fuels due to market conditions further contributing to increased use of cleaner energy sources. Since 2010 more than 250 coal fired power plants have closed in the U.S. On Wednesday Exxon Mobil shareholders voted against the boards recommendation to require the company publicly report on the risks to its business posed by climate change. The United States is making progress said John Coequyt Global Climate Policy Director for the Sierra Club. Were moving forward. We believe the rest of the world will do the same. Trump has already taken unilateral steps to roll back regulations that were designed to implement the Paris agreement including reversing President Obama's Clean Power Plan rule that sought to lower greenhouseemissions. Trumpcampaigned on a promise to withdraw the U.S.from the accord saying it would lead to higher energy prices and hurt domesticbusinesses from being able to compete globally. As president I have one obligation and that obligation is to the Americanpeople Trump said during a speech in theRose Garden announcingthe decision. The Paris Accord would undermineour economy hamstring ourworkers weaken oursovereignty impose unacceptable legal risk and put us at a permanentdisadvantageto the other countiesof the world. The internationalagreement which was signed in 2015 and went into effect seven months ago is considered a major part theenvironmental legacy of the Obama administration. Michael A. Needham chief executive officer of the conservative Heritage Action for America applauded the president's move. Withdrawal from the agreement marks a critical step in unraveling former President Obamas destructive legacy Needham said. Not only did Obama make this agreement without approval from Congress but in doing so he handed more control of Americas energy to foreign officials. Experts say pulling out of the accord will slow but hardly stop the momentum that's been building to keepa global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels. Under current policy the U.S. is still set to come within striking distance of meeting its 2020 goal under a prior U.N. climate change accordto reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17 below 2005 levels according to a report by energy analysts the Rhodium Group. But the analysis said withdrawing from the accord makes it very unlikely the U.S. will meet the26 28 target set out under the Paris deal. The exit from the accord will allow states such as California and New York to play a leading role in meeting climate change targets. California for example has stood out with its toughest in the nation vehicle emissions laws that often effectively establish auto industrystandards nationwide. California Gov. Jerry Brown said he hopes Trump's insane move to back out of the Paris accord will spur others to action. California will resist he told reporters on a conferencecall after Trump's announcement.California is all in. We're on the field ready for battle and while our president may be AWOL in the battle against climate change we're not.	False	False	False	False	False
Donors to conservative candidates should also finance media projects that promote their values. Politics is downstream from culture is an aphorism the late conservative iconoclast Andrew Breitbart was famous for coining He believed that in the end the people who win elections are the ones telling the best stories and controlling the narrative on any issue. In 2016 Donald Trump won in part because Make America Great Again encapsulated a better story than Hillary Clintons tepid Stronger Together. But popular culture whether it be books TV film music or video games remain dominated by the Left. Sandwiched between much of our entertainment are messages that perpetuate liberal themes The military is bloodthirsty radical Muslims must be handled with kid gloves trial lawyers and climate change activists are crusading heroes and above all corporations are evil. When they are not being greedy or trying to dominate the world they are responsible for polluting the planet. Narratives like the ones above dont get turned into stories by accident. The Tides Foundation which featured Barack Obama on its board before he became president has spent nearly a billion dollars in the past 20 years serving as a cutout for liberal donors who dont want to be identified with a particular cause. One of the most touted projects it has steered donors to is Participant Media an activist entertainment company that produces movies with a message. Among the films Participant has championed are George Clooneys CIA conspiracy thrillers Al Gores climate change documentaries and a docudrama celebrating Ruth Bader Ginsburgs legal career. Another genre beloved by Participant filmmakers is the corporate polluter drama. Dark Waters a film in which a crusading trial lawyer is pitted against the DuPont chemical company is being released nationwide this month. Picking up where Erin Brockovich left off the film asserts that DuPont ignored the dangers posed by a group of chemicals PFAS that were used in nonstick cookware and firefighting. Trial lawyers sued DuPont in 2001 alleging that 80000 people in Ohio and West Virginia had been exposed to PFAS in their drinking water. The case dragged on for years until DuPont and Chemours Company which spun off from DuPont settled some 3500 injury lawsuits for a total of 671 million. No one doubts that there was real liability in the case but Dark Waters is a conspiracy horror movie that ignores facts to shake up its audience. A clear giveaway is that the movie begins with the disclaimer inspired by true events rather than the more commonly used based on a true story. The film ignores recent studies that have found no causal link between PFAS chemicals and infections or dental cavities. Also ignored that the Centers for Disease Control report that the blood levels of PFAS compounds in people have dropped dramatically since the 20 year old events depicted in the story. But the film has served as a springboard for calls to environmental activism. The House Oversight Committee conducted a hearing on PFAS issues last month. Dark Waters leading star Mark Ruffalo was the main witness. Ruffalo best known to filmgoers for playing the Incredible Hulk is an outspoken political extremist. This month he sent out a tweet calling for an economic revolution because in his view capitalism is failing us killing us and robbing from our childrens future. Hes even criticized liberal TV host Ellen DeGeneres for socializing with George W. Bush because the former president hasnt been brought to justice for the crimes of the Iraq War. The real agenda behind Dark Waters is to try to vilify chemical companies and characterize them as the next Big Tobacco. They can then be made a juicy target for both trial lawyers and government regulators. In a CNN interview last month Ruffalo directly linked the issues around PFAS to alleged attempts by government to hide science surrounding fossil fuels not to mention Exxon and climate change. But just last week a New York judge found Exxon not guilty of misleading shareholders on climate change blowing up Ruffalos straw man. The Exxon case shows that the agenda of the left wing groups behind Dark Waters is a moving target one always guided by the trial lawyers laser like focus on the deepest pocketbook. The Left has long understood the role that popular culture can play in shaping politics. Conservatives have largely ignored the radicalization of Hollywood in this struggle. Its time that many people who give money to conservative candidates recognize the need also to finance media projects that promote their values. One example is a proposed big budget biographical film about Ronald Reagan starring Dennis Quaid. Its producers are still searching for final financing before they begin production. If conservatives wind up losing elections and thereby ceding public policy to the Left they will have only themselves to blame for ignoring the war over popular culture that has been steering younger voters to think in more radical terms.

But Pruitt has also been a reliable ally for President Donald Trump who made easing regulations on American industries a central campaign promise and the EPA administrator has proposed a slew of rollbacks for major environmental rules including those governing clean air and water and fighting climate change. Put together Pruitt's moves some of which have been challenged in court represent an attempt to fundamentally restructure the EPA's role in Washington and are a sharp rebuke of the environmental legacy of former President Barack Obama. Here are some of Pruitt's key changes Like others in the Trump administration Pruitt has repeatedly highlighted uncertainty about the role that humans have played in global warming a view that is at odds with the vast majority of scientific evidence. Last month the EPA circulated talking points instructing its staffers to say clear gaps exist in understanding whether human activity contributes to climate change. The EPA also removed references to climate change from several webpages according to an analysis by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative. The weakening of automobile standards which is a win for car manufacturers and a blow to environmentalists also sets up a fight between the Trump administration and the state of California which says it plans to stick with the stricter rules. Proposing an overhaul of Obama era initiatives on coal ash In March the EPA proposed changes to the Obama era directive regulating coal ash waste giving states and utilities more power to manage their own disposal of it. The proposal according to The Washington Post includes more than a dozen changes for how coal ash which remains when coal is burned in power plants and electricity is generated is stored at coal fired power plants nationwide and would let states change how frequently they test for groundwater contamination. The decision was praised by industry officials who had called on Pruitt to revisit the rules but environmental groups said he was caving to special interests in the coal industry. The EPA announced in January that it was withdrawing the once in always in policy under the Clean Air Act that dictated how major sources of hazardous air pollutants are regulated. The decades old policy was opposed by fossil fuel companies but environmental groups argued that its withdrawal would result in more pollution. The EPA announced in January that it would suspend the Waters of the United States rule which was designed to limit pollution in roughly 60 of the country's bodies of water. Critics said the rule was overly broad in classifying waterways that are subject to federal rules while supporters see it as a necessary protection for example preventing fertilizer runoff from tainting streams and drinking water. Pruitt announced in October his decision to withdraw from the Clean Power Plan the Obama era rule intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants across the country. The Clean Power Plan had a goal of decreasing the country's carbon pollution by roughly one third by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. Under Pruitt the EPA tried to suspend an Obama era rule to restrict methane emissions from new oil and gas wells. But a federal court ruled in August that the EPA must enforce the Obama administration's regulation. Pushing to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord Pruitt pushed the White House to leave the Paris climate deal stood beside the President in the Rose Garden when he announced the decision and after the President spoke offered his own remarks. The move was condemned by global leaders and was seen by many as a setback to efforts to address global warming.	False	False	False	False	False
We havent heard much about a national cap and trade system to curb carbon emissions since plans for one died in Congress about a decade ago. But tonight at the CNN climate forum Beto ORourke the former congressman from Texas revived the idea as his preferred method of pricing carbon. Under such a system the government issues a limited number of allowances or permits to companies and other entities that emit carbon dioxide essentially creating a cap on emissions. California and states across the Eastern Seaboard have used the system for the past several years to reduce emissions from the power sector. In the 5 trillion climate plan that Mr. ORourke released in April he indicated he would pursue some type of carbon pricing to reach his goal of net zero emissions by 2050 but didnt specify an approach. In response to a question from Priya Subberwal a New York University student Mr. ORourke made clear that he prefers cap and trade over a straight tax on carbon. We should certainly price carbon. I think the best possible path to do that is through a cap and trade system he said. Its the best way to send a pricing signal. The revenue from a cap and trade program he said would be reinvested in helping communities move toward clean energy. Mr. ORourke promised to surprise surprise re enter the Paris agreement on Day 1. He also pledged to lead the world in going well beyond the Paris climate agreement prevent new oil and gas leases on federal lands and bring back Obama era climate regulations like fuel economy standards and restrictions on coal fired power plants. The former Texas congressman was also one of the few candidates who explicitly tied Hurricane Dorian to newly proposed policies. He called for extending temporary protected status to anyone who wants to seek shelter here from the Bahamas which has been overwhelmed by the hurricane. Asylum laws Mr. ORourke said should include those who have been impacted by climate change. Its the right thing to do. Mr. ORourke was less clear about whether he believes people in his home state of Texas should be prevented from living in vulnerable flood areas. He said the government should help people move but avoided answering a question from the moderator Don Lemon about whether some areas were simply too risky for human habitation. One area where the Texan came down strong No limits on the meat industry despite calls from the United Nations for people to change their diet to avoid more damage to global land use. I reject any notion that we have to radically or fundamentally change how we eat or what we eat I think we just have to be more responsible in the way that we do it and the best way to do that is to allow the market to respond by setting a price on carbon he said.

President Donald Trump's Earth Day message greatly differed in tone from his predecessor by not mentioning climate change. The president's statement focused on the beauty of nature and the importance of preserving it for future generations. He said in the second paragraph 'economic growth enhances environmental protection.' This point was reiterated later in a somewhat defensive tweet. Trump said 'I am committed to keeping our air and water clean but always remember that economic growth enhances environmental protection. Jobs matter!' By comparison last year President Obama's message in 2016 took on an urgent tone and said 'Human activity is disrupting the climate and the challenge of combating climate change is one that will define the contours of our time.' However Obama did not mention climate change in 2010 or 2012 statements important midterm and general election years according to AOL. President Bush also pointed to climate change in his 2009 Earth Day statement 'We are taking positive steps to confront the important challenge of climate change. Our work is not done.' President Trump's administration executive orders and tweets indicate he is not a believer in climate change. In 2013 on a chilly day at Trump Tower he tweeted 'Another freezing day in the Spring what is going on with global warming? Good move changing the name to climate change sad!' In a flurry of other tweets he criticized President Obama for prioritizing the environment over other issues such as 'ISIS and Ebola.' On Earth Day thousands of scientists students and research advocatesmarched around the world in protest of Trump's research budget cuts. Many of the signs at the rallies referenced climate change specifically. On Friday Trump asked the Surgeon General Dr Vivek Murthy to resign from his post.Murthy previously spoke out against climate changed and called it aserious danger to public health.

The office issued news releases relating to investigations at a dizzying rate with less emphasis on follow through or actual results said Caroline Polisi a white collar defense lawyer who has appeared as a legal commentator on cable news shows. But Ms. Polisi added that there had been considerable substance to a number of Mr. Schneidermans investigations as well as some major successes. Mr. Schneidermans big accomplishment in going after Wall Street were the billions of dollars in penalties that he helped secure from big banks that had sold flawed mortgage backed bonds during the run up to the financial crisis. He ensured that some of that money went to help communities across the state that were overrun by abandoned houses and foreclosures often referred to as zombie homes. His legal team was one of the first in the nation to target banks for sponsoring nontransparent trading platforms called dark pools which allowed high speed trading firms to take advantage of investors. In 2016 Mr. Schneiderman and the Securities and Exchange Commission announced a 154 million settlement with Barclays and Credit Suisse to resolve allegations that the banks had permitted traders to misuse their dark pool platforms. Three years ago he opened an investigation with the Massachusetts attorney general into whether Exxon Mobil deliberately misled the public and investors about the impact of climate change. In 2015 Mr. Schneidermans office opened an investigation into the mortgage practices of Caliber Home Loans a fast growing lender but has said nothing about the inquiry since then. A spokeswoman said that the office generally avoided providing details about the number of open investigations. But Barbara Underwood who was named New Yorks acting attorney general on Tuesday said in a statement that the offices work continues without interruption. Mr. Schneiderman over the past year has positioned himself at the vanguard of legal challenges by state attorneys general to the Trump administrations efforts to roll back regulation especially environmental rules. Last month he and more than a dozen states sued the E.P.A. for failing to properly control methane pollution a greenhouse gas.	False	False	False	False	False
A federal reportlast year found that about a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions in the United States come from fossil fuel extraction on federal land. As the Trump administration continues its push to expand such development top candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination agree that Americas public land must be a tool in the fight against climate change not a contributor to the problem. During CNNs marathon town hall on climate change Wednesday candidates vowed to end oil gas and coal leasing on federal land as part of a shared goal to decarbonizing the economy and prevent catastrophic warming. Sen. Kamala Harris D Calif. and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julin Castro said they would also work to expand federally protected acreage. We actually need to undo the damage that this administration has done and then expand the lands that were protecting in our country Castro said. We can do that. Most of the 10 Democratic candidates who appeared on stage Wednesday have released climate plans that call for reversing Trumps sweeping land rollbacks safeguarding new sites or fully funding the popular Land and Water Conservation Fund which uses offshore fossil fuel revenue to protect natural areas and water resources. Castro Harris Sen. Cory Booker D N.J. and former Vice President Joe Biden have all committed to working toward protecting 30 of Americas land and water by 2030. The next president must be ready to lead the climate response we need to see on our shared lands and waters Huntley said. If we are going to keep pace with what science demands we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions on our public lands while also restoring protections for threatened forests from the Southern Appalachians to Alaskas Tongass National Forest. Ahead of Wednesdays forum Harris released a 10 trillion climate plan that calls for diversifying the marine and land ecosystems that we protect and targeting biodiversity hotspots and critical wildlife corridors as well as using existing presidential authorities to set aside critical landscapes. Bidens plan promises to permanently protect areas like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge a pristine Alaska wilderness that the Trump administration is working to open to oil drilling and to set up programs to reforest and expand renewable energy on federal lands. Castros 10 trillion climate plan also released this week calls for designating new national monuments parks and wildlife refuge and outlines a so called Green Opportunity Corps that would put 15000 young adults to work in areas like public land conservation. He is the only candidate to put out an animal and wildlife welfare policy which seeks to end euthanasia for household dogs and cats and strengthen protections for endangered species. We need to connect the dots Castro said Wednesday. Ive connected the dots of actually preserving more of our lands both for the benefit of wildlife and for our benefit to combat climate change. Sen. Elizabeth Warren D Mass. was not asked Wednesday about how she would approach Americas public lands and waters despite being the only candidate to release a comprehensive plan specific to protecting them. Her policy vision unveiled in April includes overturning Trumps land rollbacks a moratorium on oil and gas leases on federal land and recruiting 10000 youth and veterans for a 21st Century Civilian Conservation Corps. Its not enough to end our public lands contribution to climate change Warren wrote in an announcement at the time. We have an enormous opportunity to make them a part of the climate solution and for both economic and environmental reasons we should take it. All 10 candidates that participated in the CNN climate forum have voiced support for the Green New Deal the landmark resolution unveiled in February by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D N.Y. and Sen. Ed Markey D Mass. and that outlined lofty goals of reaching net zero emissions by midcentury. Supporters of the Green New Dealhave said public land is key to its success. The plan calls for ensuring that public lands waters and oceans are protected and restoring and protecting threatened endangered and fragile ecosystems. Questions posed to candidates on Wednesday varied and not all were asked about public land and conservation. But nearly all have policy proposals that drive home the need for the nation to be a better environmental steward. Former Rep. Beto ORourke Texas says he would go beyond previous presidents to protect our most wild beautiful and biodiverse places for generations to come including more of the Arctic and of our sensitive landscapes and seascapes than ever before.

Sen. Bernie Sanders I Vt. upped the ante in his progressive agenda on Thursday when he signaled support forcriminal charges against executives at oil companies. Fossil fuel executives should be criminally prosecuted for the destruction they have knowingly caused Sanders tweeted. His comments were the latest in progressive politicians'long line of attacks on big corporations and their role in climate change. It came on the same day that he released a sweeping 16 trillion plan to address climate change. Sanders paintedhis Green New Dealas a way to end the greed of the fossil fuel industry. OCASIO CORTEZ 'THERE'S NO DEBATE' THAT FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION SHOULD STOP We are going to end the greed of the fossil fuel industry and move to 100 renewable energy he tweeted in an attack on natural gas. Sanders' website indicated that he would as president direct his Justice Department to pursue criminal charges against companies like Exxon. These executives have spent hundreds of millions of dollars protecting their profits at the expense of our future and they will do whatever it takes to squeeze every last penny out of the Earth his website reads. Bernie promises to go further than any other presidential candidate in history to end the fossil fuel industrys greedincluding by making the industry pay for its pollution and prosecuting it for the damage it has caused. The American Petroleum Institute a trade association for the oil and gas industry responded to Sanders in a statement to Fox News. Pitting important environmental goals against working families who rely on affordable American energy is a false choice the organization said. While some may use attacks on natural gas and oil to energize their political base our industry will remain focused on providing the energy that powers Americas economy and modern lifestyle while also continuing to lower carbon emissions beyond their current generational low. While Sanders' pledge seemed unprecedented left wing attacks on big oil are nothing new. Former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman led a coalition of more than a dozen states in investigating ExxonMobil over allegations it misled the public about climate change. That turned into a federal lawsuit alleging the oil giant defrauded its shareholders with its messaging on climate change.Schneiderman resigned in 2018 amid allegations of physical abuse but legal battles continued to swirl around the company. Sanders' plan along with other Democratic climate change proposals wouldlikely inflict a heavy financial toll on companies like Exxon as Democrats embraced timelines that would drastically reduce carbon emissions within just decades of implementation. Congressional Democrats have for example proposed a carbon tax as a way to cut carbon emissions by 100 percent by 2050. The bill would purportedlyrebatea majority 70 percent ofrevenues from the tax to low and middle income Americans as a monthly dividend while spending the rest on infrastructure energy innovation and helping communities transition to a cleaner energy economy. The right leaning Competitive Enterprise Institute indicatedthat businesses would collectively face trillions of dollars in costs as they upgraded commercial and industrial buildings. For example the study found that the battleground state of Pennsylvania would face over 2 trillion in costs for upgrading residential commercialand industrial buildings. Florida would encounter a 1.4 trillion price tag andNew Hampshire the first primary state would face 102.8 billion in retrofitting costs. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sanders andothers have claimed their plans would benefit the economy. The Vermont senator predicted his plan would create 20 million jobs and pay for itself over 15 years. The cost of inaction is unacceptable Sanders' website claimed. Economists estimate that if we do not take action we will lose 34.5 trillion in economic activity by the end of the century. And the benefits are enormous by taking bold and decisive action we will save 2.9 trillion over 10 years 21 trillion over 30 years and 70.4 trillion over 80 years. 	False	False	False	False	False
A Green Island moss bank with icebergs.Credit Matt Amesbury Antarctica is a cold white continent at the bottom of the world. Or so it has been for thousands of years. New evidence points to a sharp increase in biological activity in recent decades across the Antarctic Peninsula resulting in large swaths of newfound greenery. Published in the journal Current Biology a new study found major increases in Antarctic moss growth over the past 50 years which the team of researchers attributes to temperature rises in the region. another clear sign that the biology of the planet is changing as a result of warming temperatures said Professor Dan Charman of the University of Exeter who led the research project. surprised us was just how rapid the changes have been and the fact that they are very unusual when compared with growth rates in the late 19th and early 20th century. Charman said their evidence shows just how fast Antarctic land surface can change along with climactic changes. The Antarctic Peninsula is among the most rapidly warming areas in the world with temperatures having increased by almost three degrees Celsius over the last 50 years. In March a research base near the northern tip of the Antarctic peninsula set a heat record of 17.5 degrees Celsius 63.5 Fahrenheit. Currently plant life only exists on about 0.3 of Antarctica. Charman said that while as the Arctic warms a variety of plant life and soil organisms can migrate north in Antarctica there are no nearby land areas for species to colonize from. But while no new natural plant life is anticipated existing plant life such as Antarctic hairgrass and Antarctic pearlwort could occupy new ice free ground as glaciers retreat. Dr. Matt Amesbury also of the University of Exeter said there were two main findings to take from their new study scale and temperature sensitivity Before now studies have been from single sites but using a transect of sites weve been able to show that this significant response to climate change is pervasive across the whole of the Antarctic Peninsula. The second important point is our finding which suggests that moss growth has been highly sensitive to temperature change since the 1950sunder future warming scenarios this means we are likely to see a greening of the Antarctic Peninsula both in terms of further increases in growth rates and also expansion of mosses and other plant life.

Over the last two weeks weve heard a lot of folderol and bambosh about Republicans conservatives Texans etc. not believing in science because recent hurricanes have been bad and climate change is causing it and blah blah blah. As you can probably tell I dont think much of all that. We had a historic lull in hurricanes until the lull was over. Once the hurricanes started back up so did the claim that climate change caused the hurricanes just as the scientists predicted the same scientists who didnt predict the lull. Similarly California had a historic drought that recently came to an end. Most of the climate models say that California should get wetter because of global warming. But that didnt stop President Obama and others from suggesting the dry spell was a symptom of climate change. Then when California experienced huge amounts of precipitation suddenly the models were prescient. But look I dont want to debate global warming because a its boring to me b you get screamed at by people who act like we have seconds to act before the world ends and c you or at least I also get screamed at by people who insist its all a complete hoax. For those interested Im basically in the Matt Ridley lukewarmercamp. Now back to my point. This whole dont believe in science canard amounts to ackamarackus bordering on flimflam. Even if you were a 100 percent denier of climate change that wouldnt necessarily mean you dont believe in science. Indeed many of the hardcore rejectionists I know are really really really into the science of climate change tell the guys at CEI they dont believe in science I dare you. They just tend to think the prevailing consensus is a politically and journalistically contrived sham. But even if you are a denier without being a science dork that doesnt necessarily mean you dont believe in science. Rejecting one scientific finding whether accurate or inaccurate doesnt mean you must reject all science never mind suggest that you dont believe in it. To be honest I dont know what people who say you dont believe in science think they mean when they say it. Climate deniers dont insist the world is flat though I have to assume flat earthers have unconventional views on atmospheric science. They dont refuse to take medical treatment or prescribed drugs. They have faith that the internal combustion engine is based on sound science. Etc. Often when I stupidly engage people who sincerely claim that Republicans or conservatives dont believe in science I like to point out that many liberals and leftists have problems with science too. People who want to ban golden rice or other GMOs people who deny that a fetus is a whole human people who insist fetal pain is a myth people who get outraged by claims that say men cant get pregnant. The list goes on and on. And yet I dont argue that Democrats dont believe in science. You know why? Because that would be stupid. Anyway what brought all this to mind was a story in the Washington Post this morning. Apparently researchers claim they can tell whether youre a homosexual or lesbian by using facial recognition software. The results arent perfect they claim but the computers apparently do better than humans at guessing which team you play for or secretly want to play for but dont. Not surprisingly gay rights groups are angry! They dont like it! And to be honest I can understand why. But thats not the point. Both GLAAD and Human Rights Watch cant seem to decide whether the science is bad because its fake and flawed or bad because it might work. A representative of GLAAD said something interesting Technology cannot identify someones sexual orientation. Wait a second. Who says? Maybe this effort isnt up to snuff yet. But saying that technology can never identify someones sexual orientation strikes me as pretty anti sciencey unless were now back to saying sexual orientation is a choice which opens a whole new kettle of fish. Anyway Im not sure what I think about this technology or its ramifications but I have no problem with the notion that science will be able to figure out these things and well probably find out that some things are wired some are a choice and most are a mix of the two. The point is that opponents dont like this science because of the political and social consequences of it. Maybe theres a parallel here with some deniers of climate change. But only those deniers get accused of not believing in science.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Thursday openly dismissed concerns raised by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson about President Donald Trump's decision to exit the Paris Climate Treaty. Tillerson a former ExxonMobil CEO told senators during his January confirmation hearing that the U.S. should stay engaged in global warming mitigation instead of walking away. 'It's important that the U.S. maintains its seat at the table about how to address the threat of climate change which does require a global response' Tillerson said then. And he has fretted privately to confidants that withdrawing from the Paris deal could both undercut America's credibility on other multilateral agreements and impair relationships with foreign allies. The U.S. commerce chief told Fox News just minutes after Trump blasted the climate agreement as a wealth transfer gimmick that Tillerson is wrong. 'I have a great deal of respect for Secretary Tillerson. I happen to disagree strongly with him on this particular issue.' He added that 'I just don't see the connection frankly' between the Paris pullout and America's trustworthiness in future negotiations. 'I don't agree with that at all. There's no reason to make one agreement connect with another' Ross said using the Trans Pacific Partnership as Exhibit A. 'The sky didn't fall when we pulled out of TPP and the sky certainly won't fall now that we've pulled out of the Paris Accord' he said. 'I think the president is right.' Ross said much of the predicted backlash from other countries that drive global warming concerns would be rooted in economics not science. 'Any time that people were taking money out of your pocket and you make them put it back in they're not going to be happy. And that's what's happening here' he said. 'This wasn't about climate. It was about U.S. money going to other countries.' Ross has firmly rooted himself in the train of thought that sees climate change agreements as thinly veiled pretexts for demanding global payouts from Washington and a free ride for its trade adversaries. 'The president made clear we already are far ahead of other countries in terms of CO2 reduction' Ross said describing U.S. efforts to reduce carbon outputs. 'And how can it be an effective deal when it allows China and India two of the major polluters to keep increasing their pollution for another decade or two?' 'That doesn't sound to me like a climate accord' he said. 'It simply sounds like a transfer of wealth from the United States to other countries.' Tillerson on the other hand has aggressively pushed for greater recognition of America's obligation to lead the charge. Three weeks ago he signed an international document establishing the importance of the Paris Treaty in tackling climate change. The Fairbanks Declaration was adopted at the meeting by the members of the Arctic Council whose members like the U.S. have territory above the Arctic Circle. The declaration says that the Arctic 'is warming at more than twice the rate of the global average resulting in widespread social environmental and economic impacts in the Arctic and worldwide.' Last year just one day before Trump was elected Tillerson told a conference in Abu Dhabi that 'at ExxonMobil we share the view that the risks of climate change are serious and warrant thoughtful action. Addressing these risks requires broad based practical solutions around the world.' 'Importantly as a result of the Paris agreement both developed and developing countries are now working together to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions' he said then 'while recognizing differing national responsibilities capacities and circumstances.' Tillerson who met with the president on Wednesday in a last ditch effort to change his mind about pulling out of the Paris Accord did not attend Thursday's Rose Garden announcement that America's participation was at an end.

Reuters The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will unveil a proposal to speed state level permitting decisions for energy infrastructure projects soon the agencys chief told Reuters on Thursday blasting states that have blocked coal terminals and gas pipelines on environmental grounds. President Donald Trump is seeking to boost domestic fossil fuels production over the objections of Democrats and environmentalists concerned about pollution and climate change. On Wednesday he issued a pair of executive orders targeting the power of states to delay energy projects. We started working on it in advance so we hope to have something out soon EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in an interview. He was unable to provide a precise timeline. Based on Trumps orders Wheelers EPA has been tasked with clarifying a section of the U.S. Clean Water Act that has allowed states like New York and Washington to delay projects in recent years. New York has used the section to delay pipelines that would bring natural gas to New England for example and Washington state has stopped coal export terminals that would open the Asian market for struggling coal companies in Wyoming and other landlocked western states. They are trying to make international environmental policy Wheeler said of Washington state whose governor Democrat Jay Inslee is running for president on a climate change focused platform. Theyre trying to dictate to the world how much coal is used. Wheeler said New York which amid strong public pressure denied a clean water act permit for construction of a natural gas pipeline to New England is forcing that region to use Russian produced natural gas. We are importing Russian natural gas which is not produced in an environmentally conscious manner. If the states that are blocking the pipelines were truly concerned about the environment they would look to where the natural gas would be coming from I think its very short sighted he said. Wheeler said the EPA would not prevent a state from vetoing a project but would clarify the parameters they should be able to consider and the length of time they have to do so. He also said that California is playing politics in its fight with the EPA to preserve its more stringent vehicle emission standards as the national standard. Wheeler said he believes climate change is a problem but that it had been overblown by former President Barack Obamas administration at the expense of other bigger issues like water quality. Yes climate is an issue and we are working to address it but I think water is a bigger issue he said. Wheeler dismissed the findings of a report released earlier this week by EPA scientists in the journal Nature Climate Change that detailed the scale and urgency of climate change. He said while he encouraged EPA scientists to carry out and publish research he stressed the recent paper did not reflect EPA policy. Environmental groups say the EPAs replacement of an Obama era rule limiting carbon emissions from power plants would likely lead to increased emissions by allowing older more polluting coal plants to operate longer. Asked whether the replacement the Affordable Clean Energy rule which gives states responsibility for regulating emissions is stringent enough Wheeler said it adheres to the parameters of federal law. I think what is effective regulation is one that follows the law and one that will be held up in court he said. Several Democrats challenging Trump in the 2020 election have made climate change a top tier issue embracing aggressive policy platforms like the Green New Deal calling for an end of fossil fuels use. Asked whether he was concerned that the EPA may be out of synch with polls showing an overwhelming number of young people believe climate change should be a priority issue Wheeler was dismissive. I do fear that because so many people only talked about climate change. Youre right there could very well be a new generation coming up saying thats the only environmental issue and its not he said.

In one of South Floridascongressional districts the party machine swept in to prop up a two term incumbent by painting his opponent as a puppet of fossil fuel interests and dirty coal money. The only catch? The incumbent is Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo and the party apparatus is the National Republican Congressional Committee whose coffers this cycle contain nearly 7 million in donations from the oil and gas industry. The ad was released on Oct. 30 and immediatelynational environmental groups that generally align with Democrats called foul underscoring their support of Curbelos Democratic challenger Debbie Mucarsel Powell. If Curbelo had been half the climate champion he claims he is he wouldnt be desperately seeking an ad littered with lies such as this said Sierra Club PAC Director Sarah Burton in a statement. But Curbelo isnt a climate champion hes a consistent vote against clean energy against our public lands and in favor of fossil fuels. Debbie Mucarsel Powell is a climate champion and the advocate South Floridians need as they watch sea levels rise see beaches destroyed by red tide and live with the increasing threat of stronger more powerful hurricanes. Curbelo has received more than 192000 from energy and natural resource firms in comparison tothe less than 5000 thatMucarsel Powellhas received from the same sector of donors according tothe Center for Responsive Politics. A spokesperson forMucarsel Powells campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Curbelo is one of thefounders of the Climate Solutions Caucus a bipartisangroup in Congress ostensibly committedto fighting global warming but restricted in practice by the reliance ofits 45 Republicanmembers on support from oil and gas firms. While he broke ranks this summer to express his support for a carbon tax as a possible way to combat climate change more than 30 of Curbelos Republican colleagues on the caucus supported a symbolic measure that disavowed a carbon tax. Last December he joined caucus members in a budget vote that would have openedup 1.5 million acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drillingMother Jonesreported at the time. The latest forecast from polling aggregatorFiveThirtyEighthas Curbelo trailing by less than one percentage point. The super PAC Climate Hawks Vote which supports candidates with a progressive energy agendahas been running ads against Curbelo that point to his history of receiving donations from fossil fuel companies including Chevron and Exxon Mobil.This cycle hisNo. 1 donorhas been NextEra Energy the Florida electric utility which is one of the largest purveyors of solar and wind energy projects in the country. We sure appreciate the help from the NRCC in calling out politicians who take dirty fossil fuel money and then obstruct progress on climate change and are looking forward to similar NRCC ads attacking every single one of their own candidates said RL Miller Climate Hawks Votes political director in a statement. We only wish the ad had noted how much Carlos Curbelo has taken from Big Oil.	False	False	False	False	False
Atlantic hurricane season has reached its peak and as Florida deals with devastation wrought by Irma RT takes a look at where the phenomena come from and if they are really becoming more frequent? The 2017 hurricane season has already seen Texas rocked by Harvey and Florida battered by Irma and there are concerns that Jose which is currently lashing the Caribbean could hit the US east coast. While September is the most active month for hurricanes worldwide the North Atlantic hurricane season is set to continue until November 30 raising the question where are these monster storms originating? READ MORE 4 dead as Hurricane Irma rocks Florida leaving 3.5mn without power PHOTOS VIDEOS Most of the major hurricanes that have impacted the US originated in Cape Verde a nation on a volcanic archipelago off the northwest coast of Africa according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA. The interaction between the hot dry air of the Sahara Desert and the cooler more humid air from the Gulf of Guinea below creates high altitude winds known as the African Easterly Jet. Blowing from east to west across Africa the winds form clusters of thunderstorms once the waves of air have enough moisture lift and instability. The storms typically form every two to three days in a region near Cape Verde but it is not until the period between summer and autumn that conditions become favorable for the development of tropical cyclones. Tropical waves of air interact with the warm equatorial water of the Atlantic as they head west prompting columns of warm moist air to rise from the ocean and create an ideal environment to develop into a full blown hurricane. However if the Saharan Air Layer commonly known as Saharan dust is in the vicinity at the time it can weaken tropical cyclones over the Atlantic. This very dry air is most likely to have an impact in July and early August Dr Gerry Bell a hurricane climate specialist with NOAA told RT.com. This is when atmospheric conditions are only marginally conducive if at all for tropical storm formation. Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Andrew began life as tropical waves off the coast of west Africa. Irma was first spotted as a tropical disturbance off the Cape Verde Islands in late August before becoming a hurricane over the Atlantic as it moved west. Cape Verde hurricanes are known for being particularly large and intense however not all hurricanes hitting the US originate here Harvey evolved from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean Sea. A 2015 study examining the relationship between West African tropical disturbances and Atlantic hurricanes found that the larger an area covered by the disturbances was the more likely it would develop into a hurricane only one to two weeks later. Is the US getting hit more frequently by hurricanes? Hurricane seasons have generally been longer since 1995 according to Bell which he says is consistent with a high activity era. The season lengths since 1995 are comparable to those during the last active era of the 1950s 1960s. A study published in Nature last year led by James Elsner a climate scientist and geographer at Florida State University found that while hurricanes were becoming more powerful they were also becoming less frequent. However there appears to be little consensus among scientific researchers. An early draft of the government publication the US Climate Science Special Report published by the New York Times notes an observed upward trend in North Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s. The NOAA Geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory meanwhile says it is too early to conclude that global warming has already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane or global tropical cyclone activity. However expects it to result in more intense tropical cyclones globally with substantially higher rainfall rates by the end of the 21st century. It notes however that there is little evidence to suggest that climate change will lead to a large increase in numbers of tropical storms or overall hurricanes in the Atlantic.

If We Bring The Good Life To All Will We Destroy The Planet? Our blog often features stories about efforts to improve life for this planet's 7 billion inhabitants How to make sure everyone has access to clean water and power medical care to stay healthy enough income to feed their kids education for the children so they can fulfill their potential. But a new study in the Journal Nature Sustainability poses a question not often considered If we were to succeed in providing all this what would be the cost to the environment? In other words can our planet actually sustain the good life for all? As we improve the human condition building sanitation facilities and expanding farming to provide more food for example we necessarily damage the environment. We cut down trees we put fertilizers in the soil that kill off aquatic life we pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. So to figure out if we can meet everyone's basic needs without destroying the planet we need to know For each bit of progress on the human front how much harm is done on the environmental side? To find out Daniel O'Neill an economist at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom and several collaborators came up with 11 indicators that a country has met the needs of its citizens. They range from boosting life expectancy above age 65 to ensuring that at least 95 percent of its adult population has graduated from high school has access to sanitation and earns more than the extreme poverty line of 1.90 a day. Then they looked at seven key ways in which humans damage the environment. For each of these scientists have calculated what degree of damage would put the planet at risk. In the case of carbon emissions for instance the threshold is the total amount that humanity can emit before we will cause the planet to warm enough to trigger catastrophic weather changes. From that we can calculate a carbon budget for the rest of the century notes O'Neill. And then dividing that by the number of people on the planet we can say 'okay this is the carbon budget per person.' Then they analyzed the data on 150 countries to determine how they scored on both the environmental and the social fronts. The hope was to find at least a few examples of countries that were simultaneously delivering the good life to their citizens while staying within their per capita boundaries for environmental damage in other words using natural resources at a rate that would be sustainable even if every person on the planet matched it. Unfortunately we really didn't find that says O'Neill. Instead says O'Neill generally the countries that do well on the social indicators do so by consuming resources at a level that could not be extended to all people on the planet. These include Germany the Netherlands and Austria. And the countries that do well on the environmental indicators in other words that are consuming resources at a sustainable level don't do well on the social indicators. Examples include Malawi Yemen and the Philippines. There are also five countries that do damage above all seven of the environmental boundaries even as they fail to achieve all 11 social indicators. This includes the United States which misses the mark when it comes to income equality and employment. China is arguably in even worse shape. It exceeds its per capita limits on five of the seven environmental thresholds yet only delivers on three of the social measures. Only one country comes even close to delivering the good life in a sustainable way Vietnam succeeds on six of social indicators including a life expectancy above 65 years and providing sufficient nutrition while staying within its limit on every environmental threshold except carbon emissions. What does this all mean for humanity? It's a worrying finding says O'Neill. But he cautions against concluding that there's simply no way for everyone to enjoy a decent life without destroying the planet. After all these findings are based on how we are doing things now he says. We certainly hope it's possible to do things better to achieve a high level of human well being at a much lower level of resource use. And he adds that this study actually points to one way to do that. Specifically O'Neill and his fellow researchers ran statistical tests to determine for each environmental measure how much damage it takes to produce a corresponding improvement on each of the social well being indicators. And what we find is that it follows a curve of diminishing returns as you use more resources you get less social bang for your buck says O'Neill. So there's a turning point after which additional resource use contributes very little to social performance. Wealthy industrialized nations such as the United States the United Kingdom and Canada have now reached that point says O'Neill. As we increase our resource use we get almost no increase in human well being from that. And this means the strategy of growing the economy basically trying to create new wealth to boost the well being of its underprivileged citizens is ineffective. A much better approach argues O'Neill would be to focus on redistributing the wealth we already have more equitably. And if high income countries were to adapt such a philosophy says O'Neill they could reduce their use of resources. And that he says would free up the ecological space for poor nations for whom using resources still does make a big impact in improving people's lives.	False	False	False	False	False
William Happer the White Houses most veteran climate change denier who tried unsuccessfully to establish an ad hoc panel to challenge near universally accepted climate science is leaving the Trump administration according to reports from EE Newsand Bloomberg. A retired Princeton physics professor with no expertise in climatology Happer has served as President Donald Trumps deputy assistant for emerging technologies on the National Security Council since September 2018. He has long argued that the planet and humans benefit from increased carbon dioxide emissions. He has called climate science a cult claimed Earth is in the midst of a CO2 famine and said the demonization of carbon dioxide isjust like the demonization of the poor Jewsunder Hitler. Earlier this year TrumptappedHapper to lead a panel of fringe researchers tasked specifically with conducting adversarial scientific peer review of climate science part of the administrations relentless effort to discredit and downplay the ongoing crisis. The White House ultimately scrapped the plan as EE News reported in July. News of Happers departure comes one day after the resignation of his boss national security adviser John Bolton. It was Bolton who recruited Happer to the National Security Council and backed his effort to create an anti science panel according to The New York Times. The CO2 Coalition a right wing think tank that Happer co founded and that argues Earth benefits from humans pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere confirmedhis upcoming resignation in a Tuesday post to its website and praised him for his efforts. While your proposed review of alarmist analyses and projections has been delayed we believe your work in calling attention to the problem of unscientific climate alarmism has reduced the chances of the dramatic increases in energy prices that would arise from the banning of fossil fuels that some have proposed Patrick Moore and Caleb Rossiter two representatives of the CO2 Coalition wrote in a joint statement. The CO2 Coalition is one of several think tanks that peddle misinformation about climate change and receive funding from the Mercer familythe billionaire megadonors whogave more than 15 million to Trumps 2016 campaign.

Democrats vying for president revealed a fundamental split over how aggressively the US should tackle climate change in a seven hour town hall meeting on Wednesday. Bernie Sanders painted an apocalyptic future wreaked by the climate crisis and pledged to wage war on the fossil fuel industry. A high energy Elizabeth Warren urged optimism for building a better America and the former vice president Joe Biden who has a pitched a more moderate proposal said he would push other nations to recommit to stronger action. Sanders said without radical change the world will be uninhabitable. The damage to the world will be irreparable the Vermont senator said adding that he is proposing the largest most comprehensive climate plan presented by any presidential candidate in the history of the United States. With many questions focused on what candidates would ask Americans to sacrifice Elizabeth Warren pushed back on the framing. Asked if the government should tell people what kind of lightbulbs they can have the Massachusetts senator quipped Oh come on give me a break! There are a lot of ways that we try to change our energy consumption and our pollution she said. Some of it is with lightbulbs some of it is on straws some of it dang is on cheeseburgers. But most of the responsibility lies with industry not individuals she said adding this is exactly what the fossil fuel industry wants us to talk about. Biden meanwhile pitched himself as the candidate who could lead negotiations with the diplomatic might of the US. He said his first step as president would be to call an international meeting to strengthen the Paris climate agreement. We should be organizing the world demanding change we need a diplomat in chief Biden said. Look whats happening now in the Amazon whats going on? Nothing. Biden who critics say has one of the less progressive climate plans also got grilled on his plans to attend a fundraiser hosted by the founder of a natural gas company. He claimed the supporter is not a corporate executive. Where Biden would invest 1.7tn to fight climate change Warren proposed 10tn and Sanders would put forward 16.3tn setting them widely apart. The Democrats faced questions on whether their proposals would ban fracking for natural gas prohibit exports of oil gas and coal change nutritional guidelines to limit meat consumption and transition to all electric vehicles. Their answers and reactions to them foreshadowed the fight ahead with conservatives and industry regardless of who becomes the next president. Donald Trump in a thread on Twitter charged that Democrat plans will raise your energy bill and prices at the pump. The fossil fuels industry through the oil trade group the American Petroleum Institute and the American Energy Alliance said the plans would hurt poor Americans. Tonight while American families worry about making ends meet the Democrats running for president will be working hard to outbid each other on who can raise electricity and gasoline prices the highest and the fastest the alliance said in an emailed statement. The event was perhaps the longest stretch of primetime television ever dedicated to climate change held after the Democratic National Committee refused to sanction an official climate debate between candidates and amid unprecedented pressure from young activists and the Democratic voting base to tackle the climate crisis. On Wednesday a list of demands was released by a coalition of youth led groups whose lodestar is Greta Thunberg the Swedish teenager and activist who sparked a global wave of walkouts by school students over the climate crisis. Thunberg arrived in New York last week after crossing the Atlantic in a solar powered yacht for an upcoming UN climate summit. According to Yale University polling the climate emergency is now the second most important voting issue for Democrats behind healthcare. Among all voting Americans nearly seven in 10 are worried about climate change the highest ever recorded level of concern. There are strong bipartisan majorities in favour of setting pollution limits on industry businesses cars and trucks. Donald Trump who is dismantling rules aimed at lowering planet warming gases attacked the Democratic candidates for proposing unrealistic costly plans. The Democrats destructive environmental proposals will raise your energy bill and prices at the pump the president wrote on Twitter. Dont the Democrats care about fighting American poverty? Trumps campaign quickly took the opportunity to post a clip of California senator Kamala Harris saying she would ban plastic straws alongside an ad for Trump branded straws. But some young conservatives have raised concerns that Republican intransigence over the climate crisis will cost the party a generation of voters. Recent Newsy Ipsos polling found that 59 of millennial and Generation Z Republicans support the Green New Deal. There are a lot of young people who are conservative and believe in climate change They will not vote for a Republican if theyre voting on this issue said Benjamin Backer founder of the American Conservation Coalition which proposes action on the climate crisis. And I think thats a problem with the lack of involvement from the Republican Party on this issue for the past 10 years.	False	False	False	False	False
Trump speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday after touring damage from Hurricane Irma on Florida's west coast said we've had bigger storms than this when asked about climate change. If you go back into the 1930s and the 1940s and you take a look we've had storms over the years that have been bigger than this Trump said. If you go back into the teens you'll see storms that were as big or bigger. So we did have two horrific storms epic storms but if you go back into the '30s and '40s and you go back into the teens you'll see storms that were very similar and even bigger OK? In response to this story a White House aide pointed CNN to a recent NOAA report that found that it is premature to conclude that human activities ... have already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane or global tropical cyclone activity. That same report however found that human activity may have already caused changes and that global warming will likely cause tropical cyclones globally to be more intense on average and lead to an increase in the occurrence of very intense tropical cyclones. Trump campaigned on a platform that rejected much of the scientific community's findings on climate change arguing that the Obama administration used climate science too often to restrict business growth. Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate accords earlier this year and had previously had called climate change a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. Trump's comments Thursday go against the hyperbolic language he used in the lead up and aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma. Hurricane Irma is of epic proportion perhaps bigger than we have ever seen Trump tweeted as Irma moved closer to Florida. Earlier this month he tweeted Hurricane looks like largest ever recorded in the Atlantic! And on Thursday in Florida before his comments aboard Air Force One about climate change Trump said the people of Florida experienced something the likes of which we can say really say nobody's ever seen before. They've never seen a category like this come in because it came in really at a five he said. Top Trump administration officials have repeatedly dodged questions about how climate change affected the damage done by hurricanes Harvey and Irma saying the issue should be discussed at a later date. said last week it was insensitive to address global warming at this time. said last week it was insensitive to address global warming at this time. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said last week it was insensitive to address global warming at this time. Mick Mulvaney the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget told CNN that climate change is a longer discussion on another day and a big topic for the media. And both FEMA administrator Brock Long and acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke avoided explicitly answering when asked Tuesday whether the government needs to be more focused on climate change because of the storms. Trump's visit to tour hurricane damage on Thursday was his second trip in as many weeks. Trump toured the Houston area earlier this month after Hurricane Harvey brought massive flooding to the city. The storm and subsequent damage could end up being the costliest natural disaster in US history.	False	False	False	False	False
Its true that not all the sea ice is gone yet but much of what remains is thin enough that the light passing through it is allowing algae blooms. In many places it is cracked and subject to being broken up by storms which due to the extremes of heat and cold confronting eachother in that region have extremes of wind and wave. The Jacobshaven Glacier delivering 10 of the ice melt from Greenlands ice caps to the sea no longer flows at a glacial pace but rather is retreating at 10 kmyr with the rate of retreat increasing at an increasing rate just as with the sea ice. Instead of climate changing over millennia we are now seeing it change in ways we can observe with our own eyes in the course of a season. Even as some scientists are still looking at what happened during the second half of the 20th century at a scale of change over decades others are beginning to address the significant acceleration of changes observed year by year. A link to a number of papers since 2015 showing dramatic climate change globally and in particular with extremes at the poles is still controversial to some. Dramatic climate change is affecting both the Arctic and West Antarctica yet the relative roles of local versus remote forcings in causing the changes are being debated. As global climate change continues to unfold the two way links between the tropics and the poles will play key determining factors in the climatic evolution of these sensitive regions. Thus the time is ripe for a detailed look at how the tropics and the poles are coupled climatically. This special collection of the Journal of Climate on Connecting the Tropics to Polar Regions grew out of a mini conference on the same topic that was held at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory in June 2014 ConferenceWeb.html Removal of the sea ice from over the ESAS allows storms to churn up the bottom sediments speeding the release of Methane. Methane releases speed up the melting of the permafrost. The permafrost stores huge amounts of methane and fresh water. We have known this since 2007. A policy briefing from the Woods Hole Research Center concludes that the IPCC doesnt adequately account for a methane warming feedback While most attention has been given to carbon dioxide it isnt the only greenhouse gas that scientists are worried about. Carbon dioxide is the most important human emitted greenhouse gas but methane has also increased in the atmosphere and it adds to our concerns. As the Earth warms and the Arctic warms especially fast the permafrost melts and soil decomposition accelerates. Consequently an initial warming leads to more emission leading to more warming and more emission. It is a vicious cycle and there may be a tipping point where this self reinforcing cycle takes over. Recently a policy briefing from the world leading Woods Hole Research Center has moved our understanding of this risk further through a clearly written summary. The briefing cites two recent papers here and here that study the so called permafrost carbon feedback. One of these studies makes use of projections from the most recent IPCC report to estimate that up to 205 gigatons equivalent of carbon dioxide could be released due to melting permafrost. This would cause up to 0.5C up to 0.9F extra warming. Arctic scientists warn that the release of the methane from the ESAS could happen with the same surprising acceleration we see with glaciers sea ice and the polar ice caps melting and have a huge effect on the melt rate of the permafrost. Just as bad the permafrost melting would continue after 2100 which would lock us into even more warming. Under this scenario meeting a 2C limit would be harder than anticipated. The current IPCC targets do not adequately account for this feedback. This is essentially what arctic scientists have been warning about for a decade now but pointing out that the time scale is no longer centuries but just years and this is another reason why the IPCC is moving up their next report date	False	False	False	False	False
The U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA is actively trying to muzzle and minimize scientific reports warning about the impacts of climate change according to a Monday Politico report. The research Trump officials are trying to keep hidden could help farmers deal with the impact of climate change such as how climate change affects the protein in wheat fed to cattle or how changes in carbon dioxide levels alters the nutrients in rice. But rather than promote such peer reviewed research by the USDA's Agricultural Research Service ARS the agency refuses to even issue press releases. In one instance about research on rice the agency tried to dissuade a research partner the University of Washington from publicly discussing research. It was so unusual to have an agency basically say 'Don't do a press release' Jeff Hodson a communications director at the university told Politico. We stand for spreading the word about the science we do especially when it has a potential impact on millions and millions of people. Research from Politico showed the USDA did not attempt any promotion or press releases for 45 ARS studies that mentioned climate change. The intent is to try to suppress a message in this case the increasing danger of human caused climate change said Michael Mann a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. Who loses out? The people who are already suffering the impacts of sea level rise and unprecedented super storms droughts wildfires and heat waves. Anti science censorship has become a hallmark of the Trump administration. In August 2018 a survey of 63000 government scientists warned that censorship has been a problem in the Trump administration from the beginning. When a multi agency report on climate change was released in November 2018 Trump's EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler complained that it had too much science in it. As recently as June the Trump administration prevented a scientist from writing about climate change in testimony before Congress because it didn't jibe with the administration's view on the topic. Trump has been clear that he does not believe in the sound science behind climate change writing it off as a hoax. Trump said he didn't believe the multi agency scientific report about climate change noted above. Trump has also chosen fellow climate change skeptics for the highest levels of his administration including Sonny Perdue who leads the Department of Agriculture. In May career government economists accused Perdue and his agency of retaliating against them for their reports showing that Trump's tax and farm subsidy policies are hurting the very rural voters he promised to help. Now farmers may also feel the brunt of the pain from not receiving information about how to cope with the changing environment. Perdue refused to comment on this latest report that his agency is suppressing scientific research. If you're taking a certain block of research and not communicating it it defeats the purpose of why USDA does the research in the first place Robert Bonnie who worked at USDA during President Obama's administration told Politico.

What is the goal of a funeral? Is it to pay tribute to a life lost? To commit the soul of the decedent to his final reward? Or an opportunity to extolyour passion for environmental justice? A recent Vox piece by Dean Peterson states with dogged solemnity that modern burials are awful for the environment and has an accompanying video whose combination of animation the veneer of open mindedness and a vocally inflective narrator discreetly blurs the line between providing information and outright advocacy. Its yet another instance of the environmentally conscious Left virtue signaling about the negative effects of nearly everything human beings do Not even the way we mourn our dead is safe from their parade of moral superiority. The piece and video discuss the environmental effects of American funerals with their caskets embalming fluid and grave sites. The piece claims the average burial costs up to 12000 though the National Funeral Directors Associations most recent report indicated average costs almost 3500 less than that. Either way thats a lot of money of course but the point is not to expiate upon the market forces driving prices in the funeral industry. What is most remarkable is the pieces bizarre stance on this debate Petersons primary concern appears to be getting rid of Grandma with as small of a carbon footprint as possible rather than reverence intergenerational remembrance or even concern for the grieving. We all hold a hierarchy of values. For most people of good conscience the value of a human beings life supersedes that of our dog or a backyard plant. We make decisions every day accordingly. We routinely delay temporal pleasure for example in the hopes of attaining goals we hold in higher esteem such as when we diet exercise or volunteer. Each individual has values good and bad and they often remain in tension with one another. It is after all the measure of ones moral fitness to value some things say forgiveness over others vengeance. What makes radical environmentalism and its private jet flying propagators so toxic a cultural beast is how high on its adherents totem pole they are willing to place environmental concerns often over some of the most elemental human needs and desires. The wish to have additional children for example is a cause for deep apprehension among environmentalists who seem all at once indifferent and tone deaf to how out of touch such a sentiment is. In this Vox piece it appears that some environmentalists have shifted focused to the other side of lifes journey death and more specifically how we bury our loved ones. For most normal people funerary concerns are primarily about memorializing the deceased within the reasonable bounds of ones budget. Petersons video notes that in this strange race to the environmental bottom some advocates believe burying Aunt Lisa in a casket is an alarming degradation of the environment some might even want her tossed straight into the ground. Maybe he suggests readers could consider freezing their bodies with liquid nitrogen or having their ashes turned into a coral reef. Its an odd calculus at play in the authors mind where the ultimate barometer of a funerals efficacy is its environmental impact statement. Its totally legitimate to criticize modern burials on its face the piece seems a cogent critique of excesses in the funeral industry. But what is particularly troubling about Voxs article is its larger point that we as humans must give perpetual deference to some vague conception of environmentalism at most any cost. As the oft repeated refrain goes is environmentalist hysteria the inevitable fate of a society that ceases to believe in God? When organized religion fades and its would be adherents are left to search for meaning does the god of the environment end their search for a moral authority? Pardon the extended biblical analogy but Voxs piece sounds more than a bit like Judas Iscariots laments about the funeral rituals performed on Christ. When Mary Magdalene anoints Christ with perfumes and oil as a pre burial ritual on a night leading up to His execution a livid Judas berates her gesture protesting that the money used to buy the perfume could have been spent on the poor. Johns Gospel provides the relevant addendum He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief as keeper of the money bag he used to help himself to what was put into it. That statement not only describes Judass moral disorder but also reminds the audience that any concern holy as it may be poverty reduction environmental protection or any other earthly mission that does not give a preferential deference to God His creation and acts of beauty such as that of Mary Magdalene are sure signs of misaligned priorities. This piece from Vox forces us to ask the question At what point does genuine concern for the environment turn into a power grab so vicious that one would rather soak Grandpa in liquid nitrogen than give him a proper burial?

Two Republican House members have signed their name onto bipartisan carbon tax legislation a bill that stands virtually zero chance of passing during the lame duck session. GOP Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Francis Rooney of Florida are to introduce a carbon tax bill on Tuesday alongside Florida Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch.TheEnergy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act if passed would slap a 15 per metric ton carbon fee on fossil fuel industries. While the bill has little chance of passing it is intended to spark a debate over carbon pricing as the Democratic Party prepares to take over the lower chamber of Congress. More than a dozen federal agencies just warned us that if we dont take dramatic action climate change will knock 10 percent off of our GDP by the end of this century Deutch the bills Democratic co sponsorstated to Bloomberg Environment. Putting a price on carbon can help change the behavior of polluters. We hope our bipartisan bill will spur action on climate change before its too late. That 15 per metric ton fee would increase by 10 every year until reaching certain carbon emission targets. In order to shield citizens from higher fossil fuel prices revenue from the tax would be given back out to households.Sponsors of the legislation believe it would slash greenhouse gas emissions by one third over a 10 year period and a 90 percent cut by 2050 compared to 2015 emission levels. TheEnergy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is notable in that itsthe first bipartisan carbon tax bill introduced in Congress in about 10 years. However given the GOP will control the Senate and White House for at least the next two years its passage appears quite bleak. The bill comes not long after an outgoing Republican lawmaker Rep. Carlos Curbelo introduced a carbon tax bill of his own this year. Cureblos bill was more stringent calling for a24 per ton fee on carbon. Much like the new bipartisan bill Curbelos was doomed to fail from the beginning and he endured attack ads from the right for even introducing it. Long considered one of the most at risk Republicans heading into Election Day Curbelo went on to lose his Miami area House seat to a Democratic challenger. Curbelo was one among many moderate Republicans on the Climate Solutions Caucus who lost re election. Altogether 13 GOP members of the bipartisan climate group lost their elections and numerous others chose to retire. RELATED A Growing Number Of Democrats Are Signing On To Ocasio Cortezs Green New Deal Republicans Fitzpatrick and Rooney both members of the Climate Solutions Caucus survived their re elections and both will continue to work with Democrats on various climate change bills in the next legislative session.

At least eighteen environmental groups filed four lawsuits in one day against the Trump administration including suits to keep in place Obama era environmental policies. Environmentalists filed their suit Wednesday. Theyare living up to threats made after President Donald Trump took office namely to use the courts to preserve Obama administration policies. These include orders that stop offshore drilling and force the closure of coal plants. The League of Conservation Voters LCV led eight other groups in a legal challengeof Trumps recent executive order to reopen large swaths of Arctic seas to offshore drilling.LCV is one of the many environmental groups that endorsed Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election. Never in LCVs history have we taken this step Gene Karpinski LCVs president said in a statement. The permanent protections President Obama established for the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans were won with years of research lobbying and organizing. The suit argues Obama used his authority Section 12a of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to put most Arctic waters off limits to development. The act does not allow future presidents to undo placing waters off limits activists argue. The same day Earthjustice and the Center for Biological Diversity CBD filed suits to challenge the administration. Earthjustice sued to stop the Environmental Protection Agencys EPA decision to indefinitely stay the implementation of wastewater discharge rules for coal plants. CBD filed suit against EPA for not finalizing deadlines for the cities of Washington D.C. and Philadelphia to meet ozone standards. CBD also sued for Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitts emails and schedule. Earthjustice and CBD joined LCVs suit against Trumps EPA. So far CBD has filed 15 lawsuits against the administration something which the activist group publicly brags about. CBD famously sued the Department of Homeland Security DHS to stop the construction of a wall on the U.S. Mexico border. CBD wants the court to force DHS to conduct a programmatic environmental impact statement on border enforcement operations. Trump can expect more lawsuits as he continues to rollback Obama era policies. Environmentalists spent years lobbying and campaigning to get such policies in place. The Natural Resources Defense Council NRDC for example played a pivotal role in crafting the Clean Power Plan which became Obamas signature global warming policy. But Trump ordered EPA to review the Clean Power Plan asking the agency to see if it needed to be modified or rescinded. NRDC and other environmental groups were already locked in legal battles to keep the power plant rule from being overturned. NRDC has filed its fair share of lawsuits against Trump as well. They filed two lawsuits against the administration in February to keep the EPA from withdrawing a mercury rule and to oppose an executive order requiring agencies to repeal two regulations for every new one imposed. In March NRDC and other environmentalists sued to block the Keystone XL oil pipeline from being built. Theyalso tried to intervene in a lawsuit against a national ocean monument Obama created. The group filed at least two lawsuits in April challenging Trumps delaying energy efficiency standards for appliances and the administrations refusal to ban certain pesticides. NRDC attorneys are also representing LCV and others in the suit to keep Arctic waters off limits to drilling. Were President Trump able to get away with this the country would lose an important tool for protecting its vital interest in clean and vibrant oceans and coasts Niel Lawrence NRDCs Alaska director told Bloomberg. By now its clear there is no legitimate public interest in further expanding risk to our oceans in pursuit of fossil fuels that we dont need Lawrence said.

Before I address that question I just stumbled upon an article in the August 1 Washington Post. There the Post updated its truth squad totals on Donald Trump 4229 false and misleading statements in 558 days. I then reflected upon Anderson Coopers infamous April 17 2018 CNN interview of Jim Jordan. In that interview a fumbling Jordan firmly insisted to Coopers amazement that he never heard Trump lie. This is the same Jim Jordan who less than three months later saw no evil and heard no evil in the Ohio State sex scandal that victimized some of Jordans former wrestling students. I wondered to myself how Jordans credibility would hold up when cross examined in court on this issue now that these incredible statements are in the public domain. No wonder Trump loves Jordan! Every word Trump speaks is the Truth in Jordans world. Sure Jordans a politician and all politicians lie at some time or anothersee Adams . But its quite another thing when you live your entire Congressional career as one big liea lie that causes long term harm not only to the folks living in your district but the country as a whole. Nowhere is that lie more obvious than in Jim Jordans approach to global warming and general environmental issues. And heres why Jordan will live on in villainy. In July 2008 after being in Congress for a year and a half Jim Jordan was the first member of Congress to sign the No Climate Tax Pledge. Yes the first to sign his initial salvo in an unrelenting fight he wages against our planet. The pledge or vow is the product of Americans for Prosperity the conservative political advocacy group funded by David and Charles Koch. This is the outfit that went to war with the Obama Administration initiatives to combat global warming. The promise itself is significant for a couple of reasons 1 it opposes any legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in government revenue 2 it drives the final nail in the coffin of environmental bipartisanship which had been the norm for decades. Lets take a closer look at this. First 71 of Americans now think that most scientists believe global warming is occurring 68 of Americans believe global warming is caused by human activities. March 14 2017 Gallup poll. Record percentages of Americans are now concerned about global warming. I would predict the same percentages of belief would apply to Jordans Ohio 4th Congressional District plus or minus a few points. But Jordan wanted to be the first congressman in the USA to sell out the voters of a congressional districtnever mind it had to be his own. He couldnt wait to curry favor with the Koch boys and sign on the dotted line. What hes really saying is Regardless how bad it gets how severe the droughts how out of control the forest fires how strong the tornadoes and hurricanes how hot the summers how cold the winters how deep the floods how devastating the blizzards how much the ice caps melt how high the oceans rise I will not vote to tax tariff or otherwise increase revenues to cap the use of fossil fuels unless that money is cut or borrowed from somewhere else in the budget. And in Jordans case that would be Social Security Medicare education health care and the like Programs that benefit folks in his district. So from that July day in 2008 Jordan waged his own war on the environment Voting to bar greenhouse gasses from Clean Air Act rules voting against enforcing limits on carbon dioxide global warming pollution against tax incentives for renewable electricity and energy conservation against curtailing subsidies for oil and gas company exploration but voting in favor of opening the Outer Continental Shelf to oil drilling. The League of Conservation Voters National Environmental Scorecard awarded Jordan a perfect 0 score for his 2017 record and a lifetime score of 4 for his work. The saddest part of this story however is the depth weve descended into the abyss of partisanship on environmental issues. These were matters that we have historically agreed on if for no other reason than the sake of our children and grandchildrens future. For example in 1969 Congress passed the landmark National Environmental Policy Act NEPA. This revolutionary piece of legislation unanimously passed the Senate the vote in the House was 372 Years with only 15 Nays. Nixon signed it into law on New Year's Day 1970. Now thanks to guys like Jordan NEPA would not even be brought to the floor for a vote if it were introduced in todays Congress. In contrast Janet Garrett by philosophy an environmentalist will push for and support an agenda that will guarantee clean water clean air and the reduction of greenhouse gasses. Garrett knows the value of Environmental Protection on those who knowingly violate our statutes Janet will push for criminal enforcement. Garrett will defend our National Park system and public lands as she understands the need to preserve the earth for her children and grandchildren. To Janet this is a moral issue. Please support Janet Garrett in her efforts to replace Jordan in Congress.	False	False	False	False	False
Incoming New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez brings with her a massive online following influence she says shell deploy only in support of candidates and politicians who support her plan for a Green New Deal. The Green New Deal is something Ocasio Cortez invokes frequently in media appearances and rallies. So whats actually in it? Her office recently released the text of a proposed House rules change outlining the plan. The proposed rule change for the upcoming 116th Congress would require the creation of a Select Committee for a Green Deal that would be responsible for creating the plan by January 1 2020 with corresponding draft legislation soon after. The text of the rule change lays out the committees jurisdiction and required areas of action. Its scope and mandate for legislative authority amounts to a radical grant of power to Washington over Americans lives homes businesses travel banking and more. Early on under Jurisdiction the document makes clear its grandiose philosophical vision The select committee shall have authority to develop a detailed national industrial economic mobilization plan for the transition of the United States economy to become greenhouse gas emissions neutral and to significantly draw down greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and oceans and to promote economic and environmental justice and equality. In addition to achieving its goal of meeting 100 of national power demand through renewable sources the document also repeatedly states the Green New Deal will advance non environmental projects such as social economic racial regional and gender based justice. Ocasio Cortezs plan further claims it will virtually eliminate poverty The Plan for a Green New Deal and the draft legislation shall recognize that a national industrial economic mobilization of this scope and scale is a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States and to make prosperity wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation. More specifically Ocasio Cortezs plan calls for within 10 years a series of lofty overhauls of American life emphasis added Between its calls for upgrading homes and overhauling travel public infrastructure and even the way Americans consume electricity the plan leaves virtually no facet of everyday life untouched. Think of how often you dont use electricity to imagine how much of your average day the plan wouldntimpact. The proposed committee would also have seemingly total oversight of American industry with a mandate for pushing union membership. Under Scope of the Plan a section on labor states the committees final plan shall Require strong enforcement of labor workplace safety and wage standards that recognize the rights of workers to organize and unionize free of coercion intimidation and harassment and creation of meaningful quality career employment. Later in the document Ocasio Cortezs plan imagines creating a national jobs force to help people participate in this transition. The Green New Deal it says shall provide all members of our society across all regions and all communities the opportunity training and education to be a full and equal participant in the transition including through a job guarantee program to assure a living wage job to every person who wants one. The plan also imagines creating governmental support for transitioning minority communities. The deal shall ensure a just transition for all workers low income communities communities of color indigenous communities rural and urban communities and the front line communities most affected by climate change pollution and other environmental harm including by ensuring that local implementation of the transition is led from the community level. More Ocasio Cortez sees this plan is being a vehicle through which social equality might finally realized through theuse of reparations to right historicalinjustices. The final Green New Deal willmitigate deeply entrenched racial regional and gender based inequalities in income and wealth including without limitation ensuring that federal and other investment will be equitably distributed to historically impoverished low income deindustrialized or other marginalized communities in such a way that builds wealth and ownership at the community level. And if that werent enough to ensure that Democratic Socialism could be fully realized in America the plan includes failsafe in the form of universal income and Medicarefor All The plan it says shall include additional measures such as basic income programs universal health care programs and any others as the select committee may deem appropriate to promote economic security labor market flexibility and entrepreneurism. Ocasio Cortez clarifies that this plan would not only need to be financed by taxpayers but also the Federal Reserve and other institutions the government can create. The end of the document contains a QA one of which deals with the plans funding The Federal Reserve can extend credit to power these projects and investments new public banks can be created as in WWII to extend credit and a combination of various taxation tools including taxes on carbon and other emissions and progressive wealth taxes can be employed. Ocasio Cortez may not be in Congress yet but she already has a plan to remake the way Americans drive commute live work and even use the financial system. Let there be little doubt how she aspires to wield power in Washington. Editors Note This post has been updated with grammatical fixes.	False	False	False	False	False
In the next few weeksCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom is slated to announce his administrations energy policy strategy and many environmental groups thereare hopingit will include plans to end oil and gas drilling in the nations most populous state and phase out all fossil fuel extraction. At the very least green groups are hoping that Newsom who campaigned last year on a promise to end controversial extraction methods like fracking and who has been a key figure in the fight to curtail climate change will create buffer zones for any new oil and gas wells near schools hospitals and residential neighborhoods and also monitor for dangerous emissions from plugged or abandoned wells. I consider to remain optimistic given how he expressed interest in issues that former California Gov. Jerry Brown did not address Kathryn Phillips the director of the Sierra Club California told Fox News. The governor needs to make a plan to transition the state away from oil and gas toward renewables but also transition workers into jobs in that sector. But as Newsoms term in Sacramento approaches its fifth month many of these groups are losing patience as the governor tries to balance a clean energy agenda with the demands of an industry that supports hundreds of thousands of jobs in a state with around 26 million vehicles on the road. Im taking a very pragmatic look at it in scoping this Newsom told The Los Angeles Times recently. Its also an inclusive scoping because it includes people in the industry that have jobs communities that are impacted from an environmental justice prism but also from an economic justice prism. Its a challenging issue. Newsom must now weigh the support he received from environmental groups while on the campaign trail and his own assurances that he wants California to be powered 100 percent by renewable energy in the near future with any moves that could negatively affect a billion dollar industry in a state that has the worlds fifth largest economy. Even with Californias oil production being in decline for years the state was the nations fifth largest domestic crude oil producerin 2017 according to figures compiled by the federal government. His intentions are very pragmatic Catherine Reheis Boyd the president of the Western States Petroleum Association told Fox News. Newsomunderstands the importance of an industry to the 40 million people who will be driving 26 million combustible engines tomorrow. One practice that environmental groups are hoping Newsom will clamp down on more than his predecessor is hydraulic fracturing. Known more popularly as fracking it is a method of oil and gas extraction in which large volumes of high pressure water are shot into the ground. Fracking has come under intense scrutiny in recent years amid widespread concerns over both the public health and environmental risks it poses. While Brown approved restrictions on the practice back in 2013 he was lambasted by green groups for not banning fracking outright amid his argument that it could provide economic opportunities to some Californians. On the campaign trail last year Newsom was adamantly opposed to fracking but has so far remained quiet about the practice along with the possibility of banning offshore drilling in the state when discussing his energy agenda. Newsom however told the Los Angeles Times that despite his commitment to renewable energies it would be impossible to completely stop Californias reliance on fossil fuels at the moment. One cannot just turn off the switch. One cannot just immediately abut against a century of practice and policy Newsom said. Still California is one of the nations leaders in pushing forth a green energy agenda. Despite the criticism leveled against him for waffling on clamping down on the fossil fuel industry Brown last year signed two pieces of legislation that effectively banned the construction of any new offshore oil and gas pipelines in the states waters and thwarted a Trump administration plan to open nearly 1.7 billion acres of coastal waters to drilling. While California cannot directly block oil and gas drilling off its coast the legislation that Brown signed aims to drive up the operating costs of these operations enough to make the effort unprofitable. Thelaw does this by blocking state land managers from permitting the construction of new pipelines piers wharves or other infrastructure projects necessary to bring oil and gas from offshore drilling sites to land. California has positioned itself as the center of the Trump resistance Jessica Levinson a clinical law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles told Fox News. Its bloody combat. California banned offshore drilling in state waters out to three miles back in 1994 and there havent been any new platforms built in the last 30 years. But California is the nations third largest oil producing state behind Texas and North Dakota and there are still 32 offshore oil platforms and artificial islands in federal and state waters off the coasts of Santa Barbara Ventura Los Angeles and Orange Counties. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP California may be leading the nation in curbing its reliance on fossil fuels and many environmental activists believe Newsom will take even bolder steps than his predecessor energy industry insiders like Reheis Boyd question what the point is when other states and nations are not doing their part as well. I get the idea of taking a lead on this issue and I think many companies agree with this she said. But at what cost is this being done especially when nobody else is doing anything.

The Amazon is burning at an alarming rate in Brazil with 72843 fires detected so far this year by the countrys space research center INPE. That amounts to an 83 percent increase over the same period in 2018 and the highest number since the agency started recording fires in 2013 meaning it is likely the highest number of fires to date. The sudden spike has prompted renewed concern that the destruction of the Amazon basin is the result of right wing President Jair Bolsonaros environmental policies that dont give much thought to the environment at all. The smoke from the fires has been so bad that when carried by the wind it caused an hourlong blackout in nearby So Paulo. The right wing populist Bolsonaro who has shown disdain for protecting the Amazonhome to 3 million species of plants and animals and 1 million or so peoplecame to power in January. The Bolsonaro regime has reversed previous governments efforts to enforce environmental regulations and protect what is the largest rainforest in the world. Over the past decade previous governments had managed to reduce deforestation with action by federal agencies and a system of fines. But Mr Bolsonaro and his ministers have criticised the penalties and overseen a fall in confiscations of timber and convictions for environmental crimes the BBC reports. Last monththe far right president accused Inpes director of lying about the scale of deforestationin the Amazon and trying to undermine the government. It came after Inpe published data showing an 88 percent increase in deforestation there in June compared to the same month a year ago. Conversely NASA has reported overall fire activity in the Amazon basin has been slightly below average. Since Thursday INPE said satellite images spotted 9507 new forest fires in the country mostly in the Amazon basin home to the worlds largest tropical forest seen as vital to countering global warming Reuters reports. Wildfires have increased in Mato Grosso and Para two states where Brazils agricultural frontier has pushed into the Amazon basin and spurred deforestation. Wildfires are common in the dry season but are also deliberately set by farmers illegally deforesting land for cattle ranching. Bolsonaro dismissed alarm over the latest data saying it was simply the season that farmers use open fires to clear farmland. I used to be called Captain Chainsaw. Now I am Nero setting the Amazon aflame he said.	False	False	False	False	False
Accompanying every hurricane are numerous stories in mainstream media outlets suggesting disaster could have been averted had American elected officials done more to stop global warming which left wing pundits continue to insist is almost entirely being caused by humans carbon dioxide CO2 emissions. In article after article pundits have claimed Republicans especially President Donald Trump are in some way responsible for Hurricane Florence. The Washington Posts editorial board in an article titled Yes you can blame President Trump for Hurricane Florence even went so far as to say Trump was complicit for the storm. This is total nonsense. Not only are there countless good reasons to question the extent to which humans are contributing to global warming theres no evidence indicating hurricanes have become significantly worse as a result of global warming. As Roy Spencer Ph.D. an acclaimed climate scientist who previously worked for NASA recently stated The fact that there has been no long term change in global hurricane activity and even a 50 percent decrease in U.S. landfalling major hurricanes over the last 80 years means no one is complicit in these storms. James Agresti the president of the Just Facts think tank rightly notes data appearing in the academic journal Geophysical Research Letters show the global number and intensity of cyclones hurricanes and major hurricanes have been roughly level for the past four to five decades. Some have said Florence was made worse because of warmer ocean waters caused by climate change but thats also false. Writing for Climate Change Dispatch Michael Bastasch explains An analysis of Florences path by Cato Institute meteorologist Ryan Maue showed ocean temperatures were abnormally cool for most of the storms trek through the Atlantic Ocean. Even the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change one of the most notorious defenders of the theory humans are headed for a climate catastrophe admitted in 2012 there is low confidence in long term changes in tropical cyclone activity after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities. However over the satellite era increases in the frequency and intensity of the strongest storms in the North Atlantic are robust. However the cause of this increase is debated and there is low confidence in attribution of changes in tropical cyclone activity to human influence. And if all that werent enough its absolutely absurd to say Trump is any way responsible for global warming because even if it is true humans are the primary cause of warming carbon dioxide emissions actually dropped in Trumps first two years in office. In 2017 the United States emitted 41.8 million fewer tons of CO2 than in 2016 the largest reduction in the world. And from 2006 to 2016 the United States has averaged an annual reduction in its carbon dioxide emissions of 1.2 percent according to an analysis by BP. The reason the Washington Post and others are consistently alleging despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary that Republicans are somehow to blame for natural disasters such as Hurricane Florence is either because they know absolutely nothing about the topic or because they believe it will help Democrats win elections. Either way you should stick to what the best available science says not the fear mongering of anti conservative zealots.

Perpetual presidential candidate Bernie Sanders continues his Gimme tour with more and more promises to steal from the poor to give to the rich. This week Bernie met Britta. Britta is concerned about climate change in particular you nasty vile carnivores out there. Britta used her one opportunity to quiz a presidential candidate to ask aboutmeat. Okay. Okay. One second while I get my question. Okay so as you probably know animal agriculture is to blame for the majority of climate change and is the leading cause of deforestation water and air pollution and biodiversity loss. With that being known what do you plan on doing to ensure that Americans limit their consumption of animal products? Climate change is the leading cause of every bad thing on the earth is one hell of a You probably already know Britta. Got any facts to back that up or are we just making assumptions? Because as the great Samuel L. Jackson once uttered on film Never make assumptions. They only end up making an ass out of u and mption'. But Britta doesnt stop there. She goes on to cite Germany as a shining example of who we should want to be like. You may be completely shocked to learn that Bernie Sanders responded by affirming that indeed America needs to be more like the nation that brought us Hitler the Holocaust and the VW Bug only one of those things is good by the way. In case you needed some clarity. Sanders did not say outright that a meat tax is an official policy of his platform but he did give it the old politician shine indicating that he would support such a notion and that also hes interested in helping farmers become more aggressive about combatting climate change. Yes Im sure farmers will be very excited for your help which will be tantamount to them giving up their land their livestock and their livelihood effectively causing a nationwide famine but heysocialists got to socialist. Thank you for the question and its a good question. All I can say is if we believe as I do and you do that climate change is real were going to have to tackle it in every single area including agriculture. Okay? And in fact one of the things we want to do with our farmers out there is help them become more aggressive and able to help us combat climate change rather than contribute to it. So we will certainly youre right weve got to look at agriculture weve got to look at every cause of the crisis that we face. No word yet on if Sanders will be getting equally aggressive with his own multiple vacation properties.	False	False	False	False	False
