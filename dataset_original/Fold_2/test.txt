Progressive political elites have decided that in order to save the environment ordinary citizens must submit to radical lifestyle changes while those same elites fly around the world on private jets and enrich themselves from trade with China the worlds biggest polluter. The reality may even be worse than the headline. Not only have progressive environmentalists suggested that we all switch to a diet of bugs instead of meat especially steak because cow farts produce carbon dontcha know one Swedish scientist even suggested we devour the flesh of deceased humansto cut greenhouse emissions. This followed an article published byNewsweek in which two psychologists mused on the human taboo against cannibalism noting thatphilosophers have argued that burying the dead could be wasteful in the context of the fight against world hunger. Cannibalism for the climate thats how far theyve gone! Population control is another solution embraced by geniuses on the left. This dystopian idea attracted attention recently after Bernie Sanders brought it up at the last Democrat presidential debate saying people need to be need to curb population growth. But Sanders was merely popularizing an idea thats long been the dream of progressive environmentalists. A 2009 study estimated that every human child will produce on average 9441 metric tons of carbon dioxide. As such climate scientists were agitating for global population control long before Bernie made his comments. Looks like China despite its pollution does have something to offer the environmental movement the one child policy! Absent from Bernies argument in favor of curbing the population was an acknowledgment of what itll do to the economy and public services two things that the socialist senator allegedly cares about. An aging populace with fewer young people producing tax revenue means a crisis for public services and a shrinking economy. Of course progressives believe in opening the wests borders to admit millions of working age people from foreign countries so maybe thats their solution. Dont forget that we all have to stop driving if we want to save the climate which means we all have to pack ourselves into dense unaffordable cities instead of living in the suburbs. As left wing environmentalists remind us suburban sprawl also contributes significantly to deforestation. But are there enough affordable homes in the cities? Well that depends on how you define a home. Is a recycled sewer pipe a home? The OPod Tube House is the latest solution imagined for young people who cant afford a real house or apartment in the city. These homes are constructed from recycled industrial piping and are designed to be stacked on top of each other. If that isnt enough of a dystopian cyberpunk nightmare for you consider parasite pods small homes designed to be attached to larger structures like skyscrapers and bridges. Theyre parasitic and we must credit the architectural students who came up with the concept for their refreshingly honest choice of name because they cling to larger structures. Are you ready to be a parasite for the environment? Fried insects for lunch in your parasite pod single occupancy of course. Cycle everywhere unless you want to face crippling carbon taxes. Drink your iced latte with a paper straw dont have kids and when you die remember to donate your human flesh to a local restaurant. Meanwhile our ruling class continues to fly to climate change summits on private jets own multiple CO2 emitting homes and advocate for unrestricted trade with pollution world champ China.

Several high profile Democrats who back the so called Green New Deal are now apparently supporting a new report calling for a dramatic reduction in the worlds population to stave off a climate crisis. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey retweeted links to a report signed by more than 11000 scientists who argue that the population must be stabilizedand ideally gradually reducedwithin a framework that ensures social integrity. The report published Tuesday in the journal BioScience also calls for the wholesale dumping of fossil fuels and the emergence of green energy. They call for a bold and drastic change in economic growth to slash greenhouse gas emissions which research shows contributes to climate change. Ocasio Cortez a Democrat from New York backed the report on Twitter telling her followers in a Nov. 5 tweet that tweaks and shortcuts wont be enough to save the planet. The U.S. must engage in massive systemic change is in alignment with scientific consensus she said. The New York lawmaker retweeted a tweet from The Huffington Post that discusses the reports details. RELATED Ocasio Cortezs Chief Of Staff Admits What The Green New Deal Is Really About And Its Not The Climate Markey made similar comments. 11258 scientists are sounding the alarm we are in a climate emergency. And not just climate scientists. Biologists ecologists more the Massachusetts Democrat said in a Nov. 6 tweet. The crisis touches every aspect of our lives. So must the solution. Thats why we need a to fundamentally transform our society Markey added. He included in his tweet a link to a Washington Post report highlighting the nuts and bolts of the report. Markey and Ocasio Cortez introduced the GND in February which calls for a 10 year national mobilizations toward a series of goals designed to tackled global warming. The GND calls for the country to become carbon neutral within 10 years and seeks to aggressively reduce emissions. Other Democrats are also supporting the general thrust of Tuesdays report. Billionaire Tom Steyer also expressed his support. The world must wake up. We cant sweep climate change under the rug any longer Steyer said in a Wednesday tweet that also linked to WaPos report. World data consistently show that climate change is the least of most peoples concerns. Citizens generally are more concerned about getting a good education obtaining better healthcare and achieving political freedoms than they are tackling climate change according to a 2015 survey from the United Nations. Neither Ocasio Cortez nor Markey or Steyer responded to the Daily Caller News Foundations request for comment.

WASHINGTON Senator Bernie Sanders on Thursday release d a 16.3 trillion blueprint to fight climate change the latest and most expensive proposal from the field of Democratic presidential candidates aimed at reining in planet warming greenhouse gases. Mr. Sanders unveiled his proposal one day after Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington who made climate change the central focus of his campaign announced he was dropping out of the 2020 race. Mr. Inslees absence could create an opening for another presidential aspirant to seize the mantle of climate candidate. Mr. Sanders was an early supporter of the Green New Deal an ambitious but nonbinding congressional plan for tackling global warming and economic inequality. He is bestowing that same name upon his new plan which calls for the United States to eliminate fossil fuel use by 2050. It declares climate change a national emergency envisions building new solar wind and geothermal power sources across the country and commits 200 billion to help poor nations cope with climate change.

The Brando is one of the most luxurious eco resorts on the planet nestling on an atoll in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It's the last place you might think to find pioneering technology. But you'd be surprised. The Brando resort on Tetiaroa a stunning atoll north of Tahiti is the epitome of luxurious exclusivity. Two room bungalows start from 3700 3200 a night. Formerly owned by Hollywood legend Marlon Brando who was keen that it should become an ecological haven it has now developed in to a hideaway for the rich and famous seeking conscience soothing holidays that do less harm to the planet. While some have dismissed the resort as an island for liberal elites Beyonc and Barack Obama were recent guests current owner Richard Bailey claims it is close to becoming carbon neutral and self sustainable. Electricity at the complex for example is generated from solar panels and coconut oil biofuel while waste water is used for sustainable irrigation. And the resort's cooling system uses a closed loop heat exchanger that takes very cold sea water from 900m 2950ft below the surface of the Pacific Ocean to cool the fresh water and air circulating round the complex. As the cooling system is powered largely by water pressure it uses very little energy. It is often felt that sustainability is not compatible with the luxury end of the hospitality market but The Brando proves it is possible says Prof Graham Miller who holds a chair in sustainability in business at the University of Surrey. But of course visitors to The Brando have to fly to Tahiti first then take another 20 minute flight to paradise so their carbon footprint is still significant. The well heeled guests are unlikely to be bitten by mosquitoes either due to a sterilisation programme that has slashed Tetiaroa's mosquito population by at least 95. Led by Dr Herv Bossin of the Institut Louis Malard the programme breeds and releases non biting male mosquitoes infected with a Wolbachia virus that makes wild females who do bite sterile. Similar initiatives aimed at stamping out diseases such as Dengue and Zika are underway in countries such as Australia Colombia and China. But few countries have enjoyed the same level of success as Tetiaroa where mosquito levels are now so low the team is simply not catching any wild females anymore according to Frank Murphy executive director of the Tetiaroa Society the non governmental organisation NGO overseeing the sterilisation programme. The success of the project recently convinced the local government to fund a much larger breeding facility that could see the programme expand to other Pacific islands he says. Mosquitoes are not the only pests the Tetiaroa Society is working to eradicate. Rats are a big problem for the ecosystem of the atoll. Rats eat everything from baby turtles to sea birds and that is bad news for the coral reef too Mr Murphy says. Technology could help here too. The team wants to use 2.2m diameter drones to drop poisonous bait designed to attract rats but not other species. The operation only the second ever will be led by Island Conservation a US NGO that protects endangered species by removing invasive ones. Rats can cause the collapse of the entire terrestrial ecosystem says Island Conservation's Sally Esposito. In the past we have used helicopters to spread bait but we recently used drones for the first time on Seymour Norte in the Galapagos Islands. Tetiaroa is a more difficult environment so it's a great opportunity to test the drones further and should help us to create a haven for endangered native species such as the Polynesian Ground dove and the Tuamotu Sandpiper. Perhaps the most futuristic project on Tetiaroa is the Island Digital Ecosystem Avatar which uses light detection and ranging Lidar surveys to create a 3D model. Other data about animals plants topography and so on will be incorporated to create a model that could be used to predict how the island might react in different scenarios from flooding to the introduction of new species. The Lidar surveys give us a 3D representation of the physical contours of the island including the soils says Tetiaroa Society scientific director Neil Davies a senior fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science. It's a bit like putting the island through a scanner. The team's eventual aim is to capture the atoll's whole ecosystem from molecule upwards so it can help local governments and communities evaluate future risks and make better decisions. Eco tourism is a growing trend that resorts are seeking to exploit around the world as people seek to make more responsible choices in the face of climate change. For example the Parkside Hotel Spa in Canada along with The Brando is one of just a handful of resorts to attain the US Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design platinum certification. It has a 290 sq m 3000 sq ft vegetated roof and uses ponds and storm water storage tanks as a heat sink for its air conditioning system. And actor Leonardo DiCaprio a high profile environmental campaigner and The Brando regular is set to open his Blackadore Caye eco island resort off Belize in 2020. But with tourism contributing around 8 to global greenhouse gas emissions according to one recent paper published in the scientific journal Nature Climate Change all resorts will need to become carbon neutral not just those targeting the world's rich.

With the Democrats ascension to power in the Commonwealth of Virginia following the November 2019 elections the state can expect the new legislature to try and push an aggressively progressive agenda. But you may be surprised just how progressive it is. The Democrats flipped control of the state senate from a 20 19 Republican majority to a 21 19 Democratic majority. They also regained control of the state House of Delegates turning a 51 49 Republican majority into a 55 45 Democratic majority. According to the Washington Post this is the first time in 25 years that Democrats have controlled every lever of state power. Lets take a look at how they intend to use it. Here are some of the most radical bills Democrats have introduced in the statehouse. RELATED Democrats Take Control Of Virginia State Legislature For The First Time In Decades HB 77 unanimously endorsed by the Democratic party in Virginia as part of their pre election platform calls for radical action from the Virginian government in order to address climate change. This bill introduced by Delegate Sam Rasoul states that by 2036 essentially all energy sold must come from clean energy sources. The bill reads in calendar year 2036 and every calendar year thereafter 100 percent of the electricity sold by a retail electric supplier is required to be generated from clean energy resources. The clean energy mandates apply to a public utility or other person that sells not less than 1000 megawatt hours of electric energy to retail customers or generates not less than 1000 megawatt hours of electric energy for use by the person. HB 77 also calls for job training for those workers displaced by the transition to renewable energy sources. Additionally the Democratic majority will allow Northam to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative RGGI. The RGGI is described as the first mandatory market based program in the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nine states are currently members. Permitting 16 year old children to obtain abortions without parental consent is also on the docket for Virginian Democrats. Senate Bill No. 21 states that A minor shall be deemed an adult for the purpose of consenting to Medical or health services related to abortion birth control pregnancy or family planning except for the purposes of sexual sterilization. Prior to this bill Virginia Code 16.1 241 required minors to have the permission of a guardian before having an abortion. If the minor wasnt able to obtain permission then they had to seek judicial authorization during which a judge would determine if the abortion was in the minors best interests and that they were mature enough to make that decision. Tanning is now apparently too dangerous to be done by anyone under the age of 18. This bill bans the use of tanning facility by any person under the age of 18 among other restrictions and does not carve out a parental consent exception. Section G of House Bill No. 38 says No individual under the age of 18 shall be allowed to use any tanning device at a tanning facility. The owner shall be responsible for ensuring that each customer using the tanning facility is of legal age to do so. HB 145 mandates that the Virginia Department of Education come up with school board model policies concerning the treatment of transgender students in public elementary and secondary schools that address common issues regarding transgender students in accordance with evidence based best practices. The bill goes on to describe several areas for this guidance. Some of the proposed specifics are harmless such as section 3 which says that the developed policies should prevent and respond to bullying and harassment. However section 8 calls for standards in accordance with evidence based best practices regarding Student participation in sex specific school activities events and athletics and use of school facilities which can be read as including male female transgender students being included in female specific restrooms facilities and sports. It also calls for guidance regarding the identification of students and compliance with applicable nondiscrimination laws which would include the Equality Act if passed by Congress a big legislative priority of congressionalDdemocrats. If HB 41 passes then board licensed primary care physicians will be required to discuss the potential negative effects of adverse childhood experiences on both mental and physical health during a patients first visit. Doctors will also have to screen patients for adverse childhood experiences that may impact a patients physical or mental health or the provision of health care services to the patient. Gun control is perhaps the most widely known and publicized issue of the 2019 election. Following a shooting in Virginia Beach in June Northam called a special session of the legislature in order to address gun violence. Republicans adjourned the session after 90 minutes. The governor has announced that gun control measures will be reintroduced in January. SB 16 states that it is unlawful for anyone to manufacture purchase possess or transport an assault firearm. A violation of this section is punishable as a Class 6 felony. An assault weapon is defined as The bill furthers prohibits handguns with a fixed magazine capacity in excess of 10 rounds and semi automatic shotguns that has a a fixed magazine capacity in excess of seven rounds among other commonly found features. If the bill passes as it currently stands even current owners of these firearms would face criminalization for what were previously legally owned firearms. RELATED Ocasio Cortezs Chief Of Staff Admits What The Green New Deal Is Really About And Its Not The Climate Virginians can expect a wave of progressive legislation to hit their state over the next several years as the Democrats enjoy having control of the state government. However some push back from state residents might be stronger than expected as the anticipated assault weapons ban has caused 94 counties to declare themselves second amendment sanctuaries. It remains to be seen if any other of the other proposed bills will spark as intense a reaction.	False	True	False	True	False
WASHINGTON The Trump administration is moving forward with a significant rollback of an Obama era cleanwater regulation that has become a rallying cry for farmers and property rights activists opposed to federal overreach. The new proposal unveiled Tuesday morning by actingEPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler and other administration officials wouldease Washington's oversight of small bodies of water undoing a regulationPresident Donald Trump has called a massive power grab. The new rule wouldreplace an Obama administration regulation known as the Waters of the United States rulethat expandedfederal protections to smaller rivers and streams. Environmental advocates warn the proposed rule could remove pollution and development protections from mostU.S. waterways and pose far reaching effects on the safety of the nation's tap water for more than 100 million Americans. Even a child understands that small streams flow into large streams and lakes which provide drinking water for so many Americans said Craig Cox senior vice president for agriculture and natural resources for the EnvironmentalWorking Group. By removing safeguards and allowing industry to dump pollutants into these water sources Trumps EPA is ensuring more contamination challenges for utilities and dirtier water for their customers. But opponents of the Obama era WOTUS rule say it unduly prevents property owners from being able to fully use their land because the rule's overly broad definition regulates ditches that temporarily flood as federally protected waterways. The old rule put Washington in control of ponds puddles and prairie potholes saidWyoming GOP Sen.Tom Barrasso who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee. The regulation was so confusing that property owners and businesses could not determine when permits were needed. The crux of the rollback is a change in how navigable waterways are defined under the Clean Water Act. The 2015 definition crafted under President Barack Obama would narrow considerably under Trump a move that Wheeler told reporters wouldmake it clearer and easier to understand ... that will result in significant cost savings protect the nation's navigable waterways and reduce barriers to important economic and environmental projects. Wheeler cited the Missouri Farm Bureauwhich launched a Ditch the Rule campaign opposing the 2015 proposal because it was concerned theObama era definition was so broad it could apply to almost every acre in the state. The Obama administration claimed it was in the interest of water quality but it was really about power power in the hands of the federal government over landowners Wheeler said. It's also confusing because the rule is enforced in only 22 statesthe District of Columbia and the U.S. territories. Under Trump's proposedrule federal protections would remain for major waterways riverstributaries wetlands adjacent to federally protected waterways certain lakes and ponds reservoirs and ditches used for navigation or affected by the tide. States would overseemost ditches terrain that fills with water during or in response to rainfall certain wetlands that have been used to grow crops stormwater control ponds and water and wastewater treatment systems. Additionally groundwater would not be federally protected an exclusion Wheeler said that was never supposed to be included. Wheeler disputed claims by environmental groups that the rule would remove federal oversightfrom at least 60 percent of the nation's waterways. But EPA officials also could not say what percentage would lose those protections. Delaware Sen. Tom Carper the top Democrat on the Environment and PublicWorks Committee said the rollback would send the country back to a time when environmental protections were few and far between. Back then the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland Ohio was so polluted that it actually caught on fire. Polluters were allowed to dump toxic waste into our waterways without consequence. Garbage littered our shores Carper said. It isnt just a coincidence that this is no longer the reality in our country. In one of his first acts as presidentTrump signed an executive order in February 2017 to undo the clean water rule and instructed the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to come up with a new approach. In a Roosevelt Room ceremony with farmers and lawmakers at the time Trump called the rule one of the worst examples of federal regulation. The debate over the water rule was part of a larger political flashpoint over environmental issues during the 2016 presidential campaign as Trump tried to appeal to rural Americans exasperated by federal regulations and the loss of property rights. While the broader debate centered on climate change and clean air rules the waters rule was nearly as polarizing because its broad application could affect farming construction and other activities near federally regulated waters. The issue has often come down to the definition of navigable waters under the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act of 1972 makes it illegal to pollute navigable waters. Over the decades disputes arose over the government's changing definition of navigable with opponents complainingthe definition was too broad. Two Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 came down on the side of landowners ruling that ponds at the bottom of a gravel pit and a marsh miles from any lake or river were not navigable and thus not subject to the act. Wheeler said he wants the rule to reflect the court rulings.

The following post written by The Rev. Robert A. Franek is a part of Politicus Policy Discussion in which writers draw connections between real lives and public policy. Amid the billowing smoke of the Trump Russia scandal both Donald Trump and the Republicans in Congress have found time to further their agenda of stripping the civil rights away from LGBT people taking healthcare away from women and assuring that scientific data be kept away from the Environmental Protection Agency. Each of these is an outrageous moral failure. Each is a step backward in our nations progress towards greater equality for all. And each is a threat to the life liberty and pursuit of happiness guaranteed to every person. While the present civil rights challenge for LGBT people persists and the funding for Planned Parenthood hangs in the balance the damage being done to our environment through toxic pollution of water systems and neglecting climate change realities even to the omission of scientific data will be much harder to restore with a new administration and Congressional priorities. The Trump Russia scandal smoke will eventually clear but the carbon dioxide billowing into the atmosphere is doing permanent damage. More the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines present real threats to land and waterways for millions of people. Rolling back environmental protection regulations and willful denying of scientific data to forestall efforts to fight climate change is a direct threat to each persons right to life liberty and pursuit of happiness. When the air we breathe and the water we drink are imminently threatened so that corporations can make more money life liberty and the pursuit of happiness are on the line. It would seem that these fundamental freedoms would be something especially Republicans would want to defend in the cause of patriotic duty. However as the Trump Russia scandal has proven time and again there is no limit as to the Republicans will to put party over the good of the country. The threats to life because of environmental deregulation and not addressing climate change are more than theoretical. All kinds of illnesses are on the rise and can be traced to chemicals in air and water. Storms are becoming more and more severe causing greater damage homes businesses and entire communities. And still repugnant Republicans put profits over people and stupid over scientific data. Without a habitable environment that is safe from toxic waste harmful chemicals and dangerous carbon dioxide emissions leading to an ever warming planet how can anyone be assured of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness? When the environment poses an unnecessary threat to ones health life is denied. One might expect the so called party of life to be concerned about this. But one would be grossly mistaken. If there was any care for life beyond birth they would not be stripping rights away from LGBT people or denying women access to healthcare much less actively working to endanger and destroy the necessities for life air and water. Amid the Trump Russia scandal and the smoke that continues to billow around the White House and Congressional Republicans we must not lose sight of the actual smoke and pollution destroying our planetary ecosystems that sustain life for us and all creation. Securing the long term future of civil rights for LGBT people womens access to heath care and the flourishing of our environment that we may all enjoy life liberty and the pursuit of happiness rests not only on getting to the bottom of the Trump Russia scandal and draining the swamp in his administration along with the scandal covering right denying profit seeking in Congress but also on preventing the confirmation of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Assuring that all have life liberty and the pursuit of happiness is a fundamental moral commitment that we share as citizens working together for the common good of all people and the whole creation.

An upstate New York local official has promised no quarter in his towns battle against a planned wind power farm thathasDemocratic Gov. Andrew Cuomos support. Yates town councilman John Riggi opposes Apex Clean Energys plan to build a 200 megawatt wind turbine project over the objections of local officials and a majority of voters. Riggi says hes not opposed to green energy but doesnt want it nearby if his constituents dont support it. He wrote an editorial in a local paper this week pledging to accept no quarter in the fight against the Lighthouse Wind farm. The main concern is the desires of the constituency who are massively opposed to this project Riggi told The Daily Caller New Foundation. It is like 87 percent opposed. Cuomo plans to drastically increase New Yorks wind power capacity as part of his effort to phase out fossil fuels. Cuomo wants New York to get 50 percent of its electricity from green energy source by 2030. Cuomodid not return requests for comment to TheDCNF. Some of these turbines would be 750 feet high Riggi said. They want to put 70 of them in a 24 square mile area. It would completely change the community into something very different from how it feels Riggi said. People live here because they like rural living. They dont want their areas turned into industrialized zones. Lighthouse Wind could also run into opposition from environmentalists who are increasingly turning against wind power at the local level. Environmentalists have become concerned with wind powers impact on birds and bats. Wind farms kill an estimated 573000 birds and 888000 bats a year according to a 2013 peer reviewed study published in Wildlife Society Bulletin. Wind farms are projected to kill 1.4 million birds annually by 2030. This area sits astride the preeminent bird and avian flyway on the North American continent Riggi said. We have birds coming in massive amounts. Theres an issue with that. Its a danger to the birds and bats. Wind farms kill an estimated 573000 birds each year as well as888000 bats according to a 2013 peer reviewed study published inWildlife Society Bulletin.Wind farms are projected to kill1.4 million birds annuallyby 2030. Apex Clean Energy also works to ensure that our projects are responsibly sited for wildlife by conducting in depth environmental impact studies for every project Cat Strumlauf a spokesperson for Apex told TheDCNF. At every stage of development and operation we coordinate with federal and state wildlife agencies to make sure that our projects are sited in areas where impacts to birds or bats are minimized and appropriately mitigated if necessary. The projectcould harm with the regions economy potentially creating problems fora nearbyU.S. Air Force base. We also have an Air Force base 30 miles from the proposed project site Riggi said. The base is concerned about the wind project because it would mess with the radar. We have an aerial refueling and drone mission there. It could impact how theyre performing as well. The wind farm could make a nearby military base which is a critical part of the local economy much less useful. The base pump 200 million a year into the region and employs over 2600 people. Apex Clean Energy takes the safety and readiness of our military very seriously and we work closely with the Department of Defense and its services to ensure our wind energy facilities do not adversely impact military missions Strumlauf said. Riggi is also worried about the health concerns involving wind turbines. One of most common complaints about wind turbines by local residents is that they cause flickering when the sun is behind their blades. This is generally agreed to be incredibly annoying and theres evidence that it can cause headaches sleep disorders anxiety and depression symptoms in people who live nearby. Finally Riggi is concernedCuomos green goals give local governments very little flexibility to determine how they go green. One of the thing the governor is very clear on is that he wants all towns to become more green Riggi told TheDCNF. What I dont understand is with all of this going on why would the governor not allow the towns to choose how theyll support this initiative. Theres no flexibility. New York state currently gets less than 5 percent of its electricity from wind and solar according to the Energy Information AdministrationEIA. Thats a long way from Cuomos 50 percent by 2030 target. Do we want to reduce our carbon footprint? Riggi said. Certainly. But were not being given the option of deciding how to do it ourselves. Were full in on renewable energy but the town wants to have a choice. We want to be the ones to make the decisions on how were going to contribute.

NASAs Cassini spacecraft has detected hydrogen molecules in the geysers shooting off the moon Enceladus possibly the result of deep sea chemical reactions between water and rock that could spark microbial life scientists announced Thursday. NASA and others are quick to point out this latest discovery does not mean theres life on Enceladus ehn SEHL uh duhs but that there may be conditions favorable for life. A liquid ocean exists beneath the icy surface of Enceladus which is barely 300 miles 500 kilometers across. Scientists have long known about the plumes of water vapor spewing from cracks at the moons south pole thanks to Cassini . The heavy presence of hydrogen suggests chemical reactions between the warm water and ocean floor rock that could support life. Cassini uncovered the hydrogen during its final close flyby of Enceladus in 2015 when it dove deeper than ever through its plumes of vapor and particles. The researchers reported that the hydrogen along with carbon dioxide that was also found could mean that undersea microbes are producing methane as they do in the bowels of our own oceans and waterways. It really represents a capstone finding for the mission said Cassinis project scientist Linda Spilker noting that the spacecraft has been circling Saturn for more than a decade. We now know that Enceladus has almost all of the ingredients that you would need to support life as we know it on Earth she said at a NASA news conference. A press conference viewer asking questions of the scientists via Twitter asked if NASA was talking about bacteria or algae or giant squids. Most of us would be excited with any life said Mary Voytek an astrobiology senior scientist for NASA. Were going to start with bacteria and if we get lucky maybe theres something thats larger. The findings were reported Thursday in the journal Science by a team from Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. Launched in 1997 and now finally running low on fuel Cassini is drawing ever closer to its demise. The spacecraft will duck through the gap between Saturn and its rings 22 times before spiraling out of control and vaporizing in the sky above Saturn this September. Cassini has no instruments that can detect life so it will be up to future robotic visitors to seek out possible life on Enceladus the scientists said. Europa an ice covered moon of Jupiter also believed to have a subsurface ocean may have water vapor jets spewing into space as well similar to Enceladus. The Hubble Space Telescope has observed what looks to be plumes emanating from Europa. A spacecraft under development called the Europa Clipper to launch sometime in the 2020s could shed more light on the matter. Voytek said her money is still on Europa for potential life versus Enceladus since Europa is much older and any potential life there has had more time to emerge. While questions remain Thursdays news represents an important advance in assessing the habitability of Enceladus Woods Hole Oceanographic Institutions Jeffrey Seewald wrote in a companion article. We still have a long way to go in our understanding said Seewald who was not involved in the study. Future missions to explore oceans beyond Earth will answer many of these questions.

Reuters U.S. presidential hopeful Kamala Harris campaign is finalizing a plan to tackle climate change that will center on cracking down on fossil fuel companies and protecting poor neighborhoods from the worst impacts of global warming according to two sources familiar with the matter. The plan is meant to set the U.S. senator from California apart in a crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates by drawing on her experience prosecuting polluters as a California attorney general and district attorney. At the same time it is intended to assuage environmental activists worried that she has downplayed climate change on the campaign trail. All of the other top tier presidential candidates have already detailed aggressive plans to eliminate U.S. greenhouse gas emissions within 10 to 30 years tapping into what has become a crucial issue for Democratic voters. She wants to distinguish herself from other candidates that have already laid out climate plans with her own approach that plays to her strengths focusing on environmental justice and enforcement said one of the sources. Like the other candidates Harris plan will also likely target a swift end to fossil fuels use though the details are still being drafted the sources said. The campaign is expected to release the plan ahead of a climate change focused town hall with the candidates on Sept. 4 they said. A spokeswoman for Harris campaign Kate Waters declined to comment on the details but said Harris would be releasing something soon. While activist groups say they are generally happy with Harris environmental credentials she has drawn their criticism since launching her presidential bid. Last week for example she came under fire from the Sunrise Movement and other climate change activists when she initially declined to participate in the televised Sept. 4 climate change town hall to attend a fundraiser. Her campaign later announced she had changed her plans and would attend. During campaign speeches she tends to include a brief mention of climate change calling it a real crisis and adding that she would re engage the United States in global efforts to fight it if elected. Republican President Donald Trump has rolled back U.S. climate change rules he views as damaging to the economy and announced plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement an international accord to limit global warming. Bahram Fazeli director of research and policy for Communities for a Better Environment a California focused environmental justice group said Harris record on the environment was decent. As a senator Harris was among the original co sponsors of the Green New Deal a nonbinding congressional resolution to zero out U.S. emissions by 2030 and introduced bills to denounce Trumps efforts to roll back Californias vehicle emissions standards and drill for oil and natural gas in federal waters. She has also co sponsored an environmental justice bill with Green New Deal author congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez which includes the creation of a federal office for environmental justice. Previously as Californias attorney general Harris was charged with protecting the states progressive environmental laws in the courts. Her biggest environmental victory according to green groups came in 2016 when a grand jury indicted Plains All American Pipeline on criminal charges related to a 2015 oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara. She also reportedly launched an investigation in 2016 into whether Exxon Mobil lied to the public and shareholders about the risks of climate change though her office never confirmed the probe. Since then both New York and Massachusetts have pursued cases against the oil company. Earlier as district attorney for San Francisco Harris also created the citys first environmental crimes unit.

President Donald Trump tweeted Sunday that a series of deadly wildfires hitting California are 'being magnified made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren't allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized.' Trump complained that the water is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean and called for clearing forests as a means of stopping fires from spreading. He didn't thank the armies of firefighters who are battling the blazes or the nine people who have died in the infernos. In September 2017 Trump's Interior Department ordered national parks to clear underbrush and small trees as a preventive measure. Two White House spokespersons did not respond to a question Monday about what Trump's tweet meant. But the president's claim about water drew a combination of laughing and head scratching on Sunday although years of drought may be one factor in the fires' quick spread. 'It boggles the mind' said UC Merced professor LeRoy Westerling who specializes in wildfire and climatology. 'We do manage all of our rivers in California and all the water is allocated many times over. So Im not sure what he was recommending' he told the San Francisco Chronicle. The only broadly discussed proposal for diverting water away from the Pacific came three years ago from a group calledTree People which called for more Californians to collect rainwater draining off roofs and down concrete streets. California already strictly metes out water rights for agricultural industrial and residential use. Firefighters haven't complained about a lack of water resources. And most engaged in the effort are using chemical flame retardants. The White House also announced Sunday that Trump had issued a 'major disaster' declaration in affected areas of Shasta County where about 150000 acres west of the city of Redding are engulfed in flames. That move gives Californians access to unemployment assistance food aid and legal and mental health counseling and makes federal financial assistance available to cities and counties that will have to repair billions of dollars worth of infrastructure damage. It also allows federal agencies to help battle the 17 major fires burning throughout the state including what is now known as the 'Carr fire' which is just 40 per cent contained and has incinerated more than 1000 homes.

Former Secretary of State John Kerry and Rep. Thomas Massie R Ky. had a heated exchange Tuesday over Kerry's education andclimate change. Kerry 75 appeared before the House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing to talk about climate change. The incredible exchange began when Massie read a quote Kerry said regarding President Trumps advisers. It sounds like youre questioning the credentials of the presidents advisers but I dont think we should question your credentials today. Isnt it true you have a science degree from Yale? Massie asked Kerry. Kerry replied that he had a bachelor of arts degree from the university. JOHN KERRY 'IT'S A MISTAKE TO TALK ABOUT IMPEACHMENT' Yes its political science the former Massachusetts senator said. So how do you get a bachelor of arts in science? the congressman asked. So its not really science. I think its somewhat appropriate that somebody with a pseudoscience degree is here pushing pseudoscience in front of our committee Massie said before Kerry fired back. Are you serious? I mean this is really happening here? the former secretary of state asked. JOHN KERRY SLAMMED FOR 'SHAMEFUL' SHADOW DIPLOMACY AFTER ADMITTING TO MEETINGS WITH IRAN The two men continued their back and forth before Massie asked Kerry if he was saying the president doesnt have educated adults there now. I dont know who he has there because it'ssecret he replied. Why would he have to have a secret analysis of climate change? The two then began to discusscarbon dioxide levels on the planet today versus millions of years ago. But there werent human beings that was a different world folks Kerry said. So howd it get to 2000 parts per million if we humans werent here? Did geology stop when we got on the planet? Massie asked. This is just not a serious conversation Kerry fired back. Its almost as if someone said Congress has hit rock bottom and Massie replies with hold my beer he wrote. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Massie replied to Kerrys tweet saying Its almost as if someone said No one has less knowledge of science a higher opinion of himself and a bigger carbon footprint than Al Gore and Kerry replies hold my champagne Im going to testify as a climate change expert.

Arriving at the UN General Assembly US President Donald Trump paid no attention to Swedish teen climate activist Greta Thunberg. Caught on camera her stare sparked a thousand tweets and divided the public. While Thunberg was giving a fiery speech at the UNGA Climate Action Summit Trump was speaking at an event about religious freedom. Video from the UN headquarters on East River shows Thunberg scowling as Trump enters the building to speak to reporters not even registering her presence. Trumps critics were quick to make Thunberg their sherodescribing her stare their new life goals and declaring that the 16 year old climate activist became president today. We are all Greta another resistance activist proclaimed sharing a photo of Thunberg scowling at Trump next to a photo of her meeting his predecessor Barack Obama. Conservatives who saw the images reacted differently praising Trump for ignoring Thunberg as if he did it on purpose and even meme ing her scowl to music and song lyrics. Trump has nixed dozens of Obama administration environmental regulations calling them deadly to the economy much to the outrage of climate activists. A faction among the Democrats has since proposed a Green New Deal that would eliminate carbon emissions altogether and reorder the US economy entirely warning that otherwise the world would end in 12 years. Thunberg is even more pessimistic. At the current rate the world will go over the carbon emissions cap in eight and a half years she warned in her speech on Monday. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words she thundered at the world leaders on Monday. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you! Thunbergs fiery speech was likewise met with praise or disdain depending on where one stood in regard to the narrative of manmade climate change. The environmentalist movement is increasingly convinced that humanity is destroying the planet and has already called for banning the production and consumption of meat outlawing fossil fuels and shuttering down nuclear power plants despite the cost and burden on people that may produce. Later on Monday the president did finally notice the young activist. In an apparent jab at Thunberg he tweeted she looked like a very happy girl alongside a clip of her 'angry' address before the UN.

And on Monday 19 buses carrying more than 1500 activists from across the state converged on the state capital to protest Cuomos failure to do more about climate change in his eight years in office and make demands that looked identical to Nixons platform.It was the largest environmental protest against Cuomo since anti fracking activists staged demonstrations in 2014. To some Cuomos status as a climate pariah may be surprising. In 2014 he put a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing or fracking for natural gas in the state. In 2015 Al Gore joined the governor as he announced plans to cut the states greenhouse gases emissions 40 percent by 2030. Last June Cuomo loudly rejected President Donald Trumps move to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord ramping up New Yorks pledge to produce half its electricity from renewables by 2030 and forging a new alliance with the governors of Washington and California to stick to the goals agreed to by former President Barack Obama. Climate change is a reality and not to address it is gross negligence by government said Cuomo according to a new page on the state website with the banner Environment Leadership. But Cuomos policies still fail to meet even the baseline targets scientists say are needed to make a difference on global warming. His reduction targets focus exclusively on power plants ignoring the majority of the states emissions that come from buildings and vehicles. He has no plan to get the state to 100 percent renewable electricity and has offered little to protect low income communities and neighborhoods of color that suffer most from the impacts of climate change. The states pension funds remain invested in fossil fuels and polluters face no penalties in the form of fines on climate linked damage or taxes on emissions. As Nixon gains in the polls and lands magazine covers Cuomo is scrambling to act on long neglected progressive demands. Three weeks ago over coffee and cookies at a Manhattan steakhousethe governor made a deal to disband the Independent Democratic Conference known as the IDC. The group of eight breakaway Democrats in the state Senate caucused with Republicans guaranteeing a conservative majority in the chamber now only one holdout Brooklyn Democrat Simcha Felder has left Republicans with a flimsy one vote majority. Cuomo also signed an executive order last week restoring voting rights to felons on parole and voiced support for legalizing recreational marijuana a policy Nixon made a platform issue in her campaign. On Friday almost simultaneous to the release of Nixons climate platform Cuomo denied a water quality permit to a new natural gas pipeline environmentalists have protested for months and announced a new energy efficiency initiative that would account for one third of the emissions cuts required to meet his 2030 target. But Cuomos next big test on climate change is one he has already failed twice. For the third time in as many years the state assembly is slated to vote this week on the latest version of the New York State Climate and Community Protection Act known as the CCPA. The bill is widely considered the most ambitious and egalitarian climate legislation introduced anywhere in the nation. Heather McGhee president of the left leaning think tank Demos and the economist Robert Reich called it the most progressive climate equity policy weve seen. The legislation first introduced in 2016 calls for 100 percent renewable energy statewide by 2050 and orders state agencies to draft plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions from power plants buildings and vehicles. It requires 40 percent of state energy funding to go to the low income neighborhoods and communities of color most vulnerable to sea level rise and extreme weather and includes wage standards backed by labor unions for all state funded green energy projects. If enacted the bills proponents say it would create more than 100000 jobs. For Assemblyman Steve Englebright the Long Island Democrat who first introduced the CCPA the bill is 20 years overdue. The 71 year old lawmaker from Setauket a coastal hamlet on Long Island Sound started warning about the threat of runaway global warming two decades ago. He has since sponsored several bills to support solar and wind production at least three of which became laws. In 2016 he became chairman of the Assembly Committee on Environmental Conservation and moved swiftly to draft and introduce the CCPA. There needs to be some adjustments made in the perception of how important this bill is to bring it into the executive chamber ready for the governors signatureEnglebright said Friday. If we can get it onto his desk hell have no choice but to sign it. New Yorkers overwhelmingly support environmental regulations even at an economic cost. Seventy one percent of New Yorkers support expanding renewable energy generation even if it raises electricity prices compared to 61 percent nationwide according to Cooperative Congressional Election Studys 2016 survey results analyzed for HuffPost by Data for Progress a left leaning think tank. That support cuts across demographics including 75 percent of people aged 18 to 29 and 67 percent of people 65 years and older 73 percent of urban dwellers and 67 percent of rural New Yorkers and 74 percent of black people and 69 percent of whites. Sixty seven percent of New Yorkers support strengthening enforcement of clean air and water regulations even if it costs U.S. jobs compared to 58 percent nationwide. The support breaks down similarly across the state with 73 percent of people aged 18 to 29 and 61 percent of people 65 and older 71 percent of urbanites and 60 percent of rural people and 75 percent of black people and 64 percent of whites.

As California wildfires claimed their seventh victimDonald Trumpfinally weighed in on the tragedy with one of his most confounding tweets ever blaming California for the blazes because it diverts water to the Pacific Ocean. He also blamed the states bad environmental laws the most protective in the nation and trees. He called for a tree clear to stop fire spreading. He failed to express condolences to the families of the victims thank firefighters or offer comfort to Californians afraid for their lives homes and communities. California wildfires are being magnified made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which arent allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized. It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire spreading! Donald J. Trump August 5 2018 The tweet came just days after the Trump administration moved to scrap tough vehicle emissions standards initially established by California. The move would clear the way for vehicles to pump an additional 600 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by 2030. Thats the equivalent of the entire annual emissions of Canada. Its unclear what the president meant by water diverted into the Pacific. California allocates water among residents agricultural and industrial useand for wetlands and wildlife including water mandated to protect endangered species. But state waters eventually drain into the ocean.As one tweeter responded Water running into the Pacific Ocean is called a river. And firefighters havent complained of a lack of water for battling the blazes. The tweet could be a muddled indication of support for a GOP battle in Washington for a larger water allocation to farmers many of them Republican voters in the drought stricken states central valley. But its unclear how that would help staunch California fires. The scientific consensus is that fires are becoming more common because of climate change which Trump once called a Chinese hoax. Twitter users were stunned the president failed to express concern about people suffering in the fires. But most readers were stumped or derisive. One responded Thanks genius. Problem solved. As a professor who specializes in wildfire management there are a lot of things that are broken about how we prepare for fight wildfires... but its near impossible to overstate how ridiculous this comment is. Eric Kennedy August 5 2018 I had to come look if this was a real tweet. Ummmmm....gee..... You seem to know next to nothing about California. Fires are more often fought with flame retardant. Mowing down a forest to keep the forest from burning is on the crazy side. bree brinkenstein August 6 2018 Thank you for your heartfelt words of concern and support for the families who have lost everything. Primrose Lane August 6 2018 No you scientists have been seeing the fingerprints of all over these fires and it's making them far worse. Why don't you offer your condolences and then maybe read something aside from the McDonalds menu Miroslava Korenha August 6 2018 By tree clear I'm sure you're talking about logging. You're not interested in fire safety. All you want to do is destroy nature and make corporations richer. Audrey August 6 2018 How about a shout out to the 15000 Firefighters who are putting their lives on the line backed with a commitment of support? That is what a real President would do. Big Ass Mustache August 6 2018 JUST IN The President of the United States blames environmental protection laws for California wildfires and believes that useful fresh water is being diverted to the Pacific Ocean. It remains unclear if he also believes that the Earth is flat and the sun revolves around it. Trump Thoughts August 5 2018 So...you want to stop trees from catching on fire...by removing the trees...? But I thought you believed so strongly in the environment. You said so! Andrew August 6 2018 I fixed your tweet boo. Dont worry. I always got your back. My hart goes out to all those infected by the kalifornia wildfires. Im working alongside my addministration to formulate a plan of action to swiftly dayliver aids and support to all the suffered comuntitties. Joe Bereta of The Valleyfolk August 5 2018 So how do you explain the fires in Wyoming Idaho Nevada Arizona Texas and Montana? Those states aren't exactly models of environmental regulation and yet they are burning also. Eric Foltz August 6 2018 What are you going to do with the massive amount of water that doesnt exist in California? Your destructive environmental policy is what causes climate change. Stop rolling back fuel auto standards. Fix the EPA dont dismantle it. Be the solution not the problem. Right! Zardoz commands that Trump should be impeached!

President Trump followed through on his campaign promise to withdraw from the Paris climate accord by formally announcing the U.S. intention to pull out of the agreement saying the move would help American workers and the economy. The Paris climate accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering an agreement that disadvantages the U.S. leaving American workers who I love and tax payers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs and lower wages and vastly diminished economic reduction Mr. Trump said. Following Mr. Trump's announcement reaction from both supporters applauding Mr. Trump's move as well as those who disagree with the pull out was swift across the political spectrum. The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created. I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack. But even in the absence of American leadership even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future I'm confident that our states cities and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got. Removing the United States from the Paris Agreement is a reckless and indefensible action. It undermines America's standing in the world and threatens to damage humanity's ability to solve the climate crisis in time. But make no mistake if President Trump won't lead the American people will. President Trump's decision is profoundly in conflict with what the majority of Americans want from our president but no matter what he does we will ensure that our inevitable transition to a clean energy economy continues. The Paris climate agreement was simply a raw deal for America. Signed by President Obama without Senate ratification it would have driven up the cost of energy hitting middle class and low income Americans the hardest. In order to unleash the power of the American economy our government must encourage production of American energy. I commend President Trump for fulfilling his commitment to the American people and withdrawing from this bad deal. I applaud President Trump and his administration for dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama Administration's assault on domestic energy production and jobs. President Obama made commitments in this deal based off a costly power plan that we knew at the time was on shaky legal ground. By withdrawing from this unattainable mandate President Trump has reiterated his commitment to protecting middle class families across the country and workers throughout coal country from higher energy prices and potential job loss. President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement is a devastating failure of historic proportions. Future generations will look back on President Trump's decision as one of the worst policy moves made in the 21st century because of the huge damage to our economy our environment and our geopolitical standing. Pulling out of the Paris agreement doesn't put America first it puts America last in recognizing science in being a world leader and protecting our own shore line our economy and our planet. It's now crystal clear President Trump is comfortable both ceding the moral high ground and the economic upper hand to countries like China and endangering the future of our planet. By walking away from this pact President Trump is abandoning America's leadership position in the fight against the climate crisis and is sending a strong message to the rest of the world to create design and manufacture clean energy solutions and create jobs elsewhere. If President Trump wants nations like China and India to take stronger and swifter action on climate then he should do so through the accountability and enforcement provisions in the Paris Agreement not by breaking our word and storming out of the room. Today the President announced that the United States will no longer be bound by an agreement unilaterally entered into by the Obama Administration. This was neither submitted to nor ratified by the U.S. Senate and is not in the best long term economic interest of the United States. President Trump's decision will prove to be the right course of action and one I fully support. Withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement isn't just a setback it's irresponsible. This damages our nation's reputation as an international leader and puts future generations at risk to the threat of climate change. Boston will not standby given what's at stake. As Mayor I will continue to work with U.S. Mayors and cities around the world to uphold the tenets of the Paris climate agreement and protect Boston against the very real impacts of climate change. As a Governor I always worked to balance economic growth and environmental protection. We can and we must do both. President Trump acted in America's best interest moving away from a flawed agreement that placed too heavy a burden on American jobs and opening the door to a new agreement that reaches the right balance. America will remain a leader in environmental protection. But we will not jeopardize our economy in order to please other counties that don't come anywhere near our environmental standards. The decision by the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change is a major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security. The Secretary General remains confident that cities states and businesses within the United States along with other countries will continue to demonstrate vision and leadership by working for the low carbon resilient economic growth that will create quality jobs and markets for 21st century prosperity. It is crucial that the United States remains a leader on environmental issues.	False	False	False	True	True
The proposal also says companies that emit greenhouse gases should be protected from lawsuits over their contribution to climate change. Michael B. Gerrard the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School and an expert on climate litigation said there had been four suits brought against energy companies over climate change including one brought by the eroding Arctic coastal town of Kivalina Alaska. None of those has gotten very far Mr. Gerrard said but there continues to be talk of more. Mr. Gerrard added If a sufficiently high carbon tax were imposed it could accomplish a lot more for fighting climate change than liability suits. The Climate Leadership Councils plan sets an initial tax of 40 per ton of carbon dioxide produced which would add 36 cents to the cost of each gallon of gasoline sold. The group estimates the tax would raise more than 200 billion a year and the rate would rise over time dampening demand for fossil fuels. The average family of four would receive approximately 2000 in the first year as a carbon dividend the group says. A tax and dividend plan would cut American carbon pollution even as the Trump administration withdraws from the Paris climate accord the group says. Exxon has said for years that it supports a carbon tax at least in the abstract but the company had never formally endorsed a proposal. In 2009 the companys chief executive Rex W. Tillerson who is now secretary of state called carbon taxes a more direct a more transparent and a more effective approach than a cap and trade proposal Congress was considering at the time. In a statement the current chief executive of Exxon Mobil Darren W. Woods said the company was encouraged by the climate groups proposal which aligns closely with our longstanding principles. A company spokesman said the liability component of the plan was not part of the companys decision to endorse it. Some environmental groups did not accept that explanation on Tuesday. Exxon is signing on to this carbon tax proposal because they know its dead on arrival in Congress said Jamie Henn a co founder of 350.org. He added that protection from liability would be important to Exxon which is under investigation for its past statements and actions on climate change. Along with the oil companies the plans corporate backers include Johnson Johnson Unilever PepsiCo and Procter Gamble. Ted Halstead the chief executive of the Climate Leadership Council said the group did not accept corporate contributions. Some environmental organizations including the Nature Conservancy and the World Resources Institute are endorsing the plan. Individual supporters include the theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking Steven Chu a secretary of energy under President Barack Obama Michael R. Bloomberg the former New York mayor and the Indian industrialist Ratan Tata. The plans Republican authors include James A. Baker III and George P. Shultz both former secretaries of state and Henry M. Paulson Jr. a former secretary of the Treasury. But Mr. Halstead said the council had moved a little more to the center adding new leaders like Lawrence H. Summers a secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton and Laurene Powell Jobs a philanthropist and the widow of the Apple founder Steve Jobs. For this to pass it will have to pass on a bipartisan basis Mr. Halstead said. Mr. Summers said the chances that Congress would pass a carbon tax in the near future were low. But he said there is a reasonable shot that there will be an opening that will be taken in the next several years especially because the dividends could benefit low income Americans. Its hard to argue against a fuel tax that Exxons in favor of he said.	True	False	False	True	True
The attorneys representing young people who are suing the federal government in a major climate change lawsuit recently took the unusual step of filing an injunction to stop all new leases for fossil fuel production. If the injunction is granted it would lead to a nationwide moratorium on new fossil fuel permitting and leasing on federal lands and waters until the lawsuit is resolved. No small matter. However existing mining and drilling projects would still proceed. The Juliana v. United States lawsuit filed by 21 young plaintiffs is currently going through pre trial appeals at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The suit alleges that not only did the federal government fail to act to limit climate change it profited off of selling coal oil and gas rights. The government encouraged mining and drilling while knowing full well the hazards caused by burning these fuels namely climate change. In so doing the government has deprived the plaintiffs the youngest is 11 years old the right to a safe and stable climate system. The lawsuit was first filed in 2015 but has proceeded in starts and stops. At one point the Supreme Court stepped in to pause the case days before the trial before allowing it to go ahead. An appeals court has now stepped in to consider the governments motion to dismiss the case. Then on February 7 the plaintiffs filed their injunction against new fossil fuel extraction on government territory. Philip Gregory one of the lead attorneys representing the children filing suit explained that the injunction request is meant to address the urgency of limiting climate change by reducing emissions from fossil fuels immediately. With the case currently tied up in appeals the plaintiffs wanted to make sure the current state of affairs with respect to climate change doesnt get worse as the wheels of justice slowly turn. We would have preferred to go to trial submit our extensive evidence and have the judge require the defendants to come up with a plan a national climate recovery plan for how theyre going to go about doing this Gregory said. As Gregory and the other attorneys for the children wrote in their injunction request This injunction is urgently needed because despite long standing knowledge of the resulting destruction to our Nation and the profound harm to these young Plaintiffs Defendants ongoing development of the fossil fuel based energy system is actively harming Plaintiffs and jeopardizing Plaintiffs ability to obtain the full remedy in their case. Numerous experts including retired Navy Vice Admiral Lee Gunn economist Joseph Stiglitz and climate scientist Eric Rignot have also filed amicus briefs supporting the injunction against new federal fossil fuel development. In response the federal government argued this week that the injunction maneuver is a ploy to bypass proper legal proceedings. Indeed Plaintiffs by their present motion are essentially making a bid in this Court for a substitute mini trial or trial lite which is premature until the pure issues of law now being briefed in this interlocutory appeal are appropriately resolved as a threshold matter wrote attorneys for the US Department of Justice. They described the injunction request as an ambitious attempt to throttle important government functions superintending broad swaths of the national economy. The government also noted that the Juliana lawsuit was filed more than three years ago but the plaintiffs hadnt asked to block fossil fuel leasing until now which undermines the plaintiffs argument that without immediate action they would suffer irreparable harm. However Gregory noted that the government didnt object to any of the evidence presented in the plaintiffs injunction request nor did it present any new evidence for its request to deny the request. Because there is no contrary evidence then we are very optimistic that this injunction will go through Gregory said. The Juliana v. United States is just one of more than a dozen climate change lawsuits underway in the US right now. Besides suing the government several counties and cities are seeking damages from coal oil and gas companies for contributing to climate change which in turn is posing a public nuisance to these jurisdictions. Legal experts say that these lawsuits are long shots and theyre testing the limits of what existing jurisprudence covers. But if they succeed they could set critical precedents lead to billion dollar payouts and radically reshape the effort to limit global warming.	True	False	False	True	True
The permafrost that covers great swaths of Siberia northern Canada Alaska and Greenland is warming twice as fast as other parts of the planet and could be gone by midcentury causing more warming and releasing gigatonnes of carbon dioxide and methane. That has all kind of consequences both locally for this region for the animals and the people who live here as well as globally Max Holmes a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center who is studying the permafrost in Alaska told the New York Times. As global temperatures rise scientists are trying to determine the likely speed and scale of the melting of Alaskas permafrost. In geology permafrost is a thick subsurface layer of soil that remains frozen throughout the year. Located in high latitudes it covers about 24 percent of the land surface in the northern hemisphere and can be up to 1km thick. Some of the permafrost dates back to the last Ice Age. Most of this area is found in Siberia northern Canada Alaska and Greenland. Permafrost is thought to contain about twice as much carbon dioxide and methane as is currently in the atmosphere. When permafrost melts microbes convert carbon to carbon dioxide causing even more warming. Scientists estimate the thawing could contribute as much as 1.7F 1C to global warming over the next several centuries regardless of what nations do to reduce emissions from burning fossil fuels and other activities. Holmes led a team of scientists in July to take permafrost cores sediment and water samples from the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge to better understand how thawing permafrost affects the landscape and how much and what mix of greenhouse gases are released. In order to know how much is lost you have to know how much is there Sue Natali a Woods Hole scientist and permafrost expert told the New York Times. Vladimir Romanovsky a permafrost researcher with the University of Alaska Fairbanks said the temperatures at a depth of 65ft have risen to 5.5F 3C over decades. Minus 3 is not that far from zero Dr. Romanovsky told the New York Times. He estimates that if emissions and warming continue at the same rate near surface temperatures will rise above freezing around the middle of the century. In 2013 the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC projected that temperature increases in Alaska and northern Russia could reduce permafrost by between 37 and 87 percent by the end of this century. If that occurs it could potentially leak 1700 gigatonnes of carbon and methane twice what is already in the atmosphere. A global temperature rise of 2.7F 1.5C above current levels would be enough to start the thawing of the permafrost in Siberia according to scientists from the earth sciences depart at Oxford University in a report published in Science Express in 2016.

The progressive Democratic newcomer from New York joined more than 100 environmental youth activists on Tuesday for a sit in inside House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosis Capitol Hill office to encourage a deal to transition to a 100 percent renewable energy based economy to fight climate change. The demonstration took place the same day that new members of Congress including Ocasio Cortez arrived for orientation. They asked me to join them and I did Ocasio Cortez tweeted of her involvement with members of the Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats who visited several elected officials offices in the building. We can embrace the energy of activism to move our partys goals forward. Pelosis office in a statement shared by Ocasio Cortez on Twitter expressed support for the activists and said that she has recommended reinstating the Select Committee on Climate Change a special climate change committee that was dissolved by Republicans in 2011. House Democrats ran on and won on our bold campaign for a 1 trillion investment in our infrastructure that will make our communities more resilient to the climate crisis while creating 16 million new good paying jobs across the country Pelosis statement read. We welcome the presence of these activists and we strongly urge the Capitol Police to allow them to continue to organize and participate in our democracy. California is burning. Fossil fuel billionaires have a grip on America's democracy. We're running out of time to act. But we're going to win. We'll pass a win the solutions we need. We'll win because we have a movement behind us. And together we're unstoppable. pic.twitter.commw6dKSxPVj 350 dot org November 13 2018 Members of the Sunrise Movement responding to Pelosis support in their ownstatement on Twitter said they welcomed her endorsement but added that words arent enough. The group urged her to step aside if she is unable to mandate such a plan. Ocasio Cortez added that she supports Pelosi reinstating the Select Committee and highlighted the activists requests that the committee draft a Green New Deal calling for 100 percent renewable energy and a commitment from the committees appointed members that they wont accept funding from the fossil fuel industry.

Virginia Del. Lashrecse Aird D If elected Virginia Del. Lashrecse Aird D would be the states first female speaker of the House and the first Black person to lead the legislative body. You have in my opinion a Commonwealth that wants to see that. You have members who have been in our caucus and who will be coming into our caucus that want to see that happen she added. I strongly believe that the other individuals in this race their personal politics has never been about bold progressive leadership so why are they going to start now because they receive a new title? Now the monopolies critics fear that the companies which extract fossil fuels and generate energy in addition to transmitting it will seek to water down any efforts to combat climate change. To the extent that Democrats pass legislation mandating more renewable energy use antitrust crusaders inside and outside the legislature fear that Dominion and Appalachian will try to monopolize production of those new energy sources as well. Having gender equality public safety LGBTQ equality gun safety those are the things we should be able to accomplish regardless of whos in charge Only taking care of those things is such a cheap cop out for what a party should stand for. I want to go beyond those issues said Del. Mark Keam a Fairfax County Democrat who would not say how he plans to vote in the leadership race. How do you change infrastructure so we run on clean energy rather than fossil fuels? We need to get there by breaking down monopolies and increasing competition. Aird is pitching her Democratic colleagues on not only the vision of a more ambitious legislative agenda but also on granting rank and file House Democrats more opportunities to shape caucus priorities. On Friday she released a 14 page report 60 Day Plan for a Stronger Commonwealth outlining her proposals which include the creation of new leadership posts and a new committee dedicated to energy and natural resources. That committee Aird acknowledged would enable the House to take a proactive role in oversight of the states utility monopolies. I feel like I have one foot in the old world and one foot in the new world to lead some of the new folks that came in in 2017 and will be coming in this year she said.

PORTO VELHO Brazil Lingering smoke in the Amazon caused concern Tuesday among Brazilians who say that respiratory problems particularly among children and the elderly have increased as fires in the region rage. The kids are affected the most. Theyre coughing a lot said Elane Diaz a nurse in the Rondonia state capital of Porto Velho as she waited for a doctors appointment at the citys 9 of July hospital with her 5 year old son Eduardo. They have problems breathing. Im concerned because it affects their health. The number of people treated for respiratory issues increased sharply in recent days at the local Cosme e Damia Childrens hospital. This period has been very tough. The dry weather and the smoke causes many problems on children such as pneumonia coughing and secretion Daniel Pires a pediatrician and the hospitals adjunct director told the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper. From Aug. 1 to Aug. 10 the median number of cases was about 120 to 130 children with respiratory problems. From Aug. 11 to Aug. 20 it went up to 280 cases. Amazon fires What would the Earth be like without the Amazon rainforest? Growing fears over the health impacts are emerging as the number of fires in Brazil surges with more than 77000 documented by the countrys National Space Research Institute in the last year. About half of the fires occurred in the Amazon region with most in the past month. But as breathing related ailments appear to be on the rise attention to the issue has largely been overshadowed by growingacrimony between Brazil and European countries seeking to help fight Amazon fires and protect a region seen as vital to the health of the planet. At a summit in France this week G 7 nations pledged to help fight the flames and protect the rainforest by offering 20 million in addition to a separate 12 million from Britain and 11 million from Canada. But Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro a far right climate skeptic who took office this year with a promise to boost development in Latin Americas biggest economy questioned whether offers of international aid mask a plot to exploit the Amazons resources and weaken Brazilian growth. On Tuesday he said that his French counterpart President Emmanuel Macron had called him a liar and would have to apologize before Brazil considers accepting rainforest aid. Macron has to retract those comments and then we can speak Bolsonaro said. In a video message Brazilian novelist Paulo Coelho offered an apology to France for what he called Bolsonaros hysteria saying the Brazilian government had resorted to insults to dodge responsibility for the Amazon fires. Meanwhile within Brazil a number of people said they supported Bolsonaro despite local and international criticism of his handling of the crisis exposing a divide that has split the country. Grace Quale a hospital laboratory technician who attended a service at an evangelical church on Sunday said that critics want to overthrow our president and that she didnt see a link between Bolsonaros environmental policies and the number of people getting treatment for respiratory problems. Mona Lisa Pereira an agronomist also said criticism of Brazils government was skewed. Germany had already been helping through NGOs and they couldnt prevent this Pereira said. It seems like this is the fire of a lifetime. But its not. We have fires every year. Others said in an open letter that the governments discourse and measures are leading to a collapse in federal environmental management and stimulate environmental crimes inside and outside the Amazon. More than 500 employees from the environmental regulator IBAMA signed the letter and included a list of emergency measures they recommended including more qualified management and employees and a greater budget and increased autonomy. The Amazon has experienced an increased rate of fires during drought periods in the last 20 years but the phenomenon this year is unusual because drought has not yet hit said Laura Schneider of Rutgers University New Brunswick. Schneider an associate professor in the geography department said fire is commonly used by people to clear land for cultivation and the actual area burned this year must be measured for an accurate comparison with damage in past years. While many of the recorded fires this year were set in already deforested areas by people clearing land for cultivation or pasture Brazil government figures show that they are much more widespread this year suggesting the threat to the vast Amazon ecosystem is intensifying. But for now more immediate consequences of the raging flames were becoming clear. The worlds largest rainforest is a major absorber of carbon dioxide considered a critical defense against rising temperatures and other disruptions caused by climate change. The government in the Amazonian state of Rondonia has warned that the burning of land can produce smoke that can greatly influence atmospheric pollution putting the life of many at risk. Experts there said that when exposed to smoke residents can suffer from rhinitis sinus and respiratory problems like asthma and bronchitis while chronic exposure can also lead to pulmonary illnesses including lung emphysema. Weve seen that Porto Velho has been taken over by smoke so inhaling those antigens and pathogens can harm the whole citys population Ana Carolina Terra Cruz a specialist in pulmonary illnesses told the state government website. Deep ramifications Trump would cost General Motors billions if he actually orders business out of China On Tuesday some clouds and a blue sky were partly visible in the Porto Velho morning light. But by the afternoon haze had again settled with smoke so thick that it darkened the usually blazing sun. Pereira the agronomist said that smoke was everywhere. Its bad for everyone she said. Not just our children.	True	True	False	True	False
These devastating images show an indigenous family surveying the ruins of their homeland in the Amazon rainforest. Surrounded by dry soil and fallen timber their native land has been all but destroyed by rapid deforestation. During the day the usually fierce sun is obscured by a thick grey smoke caused by deliberately lit wildfires that are raging out of control across Brazil. The smell is of barbecue caused by vast swathes of the worlds largest tropical rainforest going up in flames. Raimundo Mura indigenous leader with the Mura tribe who live in a reserve near Humaita Amazonas state said For the forest I will go on until my last drop of blood. All the trees had lives they all needed to live each in their own place. For us this is destruction. What is being done here is an atrocity against us. The rainforest is home to some one million indigenous people and three million species of plants and animals. But it is being decimated at record rates burnt or cleared for farming and mining. Scientists have recorded more than 74000 fires in Brazil this year an 84 increase compared to the same period last year. They can now be seen from space and have plunged the largest city Sao Paulo into darkness because of the heavy smoke. In total the blazes have created a layer of smoke estimated to be 1.2 million square miles wide that spreads across Latin America to the Atlantic coast. Handech Wakana Mura another local leader within the forest said With each passing day we see the destruction advance deforestation invasion and logging. We are sad because the forest is dying at every moment. We feel the climate changing and the world needs the forest. We need the forest and our children need the forest. Environmentalists and academics have blamed the Brazilian government under far right President Jair Bolsonaro for a sharp increase in Amazon deforestation. The climate change sceptic swept to power in January promising to open up the Amazon to mining and farming. His rhetoric is said to have emboldened farmers to burn large sections of the rainforest for beef and soy production. Camila Veiga of the Brazilian Association of NGOs said The fires are the consequence of a policy of environmental devastation of support for agribusiness of increasing pastures. The fires have been raging for around three weeks and an area the size of a football pitch is said to be lost every minute. Global concern is growing as the rainforest is key to tackling global warming because of the way it absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen. Mr Bolsonaro largely ignored the issue at first and even attempted to blame environmental charities accusing them of lighting the fires. Opposition MPs have said the raging infernos are a crime against humanity and blamed his policies for fuelling the blazes. French President Emmanuel Macron had called the wildfires an international crisis and said the leaders of the G7 group of nations should hold urgent discussions about them during their summit in France this weekend. Mr Macron tweeted Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rain forest the lungs which produces 20 of our planets oxygen is on fire. Mr Bolsonaro hit back at Macron complaining he was the subject of a smear campaign and the media had exploited the fires to undermine his government. His chief of staff Onyx Lorenzoni also accused European countries of exaggerating environmental problems in Brazil in order to disrupt its commercial interests. Relations between Europe and Brazil are at a low which has worried the powerful agriculture sector. Last week Norway joined Germany in halting 60 million worth of Amazon protection subsidies accusing Brazil of turning its back on the fight against deforestation. French and German leaders have also threatened not to ratify a trade deal between the European Union and Mercosur countries Argentina Brazil Paraguay and Uruguay to pressure Brazil into complying with its environmental pledges within the Paris Climate Agreement. In contrast the UK is currently on a trade mission in Brazil attempting to forge closer ties post Brexit. The neighbouring country of Bolivia is also struggling with wildfires many believed to have been set by farmers clearing land for cultivation.	False	False	False	True	False
HuffPost has obtained a list of prominent climate deniers that the Heartland Institute a right wing think tank assembled and submitted to the agency in May. The Illinois based group which hasties to the fossil fuel billionaires who run Koch Industries boasted in July that the White House reached out for help identifying scientists for these debates. This appears to be the list the Heartland Institute provided. The names included on the list suggest that the Heartland Institute wants the debate to go directly after the scientific and legal underpinnings of the EPAs regulations on climate change. Rather than debating the regulatory approaches they want to undermine the conclusion that climate change is a real problem. But while Trump and Pruitt have begun rolling back regulations on greenhouse gas emissions so far they have not attempted to undo the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases pose a threat to human health and the environment a conclusion known as the endangerment finding. It was the EPA under George W. Bush that first made that determination in response to a 2007 Supreme Court ruling but it never acted on that finding. The Obama EPA did and once that conclusion was reached the agency was required by law to issue regulations under the Clean Air Act. Ninety seven percent of peer reviewed research agrees with the conclusion that burning fossil fuels deforestation and industrial farms are enshrouding the planet in heat trapping gases and a research review published last November found significant flaws in the methodologies assumptions or analyses used by the 3 percent of scientists who concluded otherwise. Calls for the red team blue team exercise began in April one month before the date marked on the top of the documents.On April 20 the day before the March for Science protest in Washington D.C. New York University physicist Steve Koonin published an op ed in The Wall Street Journal calling for a red team blue team exercise to put the consensus to the test and improve public understanding through an open adversarial process. The next day Judith Curry a retired climatologist known for mocking other scientists as alarmists and Anthony Watts who runs a popular climate change denial blog endorsed the idea.The next week Pruitt met with Koonin for an hour according to schedules published by The Washington Post. The meeting included about 40 climate scientists economists lawyers and other experts to discuss the possible creation by the Trump administration of a Red Team Blue Team exercise on climate change he wrote. He noted this was the second Red Team briefing following an initial gathering on June 14 in Washington D.C. A final summit is scheduled for Nov. 8 the day before the Heartland Institutes America First Energy Conference in Houston. This seems to be the goal of the list which includes 145 scientists and 60 economists who have long been on the fringes of the climate debate making their names as contrarians given to bombastic public statements. In his email Bast said he assembled a list of around 150 climate experts which he sent to folks at EPA in response to their request for recommendations. A source who requested anonymity provided the list to the watchdog Climate Investigations Center which shared it with HuffPost. Aztec priests told people they must cut out their beating hearts to bring better climate for their crops. The people believed them he wrote in a December 2015 blog post. Todays climate priests tell people they must cut out their CO2 emissions and pay penances to other nations like China to save our climate. The people believe them. I would go right down to the core starting with the question How much do human emissions increase atmospheric carbon dioxide? Thats the first assumption the blue team makes and they have to prove that thats true he said. In my opinion the red team would win that debate on the carbon dioxide. Carlin spent decades as an economist working at the EPA before becoming a conservative media darling for publicly accusing the agency of muzzling his criticism of the endangerment finding. He was never assigned to work on climate change and holds a doctorate in economics not atmospheric science or climatology and his comments on the finding were deemed to be the product of rushed and at times shoddy scholarship according to a 2009 analysis by The New York Times. Yet he submitted the 93 page report suggesting the research behind human caused climate change is more religion than science.	True	True	True	True	False
The survey commissioned by the progressive think tank Data for Progress and conducted online from Oct. 11 15 found even stronger support among young voters and people of color. Voters aged 18 29 ranked green jobs as their No. 4 priority and voters of color in that age range ranked it No. 3. In a Gallup poll last month just 1 percent of Americans including Republicans and independents as well as Democrats chose environmentpollution as the countrys most important problem from a list of dozens of issues. In a separate May 2017 Gallup survey just 2 percent of Americans listed create more green jobs as the best policy to increase employment in the United States compared to 19 percent who listed keep manufacturing jobs hereStop sending overseas. The findings come as the Trump administration is on the cusp of fully rolling back two of the most critical federal rules to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Next year the White House is planning a make a new push to build more oil and gas pipelines Larry Kudlow the presidents top economic adviser said at an event this month. Already at least six of the Democratic senators expected to run for president in 2020 are backing legislation to guarantee a job to every American worker who wants one. Its an idea roughly 46 percent of Americans support according to an April survey by Rasmussen Reports. Polling Data for Progress released in September pegged the number slightly higher at 55 percent of eligible U.S. voters but found that those opposed decreased from 23 percent to 18 percent when the guaranteed jobs are green. Even among Trump voters the September survey found support for guaranteed jobs is stronger when the jobs are green with 35 percent in support and 36 percent opposed. Without an environmental focus Trump voters in support of guaranteed jobs dropped to 30 percent with 45 percent opposed. Even in deep red counties in fossil fuel producing states support for requiring utilities to produce 20 percent of electricity from renewables averages well above 50 percent according to 2018 survey data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. Support for providing tax rebates for energy efficient vehicles and solar panels soars well above 75 percent in most of those same counties. Adopting a green jobs plan could also help Democrats ease the tension between the partys labor and climate hawks. In August the Democratic National Committee backtracked on a two month old ban on fossil fuel donations. The move was a cave to unions that overwhelmingly support pipeline projects that pay much better than renewable energy jobs which tend not to use organized labor. Still the policy seems far off at best. Its difficult to imagine such a bill passing a Republican dominated Congress much less gaining Trumps signature. Democratic leadership has indicated it has no plans to push a major climate bill even if the party takes the House of Representatives in next months election. Yet theres a small contingent of left wing candidates including Wisconsin congressional candidate Randy Bryce and Kevin de Len the California lawmaker challenging Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein who are running on a so called Green New Deal a reference to the Great Depression era spending programs that established many of the nations infrastructure landmarks. Ocasio Cortez the democratic socialist expected to become the next U.S. representative for New Yorks 14th Congressional District likened climate change to the existential threat posed by Nazi Germany and the Axis. The last time we had a really major existential threat to this country was around World War II Ocasio Cortez said at a campaign event. And so weve been here before and we have a blueprint of doing this before. Climate scientists tend to agree. In July Penn State University climatologist Michael Mann called Ocasio Cortezs proposal for trillions in federal spending on a Green New Deal to be just the sort of audacious and bold thinking we will need if we are going to avert a climate crisis. Just three weeks ago a sobering United Nations report warned that world governments have just 12 years to halve emissions in order to avert cataclysmic climate change. And even then the researchers found that technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere will be required to keep warming within 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit beyond which scientists say many densely populated places will become uninhabitable. Progress to mitigate climate change has been alarmingly limited. Despite the rapid construction of renewable energy infrastructure the United States the worlds largest per capita emitter is aggressively bolstering its fossil fuel production. Last year Trump announced the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement which every recognized country on Earth has signed. Brazil the vast rainforests of which are critical to absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is poised to elect a president who vowed to ramp up deforestation and withdraw from the historic 2015 accord as well. China the worlds top national emitter is continuing to build new coal plants despite pledging to cancel the facilities.	True	False	False	True	False
WASHINGTON Gasoline oil and other contaminants that threaten groundwater are seeping from more than 70000 underground tanks around the country but the federal aid that has helped address the problem could soon start drying up. The Trump administration is proposing to slash funding for the Leaking Underground Storage Tank program by nearly half next year from nearly 92 million this year to about 47 million in 2018. The recommended cut in the LUST program is part of the presidents proposal to reduce the Environmental Protection Agency budget by 31 next year. Funding for LUST is a drop inthe EPAs 8.2 billion budget. But state officials environmental activists and public health advocates warn that the size of the cut carries great risk considering groundwater is the source of drinking water for nearly half of all Americans. They say such a reduction would hamper monitoring prevention enforcement and cleanup of leaks as well as the important role EPA plays in providing technical assistance to state regulators and businesses many of them gas stations who have aging tanks and piping under their sites. In a letter earlier this year to congressional leaders the head of the trade organization representing state solid waste agencies said the cut would impedethe long term progress states have made on inspection and cleanup. The program has made great strides in increasing the number of compliant tanks in the last 25 years which has resulted in fewer releases wrote Dania Rodriguez executive director of the Association of State and Territorial Solid Waste Management Officials. Loss of program funding would reverse this trend. The Trump administration announced the proposed cut in May two months after the Department of Veterans Affairs officially recognized the harm contaminated water some of it linked to underground fuel tanks inflicted on hundreds of thousands of marines stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina from 1953 through 1987. Under the VA program announced in March those who served at least 30 days in Lejeune during that period are eligible for treatment of eight diseases including several cancers and Parkinsons Disease. There are 558451 active tanks located in about 201000 sites nationwide according to the EPA's most recent tally. Most are service stations but they also include any operation where fuel is stored underground such as government fleet garages large retail operations like Costco stores that sell gas and institutions like hospitals or universities that store fuel to power emergency generators. Across the country thousands of underground storage tanks and accompanying pipes many of them made from older corroding steel hold and carry a variety of fuels and chemicals the Environmental Defense Fund wrote in a recent report. When tanks leak harmful chemicals such as oil gas benzene and toluene into soil and ground water drinking water and soil are fouled community health is jeopardized and economic development is crippled. The number of tanks with confirmed releases hit a high in 1995 with nearly 172000. But the backlog of sites needing to be cleaned up has been declining since 2000 according to EPA records. As of March 31 EPA reported 70094tanks with confirmed leaks. Some of these are not actively leaking but have residual contamination that needs to be cleaned up. Superfund cuts would lead to delays in toxic cleanups experts warn Florida leads the list of states reporting the most leaking tanks with 10421 followed by Michigan 8000 Illinois 5733 New Jersey 5100and North Carolina 4006. Site owners are ultimately liable for cleanup costs but a taxpayer funded trust fund is in place when sites must be addressed quickly are abandoned or when owners dont have the resources. The fund is financed by a 0.1 cent per gallon tax on gasolinewhich generated 202 million in 2016. Administration officials did not offer much explanation for the cut one of dozens proposed in the EPA budget. Historically the underground tank program has worked closely with our state territorial and tribal partners an agency spokeswoman wrote in an email. We know they are on the front lines to protect our land and groundwater from petroleum leaks such as those from gas stations and other underground storage tank facilities and we expect this partnership will continue to be a hallmark of the program. She wrote it would be premature for us to speculate about EPAs budget given that Congress has yet to finalize the agencys funding for next year. The House Appropriations Committee voted in July to restore almost all of the funding for the program but neither the full House nor the Senate has acted yet. The cost of cleaning up a site depends on a variety of factors including the extent of contamination and state cleanup standards. The average cleanup is estimated to cost 130000 but can rise to over 1 million if groundwater is infected. Ben Thomas a former tank inspector and state regulator in Alaska who now consults with private operators on meeting the inspection rules said cutting the program would hurt businesses that have come to appreciate the heavy stick of enforcement for bad players and the general community outreach. Slashing a program known for the collaboration between regulators and businesses and the effectiveness its achieved in reducing the backlog of leaking tanks would be crippling he said. At some point such a deep cut makes any agency effectively non responsive Thomas said. Theres simply not enough money to know what to prioritize. Stuff that makes a big stink like enforcement would probably get cut as would the ability for states to maintain a hotline maintaina web page or do workshops.I could easily imagine all that stuff would be kind of viewed as frivolous and go away because its not core statement message stuff.

In fact its getting bigger scientists now admit. A University of Auckland study examined changes in the geography of Tuvalus nine atolls and 101 reef islands between 1971 and 2014 using aerial photographs and satellite imagery. It found eight of the atolls and almost three quarters of the islands grew during the study period lifting Tuvalus total land area by 2.9 percent even though sea levels in the country rose at twice the global average. Co author Paul Kench said the research published Friday in the journal Nature Communications challenged the assumption that low lying island nations would be swamped as the sea rose. We tend to think of Pacific atolls as static landforms that will simply be inundated as sea levels rise but there is growing evidence these islands are geologically dynamic and are constantly changing he said. The study findings may seem counter intuitive given that the sea level has been rising in the region over the past half century but the dominant mode of change over that time on Tuvalu has been expansion not erosion. If only theyd done their study a bit earlier they could have saved a lot of alarmists a lot of worry. Asrecently as last year anxious wonks produced a paper for the World Bank arguing that the situation in Tuvalu pop. 11000 and nearby Kiribati pop.107000 was so dire that Australia and New Zealand should open their doors to the fleeing refugees. According to the paper In 2007 Grist went so far as to cite Tuvalu of one of climate changes most tragic victims. Climate Change in Tuvalu even has its own Wikipedia page. It records possibly Tuvalus greatest moment of glory on the international stage when it seized the opportunity at the 2009 Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen to grandstand about its terrible plight. In December 2009 the islands stalled talks atUnited Nations Climate Change ConferenceinCopenhagen fearing some other developing countries were not committing fully to binding deals on a reduction in carbon emission their chief negotiator stated Tuvalu is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change and our future rests on the outcome of this meeting.57When the conference failed to reach a binding meaningful agreement Tuvalus representative Ian Fry said It looks like we are being offered30 pieces of silverto betray our people and our future Our future is not for sale. I regret to inform you that Tuvalu cannot accept this document.58 Frys speech to the conference was a highly impassioned plea for countries around the world to address the issues of man made global warming resulting in climate change. The five minute speech addressed the dangers of rising sea levels to Tuvalu and the world. In his speech Fry claimed man made global warming to be currently the greatest threat to humanity and ended with an emotional the fate of my country rests in your hands.59 Tuvalus plightalso formed part of the basis for arguably the most hysterical fake news claim in the history of climate alarmism the UNs prediction that by the end of 2010 climate change would have created 50 million environmental refugees. The UN has since removed the claim from most of its websites. Happily it can still be glimpsed in the Guardian archives Rising sea levels desertification and shrinking freshwater supplies will create up to 50 million environmental refugees by the end of the decade experts warn today. Janos Bogardi director of the Institute for Environment and Human Security at the United Nations University in Bonn said creeping environmental deterioration already displaced up to 10 million people a year and the situation would get worse. There are well founded fears that the number of people fleeing untenable environmental conditions may grow exponentially as the world experiences the effects of climate change Dr Bogardi said. This new category of refugee needs to find a place in international agreements. We need to better anticipate support requirements similar to those of people fleeing other unviable situations. In reality the total number of environmental refugees fleeing climate change so far around the world is close to zero. But that hasnt stopped a few chancers from trying it on Seventeen people from the Pacific including 11 from Tuvalu and five from Kiribati have already made refugee claims in New Zealand citing climate change as part of their basis of claim. None have been successful four have yet to be determined and 13 have been rejected because the refugees convention does not recognise climate change as grounds for protection. Toclimate skeptics the fact that Tuvalu is not drowning will come as no surprise whatsoever. Their favorite sea levels expert Nils Axel Mrner has written numerous papers on the subject.

The Wall Street Journals Kimberley Strassel issued a blistering critique of the proposed Green New Deal saying that the proposal reads like a parody of the Democratic Party done by Republicans. By the end of the Green New Deal resolution and accompanying fact sheet I was laughing so hard I nearly cried Strassel wrote on Twitter. If a bunch of GOPers plotted to forge a fake Democratic bill showing how bonkers the party is they could not have done a better job. It is beautiful. The Green New Deal pushed by freshman New York Democrat Alexandra Ocasio Cortez attempts to radically transform the country including rendering air travel obsolete move the U.S. to rely completely on renewable energy with net zero emissions and guarantee economic security even for people who are unwilling to work. OCASIO CORTEZ CONTRADICTS HERSELF ON ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN MASSIVE AND UNPRECEDENTED 'GREEN NEW DEAL' But the sweeping proposal was hit with mockery once the details were unveiled on Thursday with many pointing out how unrealistic the suggestions are. Strassel pointed out that in order to live up to the proposals promise of 100 percent of renewable energy a space as big as the entire state of California would have to be dedicated solely for the facilities wind turbines and solar panels. The proposals suggestion of putting charging stations everywhere upgrading or replacing every building and developinghigh speed railway across every state may also hit a wall due to permitting laws. FULL TEXT GREEN NEW DEAL FAQ CALLS FOR ABOLISHING 'FARTING COWS' AND 'AIRPLANES' ASAP Strassel notes that the Green New Deal is far from just a proposal to curb emissions and create more environmental regulations its also about implementing radical left wing measures. Somehow government run healthcare family sustainable wages paid leave and affordable housing are also required for a clean economy the writer wrote. I would love to understand this logic. And imagine what wages will need to be to pay for billion dollar per kilowatt electricity. But even those pushing for the document arent sure it can actually be achieved within 10 years. In a now deleted FAQ page on Ocasio Cortezs website the document explains that its calling for an elimination of greenhouse gas emissions rather than an immediate ban on fossil fuels because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast. Planes run on fossil fuel. No fossil fuel no visits to granny. Cows produce methane why alarmists want to get rid of livestock Stressel wrote. She can't do it fully in 10 years but AOC is coming after your air miles and bacon. This is honesty sp about how Democrats would micromanage private life. Lastly the Green New Deal which doesnt exactly reveal how it will be funded except for the suggestion that the Federal Reserve could step in and extend credit. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP And how to pay for mass trillions in cost? Don't worry!

Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden really grabbed the audiences eyes at the climate change town hall literally as his eye filled with blood after a lackluster performance marked by half truths and excuses. The former Vice President was clearly floundering during CNNs climate change town hall on Wednesday which saw him face off against eight other Democrats. Viewers called him out for rambling incoherent answers and held his feet to the fire regarding his coziness with the fossil fuel industry. Then his left eye began filling up with blood. At around the same time his campaign cautioned voters not to turn a blind eye to the way in which environmental burdens are distributed unevenly along racial and socioeconomic lines an ironic coincidence or a sly reference to the unusual anatomic event? Before Bidens eye exploded the audience had been raking him over the coals for a scheduled fundraiser the following night at the home of a natural gas executive. The three time candidate has never been particularly committed to green issues slammed by environmental groups for not having a climate change policy he finally released one in June that contained several plagiarized items. But he had along with most of the other Democratic candidates promised not to take money from the fossil fuel industry a promise the fundraiser seemed to break to viewers dismay. But even the most blatant political hypocrisy was no match for the eye. Look Biden haters sometimes your eye is gonna spontaneously fill up with blood okay one user joked. Twitter furiously deploying algorithms to keep Bidens bloody corpse eye from trending observed another it appeared to work while was trending and variations thereof were noticeably not. Apparently it wasnt even the first time Bidens eye has filled up with blood during an important political event. But some commenters found a way to bring the conversation back to the environment. Not sure after tonight who has less time to live Biden or the planet said one. Joe Biden lied so hard during the climate town hall that his eye started bleeding commented another. I give it 14 minutes before Bidens campaign says his bloody eye was because of climate change predicted another. Meanwhile others made the inevitable comparisons to Hillary Clinton another candidate with a marked enthusiasm gap between donors and voters who has run for president and lost before yet is propped up by the media as the surefire winner. And some took time out from gawking to worry about his health since political speeches dont normally cause visible injury. Does Biden have a blood clot in his left eye? wondered one user. This cant be good news given his health history noted another. Like this story? Share it with a friend!	True	True	False	True	True
Young students across the world plan to skip class on Friday claiming that they will devote the day to protesting man made climate change. Students from more than 70 countries will skip class on Friday March 15 to demand that their governments take more action on addressing climate change according to a youth led movement that is behind the strike. Tens of thousands of students will reportedly take part in the event. We will no longer accept this injustice. We demand justice for all past current and future victims of the climate crisis and so we are rising up read an open letter that the activists published on the Guardian claiming they would be protesting on every continent on Friday. Thousands of us have taken to the streets in the past weeks all around the world. Now we will make our voices heard. 350.org an international environmental group is helping bolster the strike with its own promotional video. Activists are hoping to closely mirror the youth led March For Our Lives protests in Washington D.C. which took place nearly a year ago following the fatal Parkland Florida school shooting and spark more debate among lawmakers about the dangers of climate change. Activists in the U.S. are making similar demands that are found in Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortezs Green New Deal a swift transition to 100 percent renewable energy a complete abolition of fossil fuels and other environmental mandates. The group strongly references the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes 2018 report which claims the world only has a few year to dramatically reduce carbon emissions or else face dire environmental consequences. RELATEDThousands Of Students Ditch Class To Join Climate Change Protests We have the right to live our dreams and hopes the letter continues. Climate change is already happening. People did die are dying and will die because of it but we can and will stop this madness. The protesters in Washington D.C. will enjoy the presence of one well known adult figure Minnesota Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar. The freshman Democrat who has made national headlines recently for a slew of anti Semitic remarks says she will attend the strike along with her 16 year old daughter Isra Hirsi an organizer of the protest.

The EPAs decision was not unexpected. During the 2016 presidential campaign Trump said the United States faces numerous problems more important than climate change and he pledged to eliminate environmental policies hampering economic growth and domestic energy development targeting the CPP by name. As part of Trumps March 28 Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth executive order Trump directed EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt to review CPP and rescind or revise it if necessary to promote the wise development of natural resources unencumber energy production and increase jobs. The EPA based the decision to rescind CPP on three main principles CPP is inconsistent with the 1970 Clean Air Act CPP violated states authority to decide the best mix of power generation within their borders and eroded longstanding federalstate partnerships necessary to achieve environmental improvement and enforcement of CPP would have had a devastating effect on jobs and raised energy costs for consumersall while having virtually no effect on climate change. CPP was the centerpiece of the Obama administrations effort to move the United States away from the use of fossil fuels beginning with coal to fight climate change. CPP would require states to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 on average. To comply with the plan states would have to force utilities to shutter dozens of coal fired power plants prematurely. The Energy Information Administration projected CPP would result in 1.23 trillion in lost gross domestic product GDP in 2014 dollars from 2020 to 2030 with an average annual GDP loss of 112 billion. Estimates indicate CPP would boost peoples electric bills 1114 percent per year and cost more than 100000 jobs in manufacturing and other sectors annually. Despite these substantial harms the Obama administration acknowledged in testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Science Space and Technology on July 9 2015 that if the United States met CPPs emission reductions targets it would prevent at best one one hundredth ofone degree Celsius of temperature rise by 2100. Talk about all pain and no gain! Twenty seven states led by West Virginia and several industry groups and trade associations challenged CPPs legality in federal court. In February 2016 the U.S. Supreme Court took the unprecedented step of ordering a nationwide stay on implementation of CPP before it went into effect pending the outcome of the legal challenges. CPP would have dramatically raised energy costs in United States harming the poorest among us more than the rest and putting U.S. industries at a competitive disadvantage in the global economy. By rescinding it Trump is doing what he promised to do and what any president should do putting America first. Bravo! Having said this unless Trump wants these gains to unravel he has at least one more step to take. Environmental groups and some state government officials have already announced that if the CPP rescission is finalized they will sue to block the Trump administrations action to keep CPP on the books. In truth this presents a problem for Trump. CPP and the other climate regulations imposed by the Obama administration were justified based on the EPAs determination carbon dioxide poses a threat to human health and the environment a concept known as the endangerment finding. Relying on unsubstantiated projections produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the EPA determined carbon dioxide emissions from cars and industry threaten human welfare. To solidify his CPP action and other climate deregulatory efforts Trump must direct the EPA to reconsider the endangerment finding by forcing the agency to demonstratethrough independent validated researchcarbon dioxide emissions are toxic they arent at any foreseeable levels or that global warming is causing measurable amounts of sea level rise increased hurricane numbers or intensity the spread of disease or other harms attributable directly to carbon dioxide emissions in the United States. If the EPA cant directly link such problems to U.S. carbon dioxide emissions it cant or cant show that such problems can be dramatically reduced by cutting U.S. carbon dioxide emissions they wont the EPA should withdraw the endangerment finding. Withdrawing the endangerment finding would eliminate the legal justification that has been used to impose a wide range of climate regulations. In the process it would also end radical environmental activists ability to use the courts to impose policies on an unwilling publicone whose elected representatives have repeatedly rejected climate alarmism.

President Trumps claim that Californias environmental policies are preventing firefighters from accessing enough water to stop the states wildfires has been roundly dismissed by experts and state officials. Windy conditions and high heat expanded the Mendocino Complex Fire to 290692 acresby Tuesday morning making it the largest wildfire in the states history destroying some 75 homes and forcing thousands to evacuate. Seven other major wildfires are burning in California from Shasta County to San Bernardino County at the same time. Trump made the dubious claim that readily available water is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean for environmental reasons and blamed California Gov. Jerry Brown in a series of tweets. California wildfires are being magnified made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which arent allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized. It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire from spreading! Trump tweeted on Monday. Yahoo News reached out to Scott McLean a deputy chief at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Cal Fire to get the agencys take on Trumps claims and whats actually happening in the efforts to stop the Mendocino Complex and other wildfires. He outright rejected the assertion that firefighters do not have enough water to handle the current wildfires. No that is untrue. There are bodies of water. There are lakes near the Carr Fire the Shasta Lake the Whiskeytown Lake thats surrounded by the fire Trinity Lake we have plenty of water Sacramento River is just to the east McLean said. On your Mendocino Complex its wrapped around Clear Lake. Its got Mendocino Lake Berryessa Lake and it has a river close by so there are absolutely no water issues. We asked why Trump was saying that the states water is being redirecting into the ocean and where that idea originated. I cannot speak to that. I dont know what hes getting at. I have no idea McLean said. He added that Californias water policy has had no effect to our water supply. On top of calling climate change a hoax Trump has been critical of the U.S. Forest Services forest fire prevention campaign with Smokey Bear. Kate Poole the senior director of the Natural Resources Defense Councils NRDC water division said its hard to know where to begin in responding to Trumps tweets because theyre fundamentally wrong on many levels. She said the firefighters have plenty of water adding that the fires are a manifestation of the effects of climate change. These fires are what it means in the West to live with higher temperatures less snowpack and more frequent and intense droughts. All of those problems are a result of climate change. Wheres the presidents outrage about that? Wed even settle for a coherent policy to tackle it rather than make it worse Poole told Yahoo News. She said Trump in complaining about water diverted to the Pacific seems to not understand that rivers flow downhill toward the ocean. On the contrary she said California diverts so much water from its natural path and into artificial canals that many miles of rivers have dried up completely. She said this caused ecological collapse in the San Francisco Bay Delta estuary the largest estuary on the west coast of the Americas.	True	False	False	True	True
The US Environmental Protection Agencys main climate change website is undergoing changes to better reflect the agencys new direction under Donald Trump. The announcement made late on Friday evening left empty what was previously the official government site providing comprehensive information on the issue of climate change and global warming. The change came a day before thousands gathered in Washington DC and other US cities to protest about inaction on climate change and hours before the symbolic 100 day mark of the Trump administration. At the marquee climate protest the Peoples Climate March in Washington tens of thousands made their way down Pennsylvania Avenue in sweltering heat on their way to encircle the White House. Organizers said about 300 sister marches or rallies were being held around the country including in Seattle Boston and San Francisco. In Chicago marchers headed from the citys federal plaza to Trump Tower. In Denver marchers were met with a dose of spring snow. Some of the marches drew celebrity attendees including former vice president Al Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio in the capital and senator and former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination Bernie Sanders at an event in Montpelier Vermont. Honored to join Indigenous leaders and native peoples as they fight for climate justice DiCaprio tweeted. Any marchers who used their phones to look at the EPA climate change website would have been greeted with a message from the new administration This page is being updated. As EPA renews its commitment to human health and clean air land and water our website needs to reflect the views of the leadership of the agency said JP Freire an associate administrator for public affairs. Previously the website housed data on greenhouse gas emissions from large polluters and reports on the effects of climate change and its impact on human health. We want to eliminate confusion Freire said by removing outdated language first and making room to discuss how were protecting the environment and human health by partnering with states and working within the law. Information from previous administrations is archived as a link from the EPAs website. The EPA is currently led by Scott Pruitt a former Oklahoma attorney general who has denied that carbon dioxide causes global warming. The Trump administration has called for budget cuts of nearly one third at the EPA and has sought to weaken protections for human health. For instance the White House has proposed cutting funding and regulations regarding lead poisoning prevention and is considering rewriting regulations concerning smog. It has already rolled back a law that prevented coalmining companies from dumping waste in streams. In an op ed piece for the Guardian published on Saturday Sanders made an economic case for a focus on industries meant to ameliorate the effects of climate change rather than those which contribute to it. The senator from Vermont wrote No matter what agenda President Trump and his administration of climate deniers push it is clear that jobs in clean energy like wind and solar are growing much more rapidly than jobs in the coal oil and gas sectors.

It was not hard for Beto ORourke to seem like a champion of green issues during his eye catching Senate campaign in Americas 2018 midterm elections after all he was up against Ted Cruz a climate change denier. Now as the former US congressman vies to be the Democratic candidate to run against Donald Trump in the 2020 race for the White House he faces much closer scrutiny on the subject. Environmental advocates and experts wait to see if as ORourke pivots from an election in a conservative led oil state to a national primary race heavily influenced by left leaning Democratic candidates he will have more latitude and desire to put progressive green policies at the heart of his strategy. He didnt really emphasise climate change and global warming very much when he was running against Ted Cruz but hes got a field that is absolutely filled with people who are making it a campaign item for voters to consider and I think hes going to have to adjust his narrative when hes out on the trail said Robert Forbis an assistant professor of political science at Texas Tech University. Hes going to have to take a pretty strong stand. The seeds of a decisive and urgent approach were visible in his first campaign visits to Iowa in March when ORourke praised the radical climate change led proposals in the Green New Deal citing his home states struggles with extreme weather such as droughts and hurricanes. Storms like Harvey are only going to become more frequent and more severe and more devastating and ultimately theyll compromise the ability to live in a city like Houston Texas he told the audience. ORourke signalled support for reducing the countrys dependence on fossil fuels and investing in green technology to reach net zero emissions. Some will criticise the Green New Deal for being too bold or being unmanageable. Ill tell you what I havent seen anything better that addresses the singular crisis we face a crisis that could at its worst lead to extinction he said. Literally the future of the world depends on us. Cruz held his Senate seat with a narrow win over ORourke last November. The Republican has dismissed climate change as a pseudoscientific theory and wrote an opinion article in 2017 urging Trump to rip up the landmark Paris climate agreement. ORourke meanwhile wrote a blog backing the Paris accord and during six years in Congress he successfully worked to secure federal protection for more than 7000 acres of mountainous land on the outskirts of his native El Paso. The League of Conservation Voters National Environmental Scorecard gives Cruz a lifetime rating of 4 based on his voting record in Congress ORourkes score is 95. Still ORourkes history on environmental issues is more complex than that number might suggest perhaps unsurprisingly for a politician who hails from west Texas. Texas has more installed wind power capacity than any other state and solar power is growing. But the states economy is heavily dependent on the fossil fuel industry which also wields immense political clout. ORourke received 476325 in campaign contributions from oil and gas sources in the 2017 18 election cycle according to the Center for Responsive Politics second nationally to Cruz albeit not from Pacs and a small percentage of his total donations. This helped fuel accusations that ORourke is more of a fossil fuel ally than his lofty rhetoric might imply. The Sludge an investigative website reported last December that ORourkes Senate campaign failed to comply with a pledge not to knowingly accept contributions of more than 200 from the oil and gas industry. ORourke has not yet signed up to the pledge for 2020. Already five declared presidential candidates have officially signed the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge meaning more than a third of declared Democratic candidates have done so said David Turnbull strategic communications director of Oil Change US a group that urges politicians to commit to clean energy. We look forward to the sixth candidate signing the full No Fossil Fuel Money pledge and were hopeful that Beto might be that candidate. ORourkes campaign did not respond to questions about whether he plans to sign the pledge or how his qualified support for natural gas is compatible with the Green New Deal. In 2015 ORourke twice voted to repeal the nationwide ban on exporting crude oil internationally arguing that lifting the prohibition would boost the economy and national security. We have seen the result which is an emergency of booming fossil fuel production here in the United States at precisely the time we need to be urgently moving away from those dirty fuels Turnbull said. Similarly problematic Beto has pointed to fracked natural gas as a potential part of the solution to the climate crisis when the reality is that there is simply no room for new fossil fuel development of any sort including fracked gas. Like with his support for the removal of the crude export ban we hope that when Beto lays out his full climate policies it will reflect the fact that we cant afford any new fossil fuels of any sort including gas. Given Texass critical importance to the environmental and economic future of the country a Texas presidential candidate can deliver a powerful green narrative said Luke Metzger executive director of Environment Texas an advocacy group. I think Texas has a real interesting story to tell in terms of our both being number one in the country for global warming pollution but also being number one for renewable energy he said. To be able to come from Texas and show we can reduce our pollution we can invest in clean energy I think thats a strong message.	True	False	False	True	False
Among the 2020 presidential candidates Cory Booker stands out for his record of advocating for the people who bear the brunt of pollution and toxic waste. Before his presidential run he traveled to Louisiana North Carolina and Alabama to inform a sweeping bill that codifies the federal governments requirement to incorporate the interests of communities of color in environmental regulation.And as the mayor of Newark Booker tackled the citys lead water crisis and industrial pollution. Booker is also one of the few presidential contenders to embrace nuclear energy openlyhis 3 trillion plan to address the climate crisis includes 20 billion in research and development of nuclear technology. This is one major difference between Booker and his opponent Bernie Sanders who has called nuclear power a false solution and actually phases it out in his climate plan. The candidate sat down with Climate Desk in Anacostia Washington D.C. for anexclusive interview a day before the climate strikes taking place around the world. As part of the wide ranging conversation about climate change he explainedhow he squares hissupport for nuclear power with his passion for cleaning up pollution in disadvantaged communities. I didnt come to the United States Senate as a big nuclear guy Booker told Grists executive editor Nikhil Swaminathan on Thursday but when I started looking at the urgency of climate change I saw that over 50 percent of our non carbon producing power right now comes from nuclear. Nuclear has to be a part of the blend Booker added. And to say its not to say youre going to get rid of nuclear really you are handicapping and undermining our ability to get to the ambitious goals we must have. Booker also supports a fee or tax on carbon pollution that would be used in part to fund clean energy and efficiency investments. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is also in favor of price on carbon and explained his plan toClimate Desk this week. I dont think theres any pathway to get to where we need to go without putting some kind of price on carbon he said. A lot of people say well gas is so cheap right now. Yeah its cheap because the price does not include the full cost to humanity. Bookers support for nuclear power and a carbon fee has tempered any praise from the Climate Justice Alliance a network that fears these policies would hurt more than help affected communities. Indeed critics of a carbon tax worry that it would be regressive hurting the poor more than the rich. But Booker argues that rebates and investments in poor communities could help solve that problem. And while historically nuclear power companies have built their plantsand dumped the wastein poor communities of color Booker believes it doesnt have to be that way He points to agreements struck between local and national governments in Canada and Europe as a model for a community process to deal with the waste. Nuclear has proven to be one of the safest ways to advance carbon neutrality he said. Even if it means that we have to phase off it in the future the real pressing challenge right now the threat to our health and our safety and our well being is climate change and that needs to be our driving focus.

The international summit Water and Climate Meeting of the Great Rivers of the World sponsored by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe UNECE and other partners is taking place in Romes Capitol building the Campidoglio from Oct. 23 25. In the Popes written message to the meeting conveyed by the Vaticans Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin the pontiff expressed his concern for water conservation around the world as well as his fervent desire that the threat posed by climate change to our brothers and sisters in the most vulnerable countries will find prompt and effective responses. In another speech at the summit Monday Mr. Karmenu Vella European Commissioner for Environment Maritime Affairs and Fisheries echoed the Popes concerns regarding climate change tying it into the situation of the worlds rivers. We are here today because our climate is under threat Mr. Vella said. Seasonal river flows are changing and floods and droughts are more severe more frequent than ever before. Climate change is raising the temperature of rivers and lakes with major impacts on ecosystems and water quality. These problems are just as real in Europe as they are elsewhere around the globe he asserted. The European Commissioner insisted that the key to addressing the problem of climate change and avoiding a point of no return is to be found in political will. The Paris Agreement reminds us of the need to prepare and adapt and to build up our climate resilience he said. In a major report last week the prestigious UK journal The Lancet suggested that pollution of air and water rather than carbon induced global warming is the real crisis facing the world one being overlooked by environmental activists. The Lancet revealed that pollution related diseases were responsible for an estimated 9 million premature deaths in 2015 or some 15 times more than from all wars and other forms of violence combined. Pollution is not only the largest environmental cause of disease and premature death in the world today the study found but diseases caused by pollution were responsible for roughly 16 percent of all deaths worldwidethree times more deaths than from AIDS tuberculosis and malaria combined and 15 times more than from all wars and other forms of violence. Curiously neither the European Commissioner nor the Pope made any mention to the extraordinary number of deaths caused by water and air pollution preferring instead to focus on the nebulous and ideologically charged notion of anthropogenic climate change. While to date there has not been a single documented case of a person being killed by carbon dioxide related global warming real pollution of air water and land is killing an average of 25000 people every day across the globe. Late last week a report out of Canada suggested that many nations around the world have quietly begun ignoring or abandoning the energy goals outlined by the Paris Climate Accord. According to Lawrence Solomon of Energy Probe a Toronto based environmental organization Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is one of the only signers of the Paris agreement who is actually abiding by the exacting demands of the accord. Solomon proposed that while feigning interest in global warming is politically expedient most people are unconvinced that it poses a real problemunlike the real pollution that is killing millions. In an essay in Fridays Financial Post Solomon said that most signatories are ignoring if not altogether abandoning Paris commitments undoubtedly because voters in large part put no stock in scary global warming scenarios. Trudeau now stands almost alone in sincere support of Paris Solomon wrote. The populist backlash a revulsion at top down governments laden with jet setting politicians landing in posh places to preach restraint to the masses has swept America with Trumps election Great Britain with Brexit much of Europe and Australia. In the process global warming enthusiasts are being swept out he said.	True	False	False	True	True
Radioactive uranium has leaked through a three inch hole in the floor at a nuclear fuel factory in South Carolina contaminating the soil below the plant the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission says. According to the commission the hole goes six feet down into the soil below the Westinghouse factorys concrete floor. While the commission cannot yet say whether the toxic substance has leached into the areas groundwater agency records show that the soil beneath the plant contains 1300 times the amount of uranium typically found in soil. The commission learned of the leak on July 12 and still does not have results on recent groundwater tests which would show whether pollution had washed into the areas water supply. State Department of Health and Environmental Control officials said that the leak does not pose a threat to local water supplies but activists are concerned that Congaree National Park a vast wetland just several miles from the plant may be contaminated. Its a pretty big concern if you have an unknown quantity of material containing uranium leaching into the groundwaterlocal anti nuclear activist Tom Clements told The State. Exposure to uranium can cause kidney failure and can increase a persons risk of cancer. The Westinghouse fuel factory turns uranium into several types of fuel for nuclear reactors. Fuel manufactured at the South Carolina facility is used in nuclear reactors in the US Europe and Asia. Despite boasting that no company is more focused on nuclear fuel reliability Westinghouses South Carolina factory has seen its share of safety foul ups in the past. The plant was shut down two years ago following a uranium build up in an air pollution control device. Last year a hose malfunction sprayed a worker with a toxic solution sending him fleeing to an emergency decontamination shower. In both cases the company resolved to hire new management and overhaul its safety procedures. The factory has been operational for almost five decades and is one of a handful of nuclear fuel factories in the US. At present its federal operating license is up for renewal. The plant is still operating but the section where the hole was discovered has been shut down until repairs can be completed. Like this story? Share it with a friend!	True	False	False	True	True
While scientists continue to warn that climate change poses an existential threat to the planet President Trump wont be talking about it at next years G 7 summit at one of his Florida golf resorts. Climate change will not be on the agenda acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told reporters gathered in the White House briefing room Thursday without elaborating. Mulvaney announced that the G 7 meetings would be held on June 10 and 11 at the Trump National Doral Golf Club just west of Miami an area threatened by sea level rise brought on by climate change. With its low elevations and porous limestone bedrock South Florida is particularly vulnerable to sea level rise. Despite warnings from the scientific community developers including Trump have continued to invest in property that could be underwater before long. Just using the U.S. government projections we could be at 11 to over 13 feet of sea level rise by the end of century Harold Wanless director of the University of Miamis geological sciences department and a leading expert on sea level rise told Yahoo News. Theres only 3 percent of Miami Dade County thats greater than 12 feet above sea level. Trump has labeled climate change a hoax concocted by the Chinese government in an attempt to ruin the U.S. economy but not all members of the Republican Party agree. For the first time in a decade Floridas state Senate held a meeting this week to discuss the impacts of climate change the Miami Herald reported. Theres a younger generation of conservatives in this state that arent as much in denial Republican Sen. Tom Lee who chairs the Committee on Infrastructure and Security told the Herald. Young climate activists like Swedens Greta Thunberg have mobilized students around the world to hold school strikes to protest inaction from world leaders on what they see as a crisis. Something must have changed in the debate that so many young people are speaking up and so many young people are being targeted Thunberg told Yahoo News in response to the mockery her movement has received from leaders like Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. They can sense that we are making an impact. They obviously dont want that. So they are using several methods to mock and hate. While Trump continues to deny the threat that climate change poses to his own properties and the world at large the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco released a report Thursday on the financial risks that global warming poses. It found that properties like Doral that are likely to be underwater in the coming years are already selling for 15 percent less than those where flooding is not a threat. Even more jarring the report warned that climate change poses a threat to the availability of the 30 year mortgage in various vulnerable and highly exposed areas. Thanks to the continued buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due primarily to the use of fossil fuels the rate at which the polar icecaps are melting continues to exceed previous estimates. As of Aug. 1 of this year for instance Greenland had lost a record 12.5 billion tons of ice. This year is on pace to become the second warmest on record and all of the top 10 hottest years on record with the exception of 1998 have occurred since 2005.

In a statement to HuffPost the campaign said it plans to fund renewable energy projects to compensate for the carbon dioxide spewed by the planes and automobiles in which Sanders and his staff will travel while they barnstorm the nation ahead of the Democratic National Convention in July 2020. Bernie Sanders is a champion in the fight for climate justice and like him we know we need to address our emissions through action not just rhetoric Faiz Shakir Sanders campaign manager said in a statement. We are proud to lead the way in the fight against climate change by acting boldly to move our energy system away from fossil fuels and towards sustainable energy sources. Climate change is already a central plank of Sanders second White House bid.In December two months before he announced his candidacy the senator from Vermonthosted a televised town hall with climate scientists and advocates to discuss the crisis. In February he attacked Trump for ignoring climate change in his State of the Union address. During his stump speeches Sanders routinely skewers the fossil fuel industry and promises to enact a Green New Deal if elected. The announcement boosts Sanders bona fides on the issue and gives him a leg up in a crowded field of Democrats putting more attention on climate change than ever before. The move comes a week after the Sanders campaign became the first to unionize. Sanders has also drawn heat recently for his uncertain stance on reparations for the descendants of slaves and for quietly hiring a journalist who frequently attacked his 2020 opponents on Twitter as an adviser. Carbon offsets represent a drop in the bucket on an issue that requires unprecedented systemic change to avert climate disaster. But transportation emissions make up the largest share of the United States climate pollution.Sanders announcement steels the campaign against accusations of hypocrisy often made by Republicans who take an ideological stance against the scientific realities of climate change. The Sanders campaign is buying carbon offsets from Vermont based NativeEnergy the same company Clinton used three years ago. Once dubbedthe celebrities choice in offset providers NativeEnergy provides third party verification of how its offsets are used and boasts a high score as a benefit corporation a sort of LEED certification of for profit companies that pay employees decent wages and provide measurable value to society. Though founded and run by a former utility lawyer the company as its name suggests transferred a majority stake in its ownership to a consortium of Native American tribes in 2005. Carbon emissions from campaign travel first became an issue during the 2004 election when the NRDC Action Fund an affiliate of the Natural Resources Defense Council began raising concerns about the huge amount of fuel candidates burned crisscrossing the country. In 2007 former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack became the first presidential contender to go carbon neutral. John Edwards followed soon after. By 2008 both Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain rushed to put themselves on a carbon diet according to MSNBC. During the 2016 Democratic primary Sanders clashed with Clinton over climate change attacking her support for increased gas drilling in a heated debate. After Clinton clinched the nomination the issue disappeared without a single question asked during three debates between Clinton and her Republican opponent Donald Trump. We are proud to lead the way in the fight against climate change by acting boldly to move our energy system away from fossil fuels and towards sustainable energy sources. Nearly every major declared contender for the Democratic nomination has expressed support for the Green New Deal a movement calling for a sweeping national industrial policy that zeroes out greenhouse gases over a decade guarantees clean energy jobs to millions and puts the country on course to generate as close to 100 percent of its electricity from renewables as possible in a decade. In a first Washington Gov. Jay Inslee is centering his entire campaign on climate change vowing to make it his priority if nominated. He joined Sanders Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand D N.Y. Sen. Elizabeth Warren D Mass. and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard D Hawaii in signing the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge an oath promising to reject donations from the oil gas and coal companies and their executives. The newfound attention on climate change comes after the United Nations stark warning in October that world governments have roughly a decade to halve global emissions or face an average temperature increase of at least 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit about half a degree Celisus more than what the world experiences today. Warming beyond that level is forecast to cause catastrophic flooding droughts and extreme weather with economic damages topping 54 trillion.	True	False	False	True	True
An Environmental Protection Agency website teaching kids about acid rain instructs children using cartoon animals to avoid cars limit air conditioning and to buy cars that dont make the air as dirty. The EPAs Acid Rain Kids Site features the story of Lucy Lake a lake living in the mountains and the sick animals around her. On a normal day the plants and animals at Lucy Lake have enough food and clean water to keep them healthy reads the EPA site. The wind carries pure air and the rain comes down clear and clean. But lately Lucy Lake and her friends have not been feeling very well reads the story. Kids then see a cartoon depiction of a browned sweating sick tree a frowning lake and a fish that appears to be gasping for air accompanied by the following text All the plants and animals of the forest gather together to talk about the problem. Why are we sick? asks Frannie Frog. What is doing this to us? asks Sammy Spruce. What can we do? asks Lucy Lake. No one has any answers. Thankfully two people on a hike walk by. A cartoon frog stops the hikers to tell them about the dangers of acid rain. The creatures of the forest gather around and tell the hikers about their problems. We are hungry Were tired and weak Our babies are sick the plants and animals complain. Can you help us? they all ask. The hikers both nod their heads. Yes one hiker says. I think I know what the problem is he says. Its acid rain. One of the hikers then explains where acid rain comes from citing the danger of pollution caused by power plants. Acid rain comes from chemicals in the air or pollution says the hiker in the story. A lot of this pollution comes from power plants that burn fossil fuels like coal to make electricity. We use this electricity to make our lights and our TVs work. Pollution also comes from the cars and trucks people drive. This pollution also causes acid rain. With the help of the plants and animals the hikers then make a list of things that will stop the acid rain from killing the cute cartoon creatures. The list includes turning the lights off when leaving a room not using air conditioning as much riding buses and trains to avoid cars and buying vehicles that dont make the air as dirty. The story ends unsurprisingly with the hikers saving the forest and all its creatures including Sammy Spruce Wendy Wind and a gigantic smiling raindrop. The EPA website contains an Acid Rain Activity Book that includes several acid rain themed games for kids. It also includes a Message for Adults Acid rain is a problem that affects us all The message to spread however is that we can all make a difference and help reduce the presence of acid rain. We hope this Web site will provide younger children with basic information about acid rain and help them form a foundation of knowledge about and an interest for a variety of environmental issues. Its unclear whether acid rain is still a noteworthy problem. Some environmentalists claim it is but others including the Environmental Defense Fund a left wing organization calling for cap and trade policies to battle climate change says problems related to acid rain pollution have been largely been solved.

TANGIER ISLAND Va. Reuters This summer a delegation of Republican climate activists visited Tangier Island a speck of grassland in Virginia's Chesapeake Bay to try to convince its 450 residents to take climate change seriously. At a dinner attended by island residents Aug. 2 the activists from RepublicEn headed by former Republican Congressman Bob Inglis laid out the stakes The sea level is rising and some scientists estimate that within decades the island already suffering severe erosion will need to be abandoned. The people of Tangier Island were used to this kind of message. Former Vice President Al Gore a prominent Democratic climate activist had given the same speech to islanders three days earlier. They were also used to rejecting it. We'll talk to everybody said James Eskridge mayor of the mainly Republican island community. But they're not going to change many minds here. Residents he said do not believe in climate change they want a new sea wall to prevent erosion not a lecture about saving the world with solar panels. Tangier Island's steadfast rejection of climate change reflects the rigidity of American opinions about global warming often defined along political party lines. ReutersIpsos polling shows more than a third of Americans mainly Republicans reject the scientific consensus that climate change is driven by human activity. Less than a third of Americans believe global warming poses an imminent threat to the United States. These views barely budged after a series of devastating hurricanes this summer. That rift in opinion has proven to be a headwind for U.S. lawmakers seeking broad solutions to stem climate change like imposing a cost on carbon emissions or encouraging cleaner renewable energy technologies to replace fossil fuels. And while conservatives have long been skeptical about climate change doubters have a powerful new ally U.S. President Donald Trump. He has called climate change a hoax and has started withdrawing the United States from a global pact to combat it citing what he calls the huge economic cost. Eskridge told Reuters Trump called him in June after seeing a report about severe erosion problems on the island telling him not to worry about sea level rise. I believe man plays a part in it but not to the extent that others have been talking about that's what me and Donald Trump were talking about Eskridge said. 'WE'RE LOOKING TO STAY' An Army Corps of Engineers study in 2015 showed Tangier has lost two thirds of its mass since 1850 because of erosion a process scientists say is being exacerbated by climate change. Journalists and politicians now view the island as a symbol of the climate crisis. Tangier residents are happy with the attention but believe their problem is simpler. A sea wall built on one side of the island in the late 1980s has prevented the land behind it from eroding they say so another sea wall is the answer. We're not looking to have our light bills cheaper we're looking to stay here said Deborah Pruitt 57 who works at the island's museum where printouts of news reports about the island are displayed on a wall. Conservative climate activists like Rob Sisson of ConservAmerica and Mitch Hescox of the Evangelical Environmental Network said the rejection of climate change by Tangier residents is not surprising their groups often have trouble convincing fellow Republicans global warming is a real issue. Often they say people object to the idea that humans could possibly change the climate even if they wanted to. Florida Congresswoman Ileana Ros Lehtinen one of a handful of Republicans to publicly declare a belief in climate change said she has a strategy for getting fellow Republicans to think of solutionsI've found that the best way ... is to not dwell on the causes she said in an email.

California Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown issued an executive order Monday mandating carbon neutrality by 2045 then ordering the state to maintain net negative emissions thereafter. Browns executive order came the same day hesigned into lawa bill mandating California get 100 percent of its electricity from renewables and zero carbon energy sources. Brown is also preparing to host a global warming activist summit Wednesday. California is committed to doing whatever is necessary to meet the existential threat of climate change Brown said Monday. But have no illusions California and the rest of the world have miles to go before we achieve zero carbon emissions. Brown is right in one sense. California does have miles to go to meet Browns executive order because it relies on magical thinking and science fiction according to experts. Existing executive orders call for California to cut greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 and state law requires emissions to be cut 40 percent by 2030. However thats not enough to meet the goals of the Paris climate accord according to United Nations models. What Brownorderedis not just reducing emissions but instead implied sucking more greenhouse gas out of the air than human activities in his state put up and not just for electricity. Browns order applies to the entire economy including transportation and agriculture. So what does negative emissions mean in practice? Well no one really knows but experts have put forward ideas to suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Browns office said negative emissions would be achieved through increased carbon sequestration in forests soils and other natural landscapes according to itspress release. But how would this even work?RELATED A New Report Details How Nonprofits Are Funneling Millions To Democratic Governors To Further Their Global Warming Agenda Scientists have also proposed technologies to literally suck carbon dioxide from the air and store it underground or in the ocean. Experts have also suggested reforestation ocean fertilization and whats known as enhanced weathering. Enhanced weathering is the rather hilarious idea that one can use rocks to in effect store CO2 emissions. In theory the rocks would react with CO2 and water to form an alkaline solution that leaks into the ocean. However all of these proposals remains magical thinking at this point according to aneditorialin the journal Nature. Enhanced weathering for example would require an area about the size of Texas of US agricultural land every year just to soak up 13 of the annual global emissions from agriculture according to Nature. Another proposed technology thats cited by the IPCC is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage BECCS. This is basically removing CO2 through growing plants which are then burned for energy. The emissions are then captured and stored underground. Of course BECCS is another magical solution thats baked into the IPCCs models of what needs to be done to limit future global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. University of Colorado professor Roger Pielke Jr. recentlypublished a paperon the problems with the UNs use of BECCS to sell the Paris climate accord. Carbon dioxide removal at massive scale is science fiction like a light saber incredible but not real Pielke wrote. Yet BECCS plays a very real role in todays climate policy arena Pielke wrote by helping to maintain the climate policy envelope and save us from having to do the enormously difficult and uncomfortable work of thinking how we might go about addressing accumulating carbon dioxide in the atmosphere differently than we have since the 1980s and 90s. If nothing else full implementation of BECCS at scale would require the use of a global land area one and a half times the size of India Pielke wrote about the staggering environmental cost of negative emissions technology. Indeed the European Academies Science Advisory Councilconcludedin early 2018 that negative emissions technologies offer only limited realistic potential to remove carbon from the atmosphere and not at the scale envisaged in some climate scenarios.

Billionaire Tom Steyer is keeping a low profile with respect to his support for the Democratic Partys Green New Deal. Its an unusual position for one of the environmentalist movements biggest advocates. Steyer has stayed mum on an all encompassing climate resolution that promises to completely remake the American economy. Hes given faint praise for the GND in a tweet and a few sparse press statements but the Democratic megadonor is instead focusing on impeaching the president. Theclimate resolution which was rolled out by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez on Feb. 7 callsfor 10 year national mobilizations toward a series of goals aimed at fighting global warming. A separate fact sheetclaimsthe plan would mobilize every aspect of American society. Steyers relative inaction comes as critics slam the GNDs coming out party. Ocasio Cortezs office provided NPR the GND resolution and its accompanying FAQ document that laid out its goals namely to move America to 100 clean and renewable energy within 10 years. The FAQ document dump turned into a millstone around Democrats proverbial necks. Among other things the document claimed that Americans must upgrade or replace every building in US for state of the art energy efficiency if they are to rid the country and world of all forms of pollution and greenhouse gases. It also stated that the GND would provide benefits for people unwilling to work. Ocasio Cortezs staff was forced to ding the document from the website and clarify the lawmakers position. The drama unfolded less than a day after the Feb. 7 rollout of the now beleaguered deal. Steyer for his part issued a tweet on the day of the rollout cheering the New York Democrats ambitious play. A real solution proposed in Washington? About time!! Lets make the liars and deniers explain why this doesnt HAVE to happen he told his Twitter followers at the time. Steyer didnt mention the GND again until several days later when Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts published a statement on his website noting Steyers support. Our society needs to turn dramatically and immediately towards the shared goals of environmental justice broad based prosperity and health. The Green New Deal is that turnSteyer said in the Feb. 13 statement. Steyers political action group NextGen America has not responded to The Daily Caller News Foundations request for comment. Some critics believe it makes sense why the former hedge fund manager is staying mum. Christopher Horner a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute told TheDCNF that Steyers reticence to leap into the fray is probably a smart tactic given the GDNs controversy. I think I would avoid wide circulation too Horner said adding that the same people who couldnt create a healthcare website apparently cant even properlypostto a website. He often engages in legal battles against attorneys who sue energy companies over climate change. Other analysts shared similar sentiments. Hes calculating. Its not overly popular EE Legal President Craig Richardson told TheDCNF referring to the GND which received waives of support from various Democratic presidential candidates. Hes all in on climate program. Its a trial balloon so hes smart enough not to jump into that right away. Its really not politically expedient to come all the way out for it he said of Steyers reticence. Richardsons group is also on the front lines in battles against anti oil activists. Steyer is plowing another 6 million into what some Democratic leaders worry is an ill fated attempt to impeach the president. He decided not to run against President Donald Trump in January citing concerns about his business dealings and past fossil fuel investments.

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrives at a meeting of the National Space Council in Chantilly Va. on Oct. 5 2017. Photo Andrew HarnikAP President Trumps dismissal of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson Tuesday morning fulfilled a long held wish for climate advocates but they fear his replacement CIA Director Mike Pompeo will be even worse. Tillerson joined Exxon in 1975 and rose through the ranks over the decades. He was CEO and chairman of ExxonMobil from 2006 until he joined the Trump administration in 2017. That Trump would nominate a lifelong oilman to succeed John Kerry who led the U.S. through the Paris climate negotiations of late 2015 as the nations top diplomat resulted in predictable and fierce pushback. During his confirmation hearing in January 2017 however Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he thought the United States should stay in the Paris Agreement which strives to reduce global warming to 2C 3.6F. He also suggested that a carbon tax may be the best way to limit the greenhouse gas emissions driving global warming. Pompeo on the other hand identified with the tea party and represented Kansass Fourth Congressional District from 2011 to 2017. He received more financial backing from Koch Industries an energy and natural resources conglomerate than any other candidate in the 2010 elections 80000. In fact according to the Center for Responsive Politics a bipartisan research group that tracks the effect of lobbying on elections and policy Pompeo has received more money from Koch interests than any other House member. In just four election cycles 2010 2012 2014 2016 he received the following 335000 from Koch Industries employees which includes 92000 from the Koch family 69000 from theKoch Industries PAC 417175 from Americans for Prosperity an advocacy group funded by the Kochs and 87532 from other organizations with substantial funding by the Koch brothers. And Pompeo turned to the Koch brothers who actively oppose climate change legislation for money long before running for office. In the late 90s Koch Industries invested in an aerospace company Pompeo founded with fellow West Point alumni. He sold his interest in Thayer Aerospace in 2006 and became president of Sentry International which produces and sells oil field equipment. In short even though environmentalists adamantly opposed Tillerson they do not expect anything positive for the climate from Pompeo. Jake Schmidt the international program director at the Natural Resources Defense Council released the following statement Replacing the man from Big Oil with a first class climate denier simply goes from bad to worse. This shuffling of the deck chairs will ensure that Washington continues to bring up the rear when it comes to international action to combat dangerous climate change. Tiernan Sittenfeld senior vice president of government affairs for the League of Conservation Voters said in a statement that Pompeos nomination is profoundly disturbing but not unexpected. Though not surprising this is extremely troubling. Climate change is one of the most critical threats facing our nation and world and the secretary of state has a huge responsibility to make sure it is addressed by the global community she said. With a history of questioning the science of climate change a close relationship with the polluter Koch brothers and lifetime LCV score of 4 Mike Pompeo has no business becoming the next secretary of state. Naomi Ages the climate director of Greenpeace USA was similarly perturbed. Donald Trump has now somehow picked someone even worse than Rex Tillerson to run the State Department. Greenpeace has been opposed to Tillerson as secretary of state from the moment he was nominated and we continue to believe that the U.S. government cannot and should not be run by fossil fuel industry flunkies Ages said in a statement. Mike Pompeo though is uniquely unqualified to be secretary of state in an entirely different way than Rex Tillerson was. In addition to being a climate denier like his predecessor Pompeo is Koch brothers shill who will denigrate the United States reputation abroad and make us vulnerable to threats at home. Rep. Barbara Lee D Calif. also took issue with Pompeos past statements on climate change.	False	False	False	True	True
Donald Trump is moving to formally exit the Paris climate agreement making the United States the only country in the world that will not participate in the pact as global temperatures are set to rise 3C and worsening extreme weather will drive millions into poverty. The paperwork sent by the US government to withdraw begins a one year process for exiting the deal agreed to at the UN climate change conference in Paris in 2015. The Trump administration will not be able to finalize its exit until a day after the presidential election in November 2020. The secretary of state Mike Pompeo announced the development on Monday afternoon saying the agreement would be an unfair economic burden imposed on American workers businesses and taxpayers and that the US has already reduced its heat trapping emissions. But organizers of local city and state efforts to curb the crisis across America say the US is still trying to play a role in fighting the climate crisis despite the actions of the federal government. Carl Pope vice chair of the group Americas Pledge said its members who are vowing to keep fighting the climate emergency produce more than half the countrys heat trapping emissions and represent about 70 of the US gross domestic product. Another organization the US Climate Alliance includes the governors of 25 states representing 55 of the US population. In the Paris agreement the US agreed to cut its heat trapping pollution at least 26 below 2005 levels by 2025. Dozens of countries are also pursuing goals to reach net zero emissions by 2050. But they represent only about 11 of the worlds climate footprint and exclude the biggest emitters China the US and India. Staying on par with those more advanced countries would require the US government to eliminate pollution from coal and natural gas powered electricity plants transportation manufacturing facilities and agriculture. Local action by itself is not likely to be enough. We dont think its likely just with the states we have we think we need the whole country to be moving together Pope said. Jean Su energy director with the Center for Biological Diversitys Climate Law Institute said America is the number one historical contributor to the climate emergency wreaking havoc in burning California the flooded Southeast and the rest of the world. The next president must repay this extraordinary climate debt by rapidly moving America to 100 clean energy and financing the decarbonization of the Global South Su said referring to the developing world. In addition the Trump administration has also pulled US funding commitments to help the developing world cut pollution. John Kerry and Chuck Hagel president Barack Obamas secretaries of state and defense respectively in a Washington Post op ed called it a dark day for America. Climate change is already affecting every sector and region of the United States as hundreds of top scientists from 13 federal agencies made clear in a report the White House itself released last year they said. The past five years were the warmest ever recorded. Without steep pollution reductions climate change will risk tens of thousands of US lives every year by the end of the century. They called the Paris agreement a start not a finish line but the best ignition switch the world could agree on to spark international cooperation on this critical issue. Senator Tom Carper the top Democrat on the Senate environment panel said Once again President Trump is abandoning our global allies for the sake of misplaced political gain. Now America stands alone nearly 200 countries have joined this global commitment to fighting climate change even global pariahs like North Korea and civil war torn countries like Syria. Carper said Trump is abandoning tremendous economic opportunity and public health benefits. Trumphas alternately ignored or denied the climate crisis. His agencies are nixing regulations for power plants and cars and bolstering fossil fuels whenever possible. He promised to widespread dismay to exit the Paris agreement during his campaign. The Democratic 2020 election frontrunners challenging Trump have all said they would set the country on a path to neutralize its climate pollution by 2050. Nate Hultman director of the University of Marylands center for global sustainability and lead author of this years Americas Pledge report pointed to new laws in New Mexico Nevada Washington Maine New York Washington DC and Puerto Rico for 100 clean energy targets. Hawaii and California already had such laws. Together they represent 16 of the nations electricity more than doubling the share from 2018 he said. Another way to think about it is that Trumps decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement is supported in reality by only about 30 of the economy and 35 of the population Hultman said. Even once the US withdraws the country can participate as an observer in international climate negotiations. But despite the efforts of subnational governments recent analysis shows the US is still far off track from its commitments regardless of whether Trump pulled out. The US is also far from neutralizing climate emissions by the middle of the century which as many experts say will be necessary for all countries in order to avert the worst of the crisis. We can still get there with a serious shift in policy in the coming years said Kate Larsen director of Rhodiums international energy and climate research.	False	False	False	True	False
New U.S. Climate Assessment Forecasts Dire Effects On Economy Health The Trump administration released a major climate assessment on Black Friday the culmination of years of research by the country's top climate scientists. It's well over 1000 pages and touches on a daunting range of topics. President Trump said Monday that he has read parts of it. It's fine he told reporters at the White House although he said he doesn't believe the report's assessment that climate change will cause devastating economic impacts for the U.S. The report is required by Congress every four years and is issued by 13 federal agencies and the U.S. Global Change Research Program. This one marks the most detailed and blunt assessment yet of the dangers of unchecked global warming. Climate change is happening here and now co author Katherine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University told Weekend Edition Saturday. It is affecting all of us no matter where we live. And the more climate changes the more serious and even more dangerous the impacts will become. Here are some key points. Some parts of the U.S. economy could suffer hundreds of billions of dollars in annual losses by the end of the century unless global greenhouse gas emissions are substantially reduced the report finds. Already there's the impact of increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather events. The report notes that large wildfires are more frequent and that the areas burned by lightning ignited fires are expected to increase by at least 30 percent by 2060. The costs for fighting fires and forest management are on the rise see chart. But there are other less obvious risks. Don't see the graphic above? Click here Increasing rain and humidity could cause agricultural productivity to fall in the Midwest and warming oceans will hurt fisheries. Along the coasts more severe flooding threatens billions of dollars' worth of property and infrastructure which in turn could affect the economic stability of local governments businesses and the broader economy. Extreme weather events could also cause price spikes and interrupt international trade. As an example the report notes that flooding in Thailand in 2011 disrupted production of Ford and Honda vehicles in the U.S. and cost a U.S. based hard drive manufacturer 199 million in losses. Again the rise of extreme events like wildfires floods and storm surges poses the most immediate danger to public health and well being. The report finds that with continued warming heat related deaths will increase. The warming climate and more frequent and intense rain might also expand the range of ticks and mosquitoes exposing more people to diseases like West Nile dengue fever chikungunya and Lyme. Climate change could also worsen harmful ozone levels and air pollution. That could send more people to the hospital for aggravated asthma and respiratory or cardiovascular problems and could even increase premature deaths. As with so many climate impacts the report notes that those most at risk include children the elderly and low income communities. U.S. infrastructure was not built for these changes Much of America's infrastructure is already aging and deteriorating and it is taking a pounding from extreme weather. In some places more intense rain and saltwater intrusion have led to dam failures bridge and road closures and power outages. Heavier downpours can also overwhelm sewer systems causing untreated water to flow into rivers. In the West prolonged drought has forced utilities to cut back on electricity production from hydropower. Extreme heat and higher demand can also raise the risk of power outages. The report notes that power outages can affect drinking water treatment among many other services people take for granted. Intense rain flooding and heat can also hurt the nation's vast network of transportation shutting down major highways and coastal airports and halting freight movement. The report like most climate studies offers different scenarios for how fast the climate will change and by how much. The bigger the change the greater the consequences for everything from heat waves to hurricanes. The White House issued a statement criticizing the report as largely based on the most extreme scenario for emissions of greenhouse gases. The report is in fact based mostly on two scenarios One is the most severe view in which little or no effort is made to lower emissions. However it also uses a more moderate scenario one that sees more aggressive actions to reduce emissions than are currently underway less fossil fuel use for example or more efficient vehicles and buildings. And for some of its chapters the report considers a third far rosier future where emissions are drastically reduced and even where greenhouse gases are pulled back out of the atmosphere. Effects on people and the economy are considerably less dire under these scenarios than in the most severe one. Some communities are already adapting The good news in this dire report is that scores of local and state governments are taking action to lower their own carbon emissions and cope with climate impacts. Some of those impacts will get worse still no matter what as they are locked in due to historical emissions. But the report makes clear that changes today can make a big difference. It's absolutely not too late to take action says Brenda Ekwurzel a co author and senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The report states that more than half the projected damages of coastal property are estimated to be avoidable through well timed adaptation measures. But Ekwurzel cautions that we can't merely adapt our way out of this mess. The cost of adaptation could be quite high and it may never be enough she says. But costs will really start skyrocketing if we don't start reining in emissions.	True	False	False	True	True
LONDONSEOUL Reuters Temperatures are likely to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052 if global warming continues at its current pace and if the world fails to take rapid and unprecedented measures to stem the increase a U.N. report said on Monday. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC met last week in Incheon South Korea to finalize the report prepared at the request of governments in 2015 when a global pact to tackle climate change was agreed. The report is seen as the main scientific guide for government policymakers on how to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement. The Paris pact aims to limit global average temperature rise to well below 2C above pre industrial levels while seeking to tighten the goal to 1.5C. There has already been a rise of 1C since the mid 1800s as industrialization lifted emissions of carbon dioxide CO2 the main greenhouse gas blamed for climate change. A rise of 1.5C would still carry climate related risks for nature and mankind but the risks would be lower than a rise of 2C the report summary said. Meeting the 1.5C limit required rapid far reaching and unprecedented change in land and energy use industry buildings transport and cities it said adding temperatures would be 1.5C higher between 2030 and 2052 at the current pace. The targets agreed in Paris on cutting emissions would not be enough even if there were larger and more ambitious cuts after 2030 it said. To contain warming at 1.5C manmade global net carbon dioxide emissions would need to fall by about 45 percent by 2030 from 2010 levels and reach net zero by mid century. Any additional emissions would require removing CO2 from the air. Limiting warming to 1.5C is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics but doing so would require unprecedented changes said Jim Skea co chair of the IPCC working group which assesses climate change mitigation. The summary said renewable energy would need to supply 70 to 85 percent of electricity by 2050 to stay within a 1.5C limit compared with about 25 percent now. Using carbon capture and storage CCS technology the share of gas fired power would need to be cut to 8 percent and coal to between 0 and 2 percent. There was no mention of oil in this context in the summary. If the average global temperature temporarily exceeded 1.5C additional carbon removal techniques would be required to return warming to below 1.5C by 2100. But the report said the efficacy of measures such as planting forests bioenergy use or capturing and storing CO2 were unproven at a large scale and carried some risks. Steps like reflecting incoming solar radiation back into space were not assessed because of the uncertainties about using such technology the report said. It said keeping the rise in temperature to 1.5C would mean sea levels by 2100 would be 10 cm lower than if the warming was 2C the likelihood of an Arctic Ocean free of sea ice in summer would be once per century not at least once a decade and coral reefs would decline by 70 90 percent instead of being virtually wiped out. The report shows that we only have the slimmest of opportunities remaining to avoid unthinkable damage to the climate system that supports life as we know it said Amjad Abdulla the IPCC board member and chief negotiator for the alliance of small island states.

Salvage expert Nick Sloane is the brains behind a scheme to tow a massive iceberg from Antarctica to Cape Town to alleviate the South African city's drought AFP PhotoRODGER BOSCH Cape Town AFP It is a plan as crazy as the situation is desperate towing an iceberg from Antarctica to Cape Town to supply fresh water to a city in the grip of drought. Earlier this year Cape Town came within weeks of shutting off all its taps and forcing residents to queue for water rations at public standpipes. The cut off was narrowly averted as people scrambled to reduce their water usage and Autumn rains saved the day. But the threat is expected to return to the coastal South African city again next year and beyond. The idea sounds crazy admits maverick salvage expert Nick Sloane the brains behind the tow an iceberg scheme. But if you look at the fine details it is not so crazy. Sloane suggests wrapping the iceberg in a textile insulation skirt to stop it melting and using a supertanker and two tugboats to drag it 2000 kilometres 1200 miles towards Cape Town using prevailing ocean currents. The iceberg carefully selected by drones and radiography scans would be about one kilometre in length 500 metres across and up to 250 metres deep with a flat tabletop surface. Melted water could be gathered each day using collection channels and a milling machine to create ice slurry producing 150 million litres of usable water every day for a year. Sloane's idea might be dismissed as mere fantasy. But the 56 year old Zambian South African has a reputation for taking on the impossible after he re floated the giant Costa Concordia cruise ship that capsized in 2012 off the Tuscan island of Giglio killing 32 people one of the world's largest and most complex maritime salvage operations. Icebergs are made of the purest freshwater on earth the founder of Sloane Marine Ltd said earnestly. Thousands break off every year. Mother Nature has been teasing mankind with this for a long time saying 'this is here'. He estimates it would cost 100 million 86 million euros to haul an iceberg on a journey that could take up to three months and another 50 60 million to harvest the water for one year as it melts. In Russia they have pushed icebergs away from oil installations but small ones they are about half a million tons. Here we are talking about 100 million tons said Sloane. To tackle the drought Cape Town has enacted measures ranging from building seawater desalination plants to issuing strict instructions to only flush toilets when necessary. But whether Cape Town authorities will be persuaded to embrace the iceberg project is unclear. At this stage it appears to us that in fact the groundwater or desalination options are cheaper or at least equal cost price said Cape Town's deputy mayor Ian Neilson. There are also questions on how the water from the iceberg will be channelled into the city's distribution system. Another problem is that there is no guarantee that by the time the iceberg is hauled to Cape Town it will still be able to produce the promised volumes of water. Sloane's plan is to tow the giant iceberg some 150 km further north to South Africa's St. Helena Bay where the cold Benguela Current keeps water at around zero degrees Celsius. Once there the iceberg could be anchored in an old submarine channel suggests Sloane. As the iceberg melts water will be collected each day pumped into tankers and driven to Cape Town. It won't sort out Cape Town's crisis but it will be about 20 to 30 percent of their annual needs said Sloane. The project is crazy no question said Olav Orheim a Norwegian glaciologist with four decades of experience who is working on a similar project for Saudi Arabia. Never has such a large iceberg been towed indeed the towing of ice to supply drinking water would be a first and it is unknown if it would withstand ocean currents or simply fracture in transit. But said Orheim it was no longer unrealistic because we know so much more now than when we started this kind of research 40 years ago. It is a high risk project but also one which may have a very high reward at the end said Orheim. For Wolfgang Foerg the chief executive of Swiss company Water Vision which has teamed up with Sloane the project has huge potential in the face of ever more frequent drought. As for Sloane he is ready for the green light. If they tell us to go now we can have it here by Easter 2019 he said.	False	False	False	True	True
Climate Report Warns Of Extreme Weather Displacement Of Millions Without Action Some of the world's top climate scientists have concluded that global warming is likely to reach dangerous levels unless new technologies are developed to remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC says pledges from the world's governments to reduce greenhouse gases made in Paris in 2015 aren't enough to keep global warming from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius 2.7 degrees F above pre industrial temperatures. That was the Paris agreement's most ambitious target a 2 degree C rise was established as a more practical goal. But even with a 1.5 degree C increase the world can expect serious changes to weather sea levels agriculture and natural eco systems according to a report issued Monday following an IPCC meeting in South Korea. Limiting warming to 1.5 C is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics says Jim Skea of Imperial College London one of the authors of the report but doing so would require unprecedented changes. Scientists and climate researchers have long doubted that the 1.5 degree C goal was practical or economically feasible. Their new report lays out the difficulty in stark detail it would require a 40 50 percent reduction in emissions by 2030 global emissions are currently rising. It would mean a carbon neutral world one with no net additional greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by 2050. They now say that scenario is very unlikely without new measures and technologies to remove greenhouse gases from the air some of which have yet to be invented. We have a monumental task in front of us says co author Natalie Mahowald from Cornell University but it is not impossible. In 50 years she says it's going to be very different. This is our chance to decide what that road will look like. The IPCC report holds out hope that if the global climate warms more than the 1.5 degree or even the 2 degree target this overshoot could be reversed with carbon removal techniques. It suggests numerous ways to take carbon dioxide CO2 the leading greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere. Growing more forests which absorb CO2 is one tactic. But research shows that the amount of land needed for that would be formidable. Another possibility involves burning biomass to make electricity instead of using fossil fuels. Currently about 1 percent of electricity in the U.S. is made that way using things like waste wood and agricultural material. It's expensive however. Crops like corn are now turned into ethanol but that raises food prices. To be economical the biomass would have to be agricultural waste or special crops like switchgrass that don't compete with food crops. There are experimental methods now that can take CO2 directly out of the air after which it could be buried. But billions of tons of CO2 would have to come out and these techniques now cost as much as 1000 to extract a single ton of CO2 according to Howard Herzog an engineer at MIT who specializes in these carbon capture technologies. CO2 is a tiny percentage of the air Herzog likens the technique to removing 400 CO2 marbles from a pile of one million marbles. The best way to remove CO2 from the air he says in his book Carbon Capture is to not release it into the air in the first place. Herzog calls most of these extraction ideas more of a hope than a reality. He says it comes down to cost and it's a lot cheaper to take it out now by reducing emissions than in the future. But most governments now fear the cost of a global overhaul of the world's energy economy in the short time needed to meet the Paris climate goals. As the report concludes There is no simple answer to the questions of whether it is feasible to limit warming to 1.5 C and to adapt to the consequences.... However it does make clear the consequences of warming above that level more heat waves more severe rain and snow events higher sea levels damage to agriculture and displacement of millions of people.

Celebrities often claim to be concerned about the environment usually without changing their lavish lifestyles or pollution. During a telethon fundraiser on Sept. 12 for Harvey and Irma relief celebrities like Beyonce linked manmade climate change to the hurricanes. But the very stars participating in the telethon burn massive amounts of carbon dioxide by their extravagant lifestyles just as Daily Mail reported on Sept. 13. The effects of climate change are playing out around the world every day Beyonce claimed in a pre recorded message. But if Beyonce and other celebrities were so concerned about a supposed connection between the devastation and climate change why have they continued to ignore their own carbon gluttony? The A list celebrities who starred in the telethon for those affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma have clocked up hundreds of thousands of air miles which have fuelled rising temperatures and helped create devastating storms Daily Mail foreign reporter Gareth Davies wrote. Climate change activists often claim carbon emissions from driving and flying are a significant cause of man made warming. Davies found that in just the past year Leonardo DiCaprio George Clooney Justin Bieber and Beyonce produced at least 52.11 tons of carbon dioxide with their air travel alone. Biebers jet setting had the highest carbon footprint an egregious 22 tons. In comparison the average Americans total carbon footprint is 20 tons. According to Davies if driving pollution from their concerts or films and the electric in their homes are considered the total was likely to be astronomic. Although DiCaprio is a self proclaimed environmentalist he continued to live an incompatible lifestyle of massive carbon emissions. For the 2017 Oscars DiCaprio and a fellow actor flew an someone 15000 miles round trip to tidy their eyebrows. The actor also asked if are we too late to stop climate change and blasted the supposed corporate greed of the coal oil and gas industries in January 2016. All while owning multiple mansions vacationing on yachts and flying thousands of miles in private jets. Even Forbes noted DiCaprio himself is one of those big polluters which diminishes his moral authority to lecture others on reducing their own carbon emissions in March 2016. Forbes also challenged DiCaprios claim that he only produces 11 tons of carbon annually. Clooney criticized global warming skeptics as stupid and ridiculous in 2013. Despite his rhetoric on climate change however the actor and his wife Amal owned eight homes as of March 2016 according to the Daily Mail. Other celebrities like Julia Roberts are also eco hypocrites. In 2011 she co wrote a USA Today op ed demanding cleaner cooking stoves in third world countries to combat climate change. Yet she has owned five homes and a private jet all at the same time. More than 45 celebrities took part in the fundraiser which brought in more than 44 million. All of the celebrities most likely live far more lavish carbon burning lives than average Americans.	True	False	False	True	False
As the Trump White House continues its cleanup of the mess foreign and domestic left behind by the Obama administration it should toss out a little noticed document that entangles the U.S. in some of the worst schemes ever cooked up by U.N. bureaucrats and their cronies in the global environmental movement. On September 16 2016 the Obama EPA entered into a memorandum of understanding MOU with the United Nations Environmental Programme UNEP. Concluded just a few weeks before the 2016 presidential election the MOU bears the signature for the U.S. of then EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. In the document UNEP and the Obama EPA vow to consolidate further develop and intensify their cooperation and effectiveness to achieve their common goals and objectives in the field of the environment. And therein lies the problem. For the common goals and objectives shared by the U.N. body and the Obama administration are specifically crafted to hamstring American fossil fuel energy development promote an assortment of politically fashionable but otherwise uncompetitive green technologies and products and perpetuate the deplorable living conditions in the worlds poorest countries. An Instrument of the Paris Climate Accord The document was signed nine months after the adoption of the U.N. sponsored Paris climate accord and the wording of the MOU leaves little doubt that it was seen as an instrument to underscore Americas commitment to curtail its production and use of energy in the name of combatting climate change. Thus UNEP and the Obama EPA agreed to cooperate on responses to climate change including mitigating greenhouse gas emissions reducing short lived climate forcers and supporting adaptation and resilience to climate change. Taking these and similar steps the MOU says will enable the advance toward green economies and resource efficient societies through collaborative activities to promote and support sustainable consumption and production. In truth green economies are those with taxpayer subsidized and government mandated renewable energy primarily wind and solar. And what constitutes sustainable consumption and production is in the eyes of the beholding bureaucrat empowered either by the administrative regulatory state or by legislation adopted at the behest of deep pocketed special interests. All of this is to be pursued through jointly held symposia seminars workshops study tours collaborative research and development projects exchanges and training programs and other forms of cooperation that strengthen the bonds between UNEP and the U.S. Under the MOU each side is to name a Senior Coordinator to oversee the holding of regular joint meetings on matters of common interest. To make sure the two sides stay in touch such meetings are to take place at least once every six months in accordance with an agenda approved by them in advance of every meeting. The outfit the Obama administration teamed up within the MOU UNEP was founded in 1972 by wealthy Canadian businessman Maurice Strong it is headquartered in Nairobi Kenya and has an office conveniently located in Washington D.C. Strong 19292015 was Under Secretary General of the U.N. when he founded UNEP and was an early advocate for combatting what he said was human induced climate change then known as global warming. In keeping with Strongs vision UNEP has worked closely with the Bonn based United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC. For its part UNFCCC has enthusiastically spread climate alarmism and gone to extraordinary lengths to deny the residents of the worlds poorest access to reliable and affordable electricity and transportation fuel thereby perpetuating their poverty. Given UNEPs pedigree and the Obama administrations unbridled hostility to fossil fuels President Trump should scrap the UNEP EPA MOU. Trump and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt inherited the MOU from their predecessors and are under no obligation to adhere to its content. The White House has already withdrawn from the Paris climate accord and President Trump chose to skip the climate change session at the recent G7 meeting in Quebec. Continued fealty to the Obama era MOU runs counter to the presidents goal of American global energy dominance which is anchored to our abundance of oil natural gas and coal. The ties that bound the UN and the Obama administration should not be allowed to constrain the choices of everyday Americans. Even if the MOU is non binding so too are the commitments all parties agreed to under the Paris climate accord. But recognizing the threat the Paris accord posed to U.S. energy security the Trump White House wisely walked away from it. The UNEP EPA memorandum is little more than an implementation tool of the Paris agreement and should suffer the same fate. Both are part of what is at its core a decidedly anti American agenda.

CNN will host a seven hour marathon of interviews with 10 presidential candidates about climate change on Wednesday beginning at 5 pm Eastern as part of its climate crisis town hall. A live stream of the town hall will air on CNN.com. You can also stream it via CNN apps on iOS Android Apple TV Roku Amazon Fire Chromecast and Android TV. The forum will also be broadcast on SiriusXM Channels 116 454 795 and the Westwood One Radio Network. Here is the format The audience will be composed of selected Democrats independents and stakeholders. No public tickets will be issued. That a major television network would devote so much time to a single issue is a sign of how important climate change has become for Democrats and how successful activists have been in elevating the issue. Climate change has rocketed up the list of concerns for primary voters with some polls showing climate change as the number one issue and other indicating that strong majorities want robust climate action from the White House. Activists groups like the Sunrise Movement have refused to let the Democratic National Committee ignore the issue holding sit ins outside their headquarters to demand a climate debate. The DNC responded that it will not hold a climate change debate for 2020 presidential contenders nor will it allow candidates to attend a third party debate. But CNN and MSNBC have found a loophole in the rules that still permits candidates to attend televised forums and town halls. CNN did not respond to requests for comment. MSNBCs climate forum is scheduled for September 19 and 20. In the past few months candidates have been steadily releasing their own visions for how to limit warming this century. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee who made climate change the centerpiece of his presidential campaign and put out the most comprehensive policy agenda is now out of the race giving other candidates some room to distinguish themselves on the issue. Several candidates including Booker Buttigieg and Harris are issuing new climate plans this week. For the most part the Democratic presidential contenders agree that climate change demands a serious policy response and that the US needs to become carbon neutral by roughly the middle of the century. And indeed many have voiced support for the Green New Deal and most have pledged to refuse donations from the fossil fuel industry. The main differences among the candidates lie in how much political capital they intend to expend on fighting climate change and what they would do with executive authority. The town hall will give them an opportunity to present their plans in greater detail and with more nuance. In the prior two rounds of presidential debates spanning more than eight hours climate change received just 35 minutes of airtime. Much of the discussion was shallow and uninformative partly a consequence of having to split attention across 20 candidates. A forum format with one on one discussions with the candidates could better get at these distinctions forcing candidates to make the affirmative case for their own policies rather than sniping at those from other candidates. On the other hand a candidate in the hot seat wont receive any direct challenges from their opponents. It would behoove the networks to focus their discussion on getting at these subtle differences among the candidates like what executive orders they would sign how high climate change ranks as a priority and what measures would a candidate pursue to ensure a just transition to clean energy. Voxs David Roberts and I have come up with some questions that could serve as starting points. CNNs climate change forum has immense potential to illuminate real differences among the candidates and inform the public about the often weedy details of climate policy. However it remains to be seen if there is an audience with a seven hour attention span for a single issue. And theres always the risk that it could devolve into rote recitals of platitudes. Heres to hoping we learn something new.	False	True	False	True	True
Italian prime minister Paolo Gentiloni visited Assisi Wednesday to commemorate the feast of Italys patron St. Francis in conjunction with the towns announcement it was divesting itself of all oil coal and gas holdings in a gesture aimed against commonly cited causes of manmade global warming. The Franciscan monasterial complex in Assisi the spiritual home of the Franciscan friars throughout the world is among the 40 Catholic institutions and organizations jointly announcing their adherence to an international ecological campaign calling for the disinvestment from all fossil fuels in the hopes of combatting climate change. The Mayor of Assisi Stefania Proietti indicated the citys extensive olive groves as an effective tool for mitigating climate change because of the trees ability to absorb the large quantities of carbon dioxide it needs in order to grow and produce olives. In a world in which the ecological crisis is an external manifestation of the ethical cultural and spiritual crisis of modernity it is necessary to recall the values of custody of creation the preferential option for the poor and the peace that is built in everyday life including with attention to the care of the common home she said. The Assisi diocese joined the dioceses of Caserta and Gubbio in this symbolic gesture along with dozens of other Catholic organizations throughout the world such as the Archdiocese of Cape Town the Belgian bishops conference the German Bank for Church and Caritas. In this new wave of ethical investing the total figure of divestiture for the church groups involved has not been disclosed but is reportedly four times higher than a previous church record. Coordinating these efforts is the World Catholic Climate Change Movement which in January sponsored the first world conference on fossil fuel divestment from a Catholic perspective at Romes Pontifical Lateran University. The moral clarity of these 40 institutions is a source of deep joy said Toms Insua the director of the Movement. Their leadership is launching a path that the World Bank and its financial organs should follow. Considering that the World Bank is meeting these days in Washington we hope its leaders will notice that the fossil free movement has grown and is getting stronger. Christiana Figueres the former UN climate tsar who helped negotiate the Paris climate accord lauded the move as a further sign we are on the way to achieving our collective mission. I hope we will see more leaders like these 40 Catholic institutions commit because while this decision makes smart financial sense acting collectively to deliver a better future for everybody is also our moral imperative she said. Earlier this year Pope Francis momentarily departed from his denunciation of fossil fuels offering a large donation of tons of cost effective fuel briquettes to heat the homes of internally displaced persons IDPs in Ukraine. As part of the Pope for Ukraine initiative Francisdonatedmore than 2.5 tons of fuel per displaced family cared for by the parish of the Holy Theotokos in the village of Vilcha. The combustible fuel briquettes reportedly were sufficient to heat the homes and apartments of more than a hundred resettled families throughout the heating season and into the coming winter as well. The politically incorrect gift highlighted thecost effectivenessand ready availability of fossil fuels which were responsible for powering the industrial revolution throughout the developed world. Pope Francis has been a vocal advocate of clean renewable energy and the reduction of carbon emissions. His groundbreaking 2015 encyclicalletterLaudato Sion care for the environment was the first teaching letter of its sort in the history of the Catholic Church. In that text Francis wrote of an urgent need to take steps leading to the substitution of fossil fuels with alternative energy sources.	False	False	False	False	False
Climate change garners most of the headlines but the Trump administration is pushing a much larger and broader pro pollution agenda whose latest manifestation is a push at the EPA to overturn a long established scientific consensus that fine particulate pollution colloquially soot kills people. This is critically important for two main reasons. One is that for decades the EPA has been regulating various sources of particulate emissions and the science around how harmful they are plays a role in driving how strict those regulations become. The other is that particulate emissions play a key role in the bureaucratic politics of climate change. Because carbon dioxide emissions are global and the consequences of climate change are also global it is generally hard to demonstrate that cutting a given source of greenhouse gas emissions will have large benefits to Americans. But most regulations that reduce carbon emissions also reduce much more localized soot and taking into account the fact that soot has a marked tendency to kill people who live nearby the emissions sources is important to making the cost benefit analysis math work. Tony Cox an industry consultant Trump tapped to lead the EPAs Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee argues that the EPAs agencys current standards for evaluating this question does not feature enough causal rigor. He wants to abandon the current weight of the evidence standards that allows for a wide range of evidence to be considered with credibility weighted according to the quality of study design in favor of a very narrow class of studies that employ manipulative causation methods. But as Francesca Dominici a biostatistician at Harvards T.H. Chan School of Public Health writes with researcher Gretchen Goldman in a new Science essay on the subject this loads the dice against demonstrating harms because randomized control trials are not possible or ethical when studying environmental hazards. In other words you cant get a group of volunteers together and then randomly assign half of them to have the air they breathe be deliberately poisoned just to see how bad the poison is. You have to rely on ways of exploiting random variation through methods like observational data time series and quasi experiments. Its true of course that you dont want to do a completely naive associational study and then leap to big policy conclusions from it. But public health researchers are aware of the limits of the data available and use matching statistical controls and other standard techniques to try to get a clearer picture of whats going on. Barring all that evidence would as Dominic writes place a nearly unattainable burden of proof on the scientific community and totally undermine the EPAs legal mandate to protect vulnerable people. Both the public health research and the EPA debate are largely focused on the question of soots ability to kill people through e.g. asthma but theres a big emerging set of empirical economics studies suggesting that fine particulates have a wider range of adverse cognitive impacts and are significantly underrated. In other words the consequences of rolling back the war on soot could be substantially worse than the mortality impacts alone imply. Economists like public health researchers are limited by their inability to deliberately poison people in order to study the impact of the poisoning. Consequently none of the studies Ive read on particulate pollution and cognitive impairment quite reaches gold standard levels of scientific evidence. But there are instead lots of quasi experiments and statistical matching studies and they all find that air pollution is worse than we thought. In addition to killing small numbers of people air pollution harms large numbers of people in small but meaningful ways This is an emerging field of study and it would obviously benefit from some further inquiry. That said it appears to be the case that fine particulate pollution induces cognitive impairments in school children white collar workers blue collar workers and the elderly in other words all people at all stages of life. Each of these impacts independently suggests that we are currently allowing too much air pollution and they also cry out for more research that attempts to assess the long term cumulative impact of pollutants that appear to induce cognitive problems throughout the life cycle. The question of exactly how much we are under regulating particulates seems somewhat open to me but the sign of the error is very clear.	True	False	False	False	True
In his first year as head of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt has made a huge mark shrinking his agency and repealing as many Obama era environmental regulations as possible. And as I pointed out last month in this feature story hes also overseen a drastic slowdown in the day to day work of the agency. Key offices remain vacant and the implementation of new environmental rules has stalled effectively throttling the agency. But one of EPAs most important jobs is to enforce civil penalties for companies that breach limits for hazardous chemicals like sulfur dioxide and hydrochloric acid. And one new measure of Pruitts foot dragging thats just emerged is how much money EPA has been collecting from polluters lately. According to a new report from the Environmental Integrity Project a watchdog group that advocates for enforcement of environmental laws the amount of fines collected by Trumps EPA has plummeted compared to the agency under the past three presidents in their first year in office. Check out this chart The fines come from consent decrees a type of legal settlement where a party has to take a specific action but does not have to admit fault or liability. The consent decrees here involve violations of federal environmental laws like the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. This tally doesnt include penalties from EPAs Superfund program criminal cases or the administrative actions that EPA takes to resolve smaller violations. The number of civil cases filed by the EPA to collect these fines in the first place has also declined. In President Clintons first year there were 73 under Bush 112 under Obama 71. In 2017 there were just 48 cases. What this means is that the EPA is not going after polluters like it used to. Less enforcement doesnt mean there arent a whole lot of violations that are out there said Eric Schaeffer executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project who led the civil enforcement office at the EPA under Presidents Clinton and Bush in a call with reporters. He noted that many of these civil cases take months to complete so some of the cases completed under Trump started under Obama. In a consent decree reached with Exxon Mobil last October the EPA boasted that the company would spend 300 million to install pollution controls but Schaeffer noted that this total includes measures installed as far back as 2013. And its likely enforcement will decline further for ongoing environmental investigations. Many of those cases will drop out of sight if Congress agrees to cut the agencys enforcement budget by 17 percent as President Trump has proposed according to the report. Enforcement matters especially to the people who live and work next to plants that continue to release more pollution than the law allows. The EPA did not respond to a request for comment.

President Donald Trump's eldest son Don Jr. has criticized Time magazine for naming Greta Person of the Year 2019 in a mocking tweet. The businessman denounced the choice as a 'marketing gimmick' and said the prize should have honored 'Hong Kong Protesters fighting for their lives and freedoms' his father was also a finalist. Tweeting yesterday in response to Time magazine he wrote 'Time leaves out the Hong Kong Protesters fighting for their lives and freedoms to push a teen being used as a marketing gimmick.' The 16 year old Swedish face of climate activism made headlines after shouting 'How dare you?' at world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly earlier this year accusing them of failing the younger generation. An image of her stare at Donald Trump as he entered the UN quickly became a social media meme. Miss Thunberg was up against four other Time's finalists including anti government Hong Kong protesters U.S. house speaker Nancy Pelosi the anonymous whistleblower who revealed Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July that may lead to his impeachment and in ironically also Donald Trump. The young activist attracted international attention after holding a sign that said 'skolstrejk fr klimatet' or 'School strike for the climate' in Swedish parliament last year. The activist has drawn increasingly large crowds with her appearances at protests and conferences over the past year and a half. Veteran campaigners and scientists have welcomed her activism including her combative speeches challenging world leaders to do more to stop global warming. Time editor in chief Edward Felsenthal told the Today show 'She became the biggest voice on the biggest issue facing the planet this year coming from essentially nowhere to lead a worldwide movement.' He confirmed she is the magazine's youngest ever choice. Malala Yousafzai was runner up in 2012 losing out to Barack Obama aged 15. U.S. president last month signed legislation backing the Hong Kong protesters in their fight for democracy which could be the reason for his son's backing. The protests begun in March when an extradition bill now suspended called for those facing trials to be sent to mainland China which was seen as a threat to the region's autonomy. Thunberg has not responded to the criticism but retweeted Time magazine's cover featuring herself. Today President Donald Trump lashed out at 16 year old global warming activist Greta Thunberg on Thursday and told her to 'chill' as he called her Time magazine 'Person of the Year' award 'ridiculous.' 'Greta must work on her Anger Management problem then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta Chill!' Trump tweeted The president was responding to Christian filmmaker Roma Downey who tweeted the Time cover with the word 'Congrats.' Minutes after his tweet Thunberg changed her Twitter profile biography to read 'A teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend.' Thunberg was in Madrid on Wednesday where she addressed negotiators at the U.N.'s COP25 climate talks. There she accused political and business leaders of polishing their images rather than taking aggressive action in the fight against climate change at the UN climate talks. In a speech the teenager also criticized governments for avoiding taking action to cut greenhouse gas emissions and 'not behaving as if we are in an emergency'. Greta said 'The biggest danger is not inaction the real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening when in fact almost nothing is being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR.' She said the science showed that at the current rate of emissions the world is set to use up the whole 'carbon budget' the amount of pollution that can be put into the atmosphere and still keep global warming to 1.5C in eight years.

The Trump administration has halted a study looking at the health risks of mountaintop removal coal mining. In a letter written on Friday the Interior Department announced the shutdown of the study which was started in 2016 under former President Barack Obama while the department undergoes an agency wide budgetary review. Scientists estimate at least 500 Appalachian mountaintops have undergone mountaintop removal mining a form of surface mining that harvests coal deposits too thin to work from a coal mine. The study had been launched at the request of two West Virginia agencies the state's Department of Environmental Protection and Bureau for Public Health. Ordered by the Obama administration the 1million two year study looked to investigate mountaintop removal in West Virginia Kentucky Virginia and Tennessee. An emphasis was placed on studying the 'effects from surface coal mining operations on air surface water groundwater and drinking water quality and on ecologic communities and soil that could potentially lead to human health concerns.' This came after a 2010 study in Science magazine reported an increase in mortality rates as well as an increase in incidences of lung cancer and kidney disease near where mountaintop mining is common. Birth defects were also reported in a 2011 study published in Science Daily. Some suggest the move may be part of President Donald Trump's efforts to bring back coal. In February he scrapped the Stream Protection Rule a regulation to protect waterways from coal mining waste and promised to bring back coal mining jobs. Additionally his proposed 2018 budget would cut funding for the Office of Surface Mining which is responsible for protecting society and the environment from the adverse effects of surface coal mining operations. Critics have railed against the Interior Department for moves seen as halting scientific growth. Several science advisory boards were frozen earlier this year by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. And Interior Department climate scientist Joel Clement allegedthat he and dozens of other scientists had been arbitrarily reassigned. 'It's infuriating that Trump would halt this study on the health effects of mountaintop removal coal mining research that people in Appalachia have been demanding for years' Bill Price Senior Appalachia Organizing Representative for Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign said in a statement. 'Stopping this study is a ploy to stop science in its tracks and keep the public in the dark about health risks as a favor to the mining industry pure and simple' said Democratic Representative Ral Grijalva of Arizona ranking member of the House Committee on Natural Resources in a statement.

Consumer goods giant Procter Gamble faces pressure from environmentalists to clean up its act. More than 150 groups are pushing the maker of Charmin toiler paper and Bounty paper towels to use recycled materials in its products. Currently neither of those products uses recycled paper and about one third of it is sourced from Canada's boreal forest a large swath of virgin forest that rings the Arctic Circle and acts as a critical check on climate change. It's just unacceptable that a company like PG is making toilet paper a product that is used for seconds and flushed from virgin pulp said Shelley Vinyard boreal corporate campaign manager for the Natural Resources Defense Council and one of several dozen protesters at PG's annual shareholders meeting in Cincinnati Ohio on Tuesday. The NRDC likens Canada's vast forests to the Amazon of North. Replacing just half of PG's virgin pulp usage with recycled content would dwarf the company's current climate commitments the NRDC said in a letter to the company that was co signed by 150 other activist groups. PG offers a simple reason for not using recycled wood pulp It doesn't make for good toilet paper. Have you tried recycled toilet paper yourself? a PG spokeswoman asked CBS MoneyWatch who also pointed to Charmin as a superior product. I promise you'll enjoy it much more she said. PG is one of the world's largest consumer products companies with annual revenue of 67 billion and a stock market value of 305 billion. Along with Charmin and Bounty its many brands include Crest toothpaste Gillette razors Head Shoulders shampoo Pampers diapers and Tide laundry detergent. Toilet paper made from recycled fibers doesn't have the same qualities causing people to use more tissue made directly from trees the spokeswoman added. She also noted that PG's experience making recycled tissue products shows that a significant amount of recycled fibers ends up as solid waste sludge going to landfill. Instead PG promises to source its paper from forests that are well managed which in the company's view is a more responsible course of action than using recycled products. About 40 of its product line today comes from forests certified by the Forest Stewardship Council a nonprofit conservation group according to the company and the FSC. Personally I buy recycled toilet paper because we can and it's good for the Earth said Andrew Musgrave director of Catholic Social Action at the Archdiocese of Cincinnati and one of the 150 signatories to the letter sent to PG. Musgrave said he learned about the issue of deforestation for toilet paper relatively recently through a member of the congregation and that it was a natural fit with church teachings on preserving the environment. We believe in the dignity of life and part of that is having a place to live he said. He added that Cincinnati based PG had a history of supporting work and social justice in the community and he believed it was possible to shift to a recycled paper product without reducing quality. Frankly there are a lot of different companies that have moved in the direction of using recycled paper and I have a hard time imagining that they would have done it if it were not economically sustainable Musgrave said. Making paper sustainably doesn't necessarily mean using 100 recycled content said Stephen Donofrio director of the Ecosystem Marketplace initiative at the nonprofit Forest Trends. It could potentially be a mix. It could be single source certified and recycled. Wood has a heavy presence in most U.S. bathrooms Americans use more tissue paper than any other nation except China which has more than four times its population. That comes out to 36 billion rolls per year according to an analysis in Scientific American. The top three companies in what's called the tissue industry PG Kimberly Clark and Georgia Pacific rely almost exclusively on virgin pulp for their products. Last week PG promised to increase the portion of FSC certified fiber in its products to 75 from the current 40 within six years and to better protect caribou habitat in the Canadian forest where it gets much of its pulp. FSC certification limits forest clear cutting and ensures trees are re planted at the same rate they are harvested. However even harvesting from a sustainably managed forest has an environmental cost when compared with leaving trees uncut in the first place. The question we should be asking is whether or not those products are from virgin primary forests which are rich with biodiversity food systems and other ecosystems Donofrio said. It's that natural infrastructure that we're trying to avoid being lost. When companies make these pledges to be sustainably sourced or use recycled content that's the problem that they're solving.

WASHINGTON Reuters The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday rejected for now a bid by the President Donald Trumps administration to block a trial in a lawsuit filed by young activists who have accused the U.S. government of ignoring the perils of climate change. The loss for the administration means it now faces a high profile examination of U.S. climate change policy during the trial that was due to begin on Oct. 29 in Eugene Oregon but has since been postponed by the judge. Chief Justice John Roberts on Oct. 19 had temporarily put the case on hold while the court as a whole decided how to proceed. The Supreme Courts three page order noted that the administration may still have grounds to take its arguments to the San Francisco based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch indicated they would have granted the administrations request. There was no indication how Trumps new Supreme Court appointee conservative Brett Kavanaugh voted on the issue. In the lawsuit 21 activists ages 11 to 22 said federal officials violated their rights to due process under the U.S. Constitution by failing to adequately address carbon pollution such as emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. The lawsuit was filed in 2015 against former President Barack Obama and government agencies in a federal court in Eugene Oregon. Both the Obama and Trump administrations have failed in efforts to have the lawsuit thrown out. The administration has said a courtroom is not the appropriate venue for a debate on climate change policy. This suit is an attempt to redirect federal environmental and energy policies through the courts rather than through the political process by asserting a new and unsupported fundamental due process right to certain climate conditions Trump administration Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in court papers. Francisco noted that the plaintiffs are seeking to hold the U.S. government liable for the cumulative effects of carbon dioxide emissions from every source in the world over decades. Lawyers for the young activists led by Julia Olson of a Eugene based group called Our Childrens Trust that brought the lawsuit have said their clients have suffered irreparable harm from the effects of a changing climate. This is a case about the fundamental rights of children and whether the actions of their government have deprived them of their inalienable rights Olson said in court papers. On July 30 the high court rejected an earlier application by the Trump administration calling it premature. Eugene Oregon based federal Judge Ann Aiken has repeatedly allowed the case to move forward to trial over the objections of the government. The trial will proceed if neither the high court nor the 9th Circuit intervene. Aiken said in an Oct. 15 ruling that although the case raised questions about the role of the judiciary delving into a matter of policy those concerns were not enough to warrant a dismissal of the entire case.

Hes written poems lamenting legal abortion. He wants to make gay sex illegal and overturn marriage equality. The former judge says he places Gods law above the Constitution describes Islam as a false religion and has repeatedly defied federal orders to remove religious ornaments from his courtroom. He doesnt believe in evolution compares preschool to Nazi style indoctrinationand once said the Sept. 11 2001 terrorist attacks were divine punishment for the United States godlessness. His campaign site calls for energy independence and stakes out the vague position Coal mining and oil drilling should be encouraged subject only to reasonable regulations. In July he was the only candidate to refuse to answer questions about climate change for a Montgomery Advertiser story. Katie Frost his spokeswoman did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Not only do scientists disagree on global warming but there is little hard evidence that carbon emissions cause changes to the global climate. But it appears that Obama and his liberal administration are not really interested in what the Constitution or the scientific community have to say when it interferes with their radical agenda. In fact 97 percent of peer reviewed scientists have found that climate change is a serious threat and is at least exacerbated by humans. And there are serious flaws in the studies published by the 3 percent of scientists whose research suggests otherwise. A research review published last November found errors in the methodologies assumptions or analyses used by in those studies that when fixed put the findings in line with mainstream climate scientists. That consensus is so strong that in 2005 one of the standard bearers of the evangelical Christian politics in which Moore enshrouds himself planned to take a stance affirming the science. That year the National Association of Evangelicals proposed adopting a new platform called For the Health of a Nation. The position paper called for protecting Gods creation and embracing the governments help in doing so. But after receiving unanimous support by the board the 30 million member organization voted down the proposal kickstarting a campaign by fossil fuel interests to transform the doubt over global warming into what Splinter in a lengthy report published in August succinctly described as the word of God. White evangelical Christians more than 80 percent of whom supported Trump in last Novembers election are the least likely of any U.S. religious group to believe climate change is occurring according to 2015 data from the Pew Research Center. Just 28 percent of white evangelicals believe the planet is warming primarily due to human activity compared with 56 percent of black Protestants and 41 percent of white mainline Protestants who say the opposite. Roughly 37 percent of white evangelicals dont believe the climate is changing at all. This is a demographic Moore who attends the Gallant First Baptist Church near his home seems likely to tap. Alabama has the highest percentage of Baptists after Tennessee with 31 percent of residents in the state according to Pews 2014 Religious Landscape study. In December The Baptist Press the official media arm of the Southern Baptist Convention published an open letter of support for Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitts nomination amid fierce backlash over the former Oklahoma attorney generals rejection of the scientific consensus on climate change. On one side of that debate is a theological argument thats gained prominence in some corners of evangelical Christianity over the past decade. According to that interpretation God provided fossil fuels for humans to exploit and Christian environmentalists who believed in shifting to renewable energy were deceived by the false doctrine of the so called Green Dragon a demonic force that fooled people into putting the needs of the planet ahead of those of the poor. As a Christian I have a responsibility to try my best to be as wealthy as possible James Wanliss an associate professor of physics at Presbyterian College in South Carolina and the author ofThe Green Dragon Is Global Warming a Religion? told HuffPost. If youre grindingly poor youre just going to care about your next meal and too bad if trees get in your way. I see that some of the anthropogenic global warming rhetoric has been picked up by people who are really excited about trying to experiment with those types of systems in the West as a solution to those problemsWanliss said. As a Christian thats a problem to me because well aside from the philosophy behind those systems its just again empirically been disastrous. Roy Moore hes part of that culture Michael Hansen executive director of the Birmingham based environmental group Gasp and a former candidate in the Democratic primary for Senate told HuffPost. Something that I hear quite a bit from the right wing in Alabama is that God gave us fossil fuels for a reason. I wouldnt be surprised if Roy Moore said that at some point during his campaign. Alabama emerged in June from more than a year of the worst drought in memory affecting 98 percent of the state. The state braced twice in the past month for damage from the devastating series of hurricanes that struck neighboring states but it was spared the destruction after the winds weakened. Yet nearly 37 percent of Alabamians dont believe global warming is happening 7 percentage points below the national average according to survey data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.

At a town hall event in Ames Iowa Wednesday Democrat candidate for president Beto ORourke compared the Green New Deal to defeating the Nazis and surviving the Great Depression. Why is it that Democrats clearly lacking in any context of what World War II and living in the greatest generation were like enjoy comparing these things to mundane policy initiatives? Addressing the Green New Deal ORourke summoned his followers to harness the the most ingenious mechanism yet devised by humankind to free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels. The mechanism Robert Francis is referring to is a democracy. Meanwhile what comes out of Betos mouth next is not in fact ingenious. Its exactly what we did to face the Nazi threat the existential threat to Western democracies in 1941 he said. Exactly what we did to lift millions out of the Great Depression and build the largest middle class the world had yet seen. And is exactly what we need to do now to free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels greenhouse gas emissions invest in the jobs and technologies of renewable energy that will allow us to meet our obligation and allow this country once again to claim its status as the indispensable nation. Its hard not to look at this hyperactive Gen X er and think this is exactly what the far left has become a group that has rarely experienced hardship in their lifetime because of the greatest generation comparing everything they find upsetting to the greatest generation. Beto likes his World War II comparisons so much that he mentions it time and again when discussing the threat of global warming. Sure every time he mentions it ORourke is mocked relentlessly by those outside of his little campaign crowds. But he doesnt care because in his mind its real. How else to explain last months comments that environmental activists are just like those who were on the beaches in Normandy. When you think about leadership those who preceded us those who were on the beaches in Normandy those who faced an existential threat to Western democracy and our way of life they showed us the way he said referencing a plan to fight climate change. This is the final chance he added echoing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez warning that the world will end due to climate change. The scientists are unanimous on this. We have no more than 12 years to take incredibly bold action on this crisis. Every time I watch this guy speak I think of the UPS Guy from Mad TV. How does a man who under normal circumstances would be working as a barista in the local coffee shop dole out knowledge of experience on World War II to a Democrat party who eagerly laps it up? How did the resistance get to this point? Its embarrassing.	False	True	False	False	False
Sen. Kamala Harris was the first candidate to mention the Green New Deal in the first presidential debate when she corrected NBC moderator Chuck Todd. I dont even call it climate change she said. Its a climate crisisThat is why I support a Green New Deal. And yet of the top four presidential candidates Harris has the thinnest legislative record when it comes to climate change her 2019 bill to electrify school bus fleetshas taken only a slice at the problem. On Mondaythe day beforethe second round of debates among the 20 Democratic presidential hopefuls she released the first major climate proposal of her campaign partnering with the original author of the Green New Deal resolution Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. The proposal called the Climate Equity Act is not a comprehensive plan for addressing the climate crisis or cutting pollution but it focuses on addressing equity and environmental racism echoing the broader themes of Harris campaign. It does begin to answer one of the key questions around the Green New Deal debate which is how to include low income and communities of colorthe frontline voices facing the most dire effects of climate changein the legislative process. From the toxic air embattling Cancer Alley in Louisiana and Asthma Alley in the Bronx to the unsafe drinking water in Californias San Joaquin Valley and Flint Michigan Harris said the nations bedrock environmental protections have not stopped frontline communities from continually falling through the cracks. The proposal requires that any environmental legislation receive an equity score to assess its impact on frontline communities much in the same way the Congressional Budget Office scores the economic costs and impacts of bills. The proposal also requires an extra level of scrutiny for White House executive actions on low income communities and people of color and feedback from those affected communities. A new Climate and Environmental Justice officewouldcoordinate all the impact assessment efforts. We cannot accept a status quo where children of color are drinking toxic water in Flint or breathing toxic air in Louisianas Cancer AlleyHarris said in a statement. This systemic environmental injustice will only get worse and become more ingrained if climate and environmental policies like the Green New Deal do not specifically focus on lifting up these communities. Mustafa Ali the former head of the EPA environmental justice office noted that the idea of scoring environmental justice impacts is something advocates have pushed for years. When you look at where most of the fossil fuel facilities are located they are in communities of color Ali said. That same pollution is warming up our planet and warming our oceans. People are starting to pay at lot of attention to climate change and have to address the environmental injustices. Harris is not the only presidential candidate who has come out with a plan focused on environmental justice.Jay Inslee released the fifth plank of his climate change package on Monday that refocuses the White House Council of Environmental Quality as a new clearinghouse for environmental justice and has its own scoring mechanism for impacts. Ali points out an equity score is potentially significant because it helps put up a wall of protections around those communitiesaddingI think its just now starting to gather steam.

According to data fromBrazils National Institute for Space Research NISR which monitors deforestation and wildfires around 74000 fires have occurred across the Amazon rainforest in 2019 an 84 percent increase from the same period in 2018. Macron took to Twitter on Thursday to express concern about the fires that have reached a record number this year devastating vast swathes of forest long described as the lungs of the earth. Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rain forest the lungs which produces 20 of our planets oxygen is on fire Macron wrote on Twitter. It is an international crisis. Members of the G7 Summit lets discuss this emergency first order in two days Meanwhile a spokesperson for the Elyse Palace said that in light of Brazils attitude these recent weeks Macron can only conclude that President Bolsonaro lied to him during the Osaka Summit in June where world leaders agreed on the urgent need to combat climate change pollution and environmental destruction. The decisions and statements from Brazil these recent weeks show clearly that President Bolsonaro has decided to not respect his commitments on the climate nor to involve himself on the issue of biodiversity the spokesperson said. As a consequence Macron now plans to veto any trade deal in its current state between the European Union and the Mercosur bloc of South American nations including Brazil Argentina Paraguay and Uruguay. Posting on Facebook Bolsonaro accused Macron of making personal political gains in an internal matter for Brazil and other Amazonian countries adding that the sensationalist tone he used does nothing to solve the problem. These countries that send money here they dont send it out of charity he said.They send it with the aim of interfering with our sovereignty. Yet amid rising international pressure the 63 year old former army captain reportedly signed an executive order deploying the military to help reduce the wildfires which he previously blamed on NGOs who were seeking to undermine his administration. On the question of burning in the Amazon which in my opinion may have been initiated by NGOs because they lost money what is the intention? Bolsonaro told reporters in Brasilia. Maybe I am not affirming it these NGOs are carrying out some criminal actions to draw attention against me against the government of Brazil. This is the war we are facing.	True	True	False	True	False
Brazil called up its military to combat fires that are raging in the Amazon after international protests over the governments seeming unwillingness to act in the face of an environmental disaster. Around 44000 troops and military aircraft will be made available for what has been described as an unprecedented effort to fight fires in at least six Brazilian states. It remains unclear how many of those troops will be put on the line to combat the forest fires. Although fires are common this time of year they are more widespread. So far nearly 77000 wildfires have been reported across the country this year which marked an 85 percent increase from the same period last year. And while the fires have been burning for weeks the international outcry grew this week as photographs spread on social media. Protests took place in Brazil and across the world Friday and Saturday demanding that the Brazilian government take action. Much of the attention has focused on Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro a long time critic of the countrys environmental regulations who had tried to minimize the effects of the fires. Yet his tune appeared to change after leaders in Europe said a major trade deal could be at risk and many on social media started calling for a boycott of Brazilian products. Bolsonaro approved the involvement of the military to help put out fires in a televised speech Friday in which he claimed his government would have zero tolerance for environmental crimes. Protecting the rain forest is our duty he said. That was quite a change in tune for a president who had previously described environmental protections as an impediment for economic growth and had blamed non governmental organizations of starting the fires. Yet despite the new found sense of urgency some are skeptical that the involvement of the military would really be able to do much. Once you have a huge forest fire like that especially when you dont have all the kind of forest fire fighting equipment that you have in places like the U.S. or Portugal its difficult to extinguish Alfredo Sirkis executive director of Brazil Climate Center a think tank said. Theyll only be extinguished by themselves depending on the weather conditions. It was clear though that deploying the military was also in part a public relations ploy. A military leader for example said that part of its mission involved creating a positive perception of the country. As attention focused on the fires burning in the Amazon it became clear that Europeans have taken the role as the global leaders in the fight against climate change notes the New York Times. As European leaders led by French President Emanuel Macron criticized Brazil for its inaction President Donald Trump waited until Friday evening to say that the United States was willing to help only to add that future trade prospects with Brazil are very exciting.

Alexandria Ocasio Cortez has found something else to blame on the supposed climate crisis. A few weeks ago she let us all know that heavy rain in a city built on a swamp was absolute proof of catastrophic global warming. She posted a picture of a few inches of water and called it unprecedented flooding even though Washington D.C. has had actual major floods several times throughout its relatively short history. Then there was the explosion at an oil refinery which despite not being a weather event at all nor being caused by one was somehow the fault of climate change. Weird how everything just so happens to reinforce her political narrative and now shes back with another hot take. You see it rained in New York City and that was obviously caused by global warming. Did it rain a lot? No not really. There was no record rainfall or a weeks worth of severe storms. It justrained something it has presumably been doing there for millions of years. In reality New York Citys subway system is a dumpster fire of mismanagement. The citys communist Mayor Bill de Blasio has run it into the ground with stupid financial decisions and misuse of funds. You see theyve got money to pay for illegal aliens healthcare but they cant keep the trains running or the sewage systems from backing up. The flooding in this case wasnt because of a massive downpour. It was because the infrastructure is falling apart. If a pipe bursts in your house thats not the fault of climate change. On a broader note Im confused. What happened to climate change leading to massive desertification and droughts? Now the alarmists want to complain about rain and flooding as if those are new phenomenons on the earth? Wouldnt those be good things in the face of supposed extreme heat? But making sense isnt a tenant of the climate religion. Ive got a new twitter! Please help by following 	True	False	False	True	False
The EPAs announcement makes no mention of the risks coal ash poses to human health and the environment. Rather the agency justified its move by noting it is expected to save the utility sector between 31 and 100 million annually. Todays coal ash proposal embodies EPAs commitment to our state partners by providing them with the ability to incorporate flexibilities into their coal ash permit programs based on the needs of their states Pruitt said in a statement. Coal fired power plants in the United States produce roughly 140 million tons of coal ash per year containing toxic heavy metals such as arsenic lead selenium and other carcinogenic substances. The waste product is typically stored in wet ponds nearly 46 percent of which operated without liners to prevent hazardous chemicals from seeping into groundwater according to 2012 data released by the EPA. Living within a mile of a wet coal ash storage pond poses a greater health threat than smoking a pack of cigarettes a day raising the risk of cancer to one in 50 an EPA study from 2010 found. Children are particularly at risk of learning disabilities birth defects asthma and cancer with 1.54 million living near such storage sites according to EPA data cited by the Sierra Club. This is the second biggest toxic pollution threat in our country and we need to clean it up not make things easier for polluters Earthjustice attorney Lisa Evans said in a statement. People living near more than a thousand toxic coal ash sites are at risk. They face contaminated drinking water toxic dust in the air and serious health threats just because the EPA is choosing to side with polluters over the public. In 2014 the EPA catalogued 158 cases where coal ash compromised water quality including 22 that involved recycled waste product. And a government study in 2012 estimated that the damage to fish and wildlife at 21 disposal sites came at a cost of more than 2.3 billion enough money to construct 155 landfills with state of the art composite liners and leachate collection systems. The rule change marks the Trump administrations latest rollback of clean water regulations at a time when drinking water contamination crises are proliferating across the country. In February 2017 less than a month after taking office President Donald Trump signed a bill to allow coal companies to dump waste into streams. In June the EPA moved to repeal the 2015 Waters of the U.S. rule that extended 1972 Clean Water Act protections to roughly 20 million acres of wetlands and streams. The agency formally suspended the rule on Jan. 31. Scrapping the only federal rules on coal ash presents a major problem in the face of storms floods and other extreme weather made more frequent and intense by climate change. When Hurricane Maria made landfall over Puerto Rico last year flood waters swelled the river in the city of Guayama wreaking havoc on the citys 42000 residents and distributing its five story tall tower of coal ash. Coal ash in particular has long been a hot button issue in the utility industry. In 2014 Duke Energy one of the countrys biggest power companies spilled nearly 39000 tons of coal ash into the Dan River causing one of North Carolinas biggest environmental disasters in its history. In 2016 then Gov. Pat McCrory R signed a bill that dramatically watered down legislation forcing Duke to clean up its coal ash pits without requiring the company to excavate the waste or provide clean water to residents near the pond. Yet two years later the company is still battling environmentalists and regulators in the state as the utility seeks to pass the cleanup costs onto ratepayers in the form of a price hike. In a separate legal fight over coal ash the Tennessee Valley Authority the nations biggest public utility last month appealed a federal judges order to clean up decades of coal ash environmentalists say poisoned water in the Volunteer State. Eighteen states and an alliance of big corporate interests urged an appeals court to overturn the decision last month. Gutting the EPAs rules on coal ash pollution takes some pressure off the utilities but thrusts the industry back into the sort of regulatory uncertainty Pruitt vowed to alleviate. In 2014 before the EPA passed its coal ash rule the American Coal Ash Association a trade group complained about regulatory uncertainty that has impeded the beneficial use of coal ash for half a decade. Its unclear whether Pruitts new rule promotes recycling coal ash for other uses. Coal ash can be used to pave roads though the environmentalists say even that poses pollution risks. And last year Purdue University researchers announced new technology to sift rare earth elements highly valued components used in electronics and renewable energy hardware out of coal ash waste. Thomas Adams executive director of the American Coal Ash Association said he hopes the next part of the EPAs announcement will include changing a rule that mandates companies to go through a risk evaluation when stockpiling more than 12400 tons of coal ash for anything other than road projects. The EPA set the threshold in 2015 based on what Adams called an arithmetic error that he argued hurts the market for using coal ash in cement manufacturing or to fill structures such as building foundations. He said he hopes the EPA will raise the limit to 75000 tons. Thursdays announcement is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to end a perceived war on coal waged by the Obama administration. Last year the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group petitioned the EPA to roll back the Obama era coal ash rule calling it burdensome inflexible and often impracticable. The organization of some 80 utilities warned that regulating coal ash disposal would result in significant economic and operational impacts to coal fired power generation and could even force power plants to shut down.

Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortezs claim the world is gonna end in 12 years shouldnt come as a shock to anyone because shes only repeating the same doomsday narrative pushed by some scientists and news outlets for months. In fact Ocasio Cortez followed up her remarks from Monday night with acoupletweetsdoubling down on her 12 year warning but also showing she didnt make it up. The freshman Democrat pointed to a Voxarticlewarning we have just 12 years to limit devastating global warming and a Guardianarticleclaiming we have 12 years to limit climate change catastrophe both articles were based on a United Nations report from October 2018. That U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC report examined what would need to be done in order to limit future global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100. The report was mandated by the Paris climate accord. The IPCC reported greenhouse gas emissions would need to fall 45 percent below 2010 levels by 2030 and then reach zero by 2050 for a 66 percent chance of keeping projected warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius.RELATED Another Headline Grabbing Ocean Warming Study Is Full Of Factual Errors And Misleading Statements Scientist Says And in the months since that report news has been inundated with headlines warning its worse than we thought or the worlds ice sheets are reaching a tipping point. Themost widely reported climate studyin 2018warned we were on track for a hothouse Earth. Nearly ever natural disaster in 2018 were tied to global warming in some way from Californiasdevastating wildfirestohurricanesFlorence and Michael. All the news stories stressing climate alarm spurred calls for action on global warming. However many experts looking at the IPCCs report saw it asinfeasible to completely overhaul the global ecologyin 12 years and there are serious questions about the accuracy of U.N. climate models. Yet IPCC report authorsframedthis as a problem of political will not economics and technology. The report itself says there is no documented historic precedent for the sweeping changes needed to fight global warming. Thats the line activists and many politicians have taken up in the months since the IPCCs report. Indeed Ocasio Cortez saidglobal warming is her generations World War II. And what preceded World War II? The New Deal. Ocasio Cortez nowwants a Green New Dealto move the U.S. away from fossil fuels and address a variety of injustices she sees in our current economic system. And I think for younger people looking at this are more like how are we saying lets take it easy when 3000 Americans died last year how are we saying lets take it easy when the end person died from our cruel and unjust criminal justice system?

He refused to call the rapid warming of the planet a crisis. He repeatedly misrepresented his own agencys findings about a rule to gut an Obama era power plant regulation inflating the emissions cuts the new proposal would mandate. He even mixed up two of the most important climate science reports to come out in the last three months admitting he hadnt fully read the report co authored by researchers at his own agency. It was a brazen if not unexpected stance from the nominee to become the EPAs 15th administrator. Wheeler isnt new to the job Last month he became the longest serving acting chief in the agencys history having taken over in July when former Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in disgrace amid mounting scandals. In November 2017 when he appeared before the Senate environment and public works committee to interview for the EPAs No. 2 job Wheeler said he believed that man has an impact on the climate but whats not completely understood is what the impact is. In October the United Nations released a landmark determination that the world has until 2030 to halve global emissions or face catastrophic climate change. A month later the federal governments National Climate Assessment a congressionally mandated report issued by 13 agencies including the EPA confirmed the findings and warned of cataclysmic damage to the United States economy and human health and by 9F 5C or more by the end of this century. During Wednesdays hearing Wheeler initially mistook the United Nations report for the National Climate Assessment. Asked about the latter he said he did not review the report before it came out and that he held just one briefing meeting with his career staffers. He said the partial federal government shutdown now its fourth week forced him to delay future briefings. Wheeler dismissed thereportthis month that found U.S. emissions rose 3.4 percent last year blaming the jump on a manufacturing and industrial surge triggered by the Trump administrations deregulatory effort. But he claimed his proposals to dramatically weaken emissions rules for vehicles and power plants the largest and second largest sources of climate pollution respectively would provide reductions in line with the Obama era regulations they aim to replace. When pressed about the need to cut emissions Wheeler returned to a certain statistic over and over again stating that the Affordable Clean Energy rule he proposed in August would deliver carbon dioxide reductions 34 percent below 2005 levels compared to the 33 to 35 percent the Obama administrations Clean Power Plan would have provided. This is a fudged statistic however. The EPAsown analysisshows the so called ACE rule would actually increase CO2 emissions by 20 to 61 million tons nitrous oxide by 14000 to 43000 tons and sulfur dioxide by 29000 to 53000 tons. Those increases are expected to cause up to1400 premature deathsper year by 2030. Wheelers climate denial received some backup at Wednesdays hearing. Sen. James Inhofe R Okla. who once infamously brought a snowball to the Senate floor to debunk climate change submitted rebuttals to climate science reports from right wing think tanks such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Cato Institute both of which are funded by the fossil fuel billionaire Koch brothers. Wheeler blamed the shutdown for the delay in releasing a plan to deal with toxic perfluorinated substances in drinking water. Over the past few years the chemicals known as PFAS and linked to cancer and thyroid disease have been found in water sources across the country. Wheeler however declined to commit to a two year deadline for setting a drinking water standard for PFAS. Republican senators praised Wheelers proposal to replace another Obama era rule that sought to safeguard drinking water for millions of Americans by extending federal protections to 2 million miles of streams and 20 million acres of wetlands. Sen. Dan Sullivan R Alaska even prompted Wheeler with a question about his nearly two decades working for Bob Murray the influential and bombastic baron who runs the nations largest privately owned coal company. Wheeler used his response to note that the last four years of his time working for Murray were spent advocating for miners pensions. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse D R.I. brought out some visual aids to question Wheeler further about his relationship with Murray including a poster sized printout of a photo leaked from a March 2017 meeting between Murray and Energy Secretary Rick Perry where the coal executive provided a detailed wish list of policies to the administration. That meeting ended as another photo showed with a hug between Perry and Murray. Wheeler is seen sitting beside Murray in the picture.	True	False	False	True	False
Last week week a routine entry in the searchable database at the website of the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources indicated that the Dakota Access Pipeline saw an 84 gallon crude oil spill in April. The environmental Left rushed to publicize the incident as an I told you so moment but activists gloating reveals either their cynical dishonesty or their ignorance about how modern pipelines work. The spill occurred in an Energy Transfer Partners facility specifically equipped to catch spills. Moreover the precautions in place to prevent environmental damage worked exactly as they should according to the South Dakota Department of Environment and National Resources. As spills go this spill was contained all product was cleaned up quickly and there were no impacts to the environment Kim Smith a spokesperson for the South Dakota department told me. The containment system and notification system worked as they should. Compare that to the hysterical reaction from leftist activists and their media allies. Writing in the Guardian opinionist Julian Brave NoiseCat said that the leak demonstrates the risk of technological and human failure inherent in crude oil pipelines adding that indigenous communities ranchers and workers are forced to live under the constant threat of petroleum poisoning. Jan Hasselman a lawyer for the Standing Rock Sioux told the Huffington Post They keep telling everybody that it is state of the art that leaks wont happen that nothing can go wrong. Its always been false. They havent even turned the thing on and its shown to be false. And a Clean Technica reporter claimed the incident drives home an essential truth about all the systems mankind has devised to transport oil from place to placeaddingThey all leak. Somewhere somehow the vile stuff gets out and when it does it causes untold damage to the environment. Such biased narratives have bedeviled the Dakota Access Pipeline from the beginning. National media readily adopted opponents preferred rhetoric in articles calling demonstrators the water protectors and repeating their claims that the protests were peaceful and prayerful. In actuality the protests were anything but peaceful as we reported at the time. Local authorities struggled to respond as demonstrators resorted to violence and vandalism. Protestors reportedly threw Molotov cocktails and stones at law enforcement also threatening police and their families and posting their home addresses online. Local ranchers said protestors trespassed on their land and damaged their property. By the time the protests ended hundreds had been arrested. These facts received little coverage the media instead portraying a David and Goliath fight in which virtuous protesters took on a corrupt wealthy industry. And while the Left likes to accuse conservatives of being anti science it hasignored any evidence that doesnt support itsanti pipeline agenda. Comprehensive environmental reviews conducted under the Obama administration showed the risk posed by Keystone XL and the Dakota Access Pipeline to be minimal. But some of the same environmentalists who denounced Trump for moving ahead with the pipelines also rushed to participate in the March for Science. Green activists have also spent the last year publicizing scary statistics about oil pipelines. But just as with the recent Dakota Access Pipeline spill the reality is less convenient for their political preferences. Cutting edge technology such as the containment system installed at the pump station in Tulare S.D. means that its safer than ever to transport oil by pipeline. The Fraser Institute a Canadian free market think tank analyzed U.S. State Department data finding that 70 percent of spills that have occurred in North America were a cubic meter or less hardly the massive leakage environmentalists have implied. Moreover the Fraser Institute found that only 17 percent of spills take place along the pipelines route the rest occurring in facilities such as the Tulare pump station which are specially equipped to safely handle spills and avoid environmental contamination. Overall the number of pipeline incidents in which people or the environment were harmed has dropped by more than 50 percent since 1999 even as the United States saw its energy production skyrocket. The outcome of the Dakota Access Pipeline spill was a technological triumph that should reassure its skeptics. The pipelines opponents are trying to spin it into a cautionary tale. In doing so they reveal their own selective adherence to scientific reason. Jillian Kay Melchior is a fellow at the Independent Womens Forum.	False	False	False	True	True
North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper signed an executive order Monday he says is meant to combat climate change and lessen the impact of future natural disasters like hurricanes. Coopers order requires state agencies to encourage people to buy more electric vehicles use more wind and solar energy and cut energy use at state owned buildings. Cooper also asked agencies to promote climate adaptation and green energy use including wind and solar. A strong clean energy economy combats climate change while creating good jobs and a healthy environment said Cooper. With historic storms lashing our state we must combat climate change make our state more resilient and lessen the impact of future natural disasters. The order comes more than one month after Hurricane Florencedumped record amounts of rainfallover the Carolinas after making landfall as a Category 1 storm. Florence dumped 11 trillion gallons of rain over the Carolinas causing devastating floods and taking more than 50 lives. Democrats and environmentalists claimed the storm was made worse by man made global warming. Some scientists said warm waters supercharged Florence and sea level rise made storm surge significantly worse.RELATED Al Gore Wades Into A Bitter Battle Over The Fate Of Fracking In Colorado However not all scientists agreed. Cato Institute atmospheric scientist Ryan Maue pointed out thatFlorence formed over abnormally cool ocean waters then weakened over cooler waters the opposite of what forecasters expected. There is no reason to suggest that global warming or an ocean heat wave supercharged Hurricane Florence University of Washington climate scientist Cliff Masssaid in September.

He added theres no credible theory of observational evidence that such slowing down has anything to do with global warming. While scientists predict continued global warming could make future hurricanes more intensethe latest United Nations climate reportfound that many studies showed adecreasing trend in the global number of tropical cyclones andor the globally accumulated cyclonic energy. Cooper however says his executive order will make North Carolina more resilient and lessen the impact of future natural disasters by putting more electric vehicles on the road and cutting emissions. But even if Coopers plan achieves its goal of cutting state greenhouse gas emissions it would have virtually no impact on projected global warming based on climate model simulations. For example the Obama administrations pledge to cut U.S. emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 was only projected toavert 0.001 degrees Celsius of projected global warminga year. If thats the impact on future temperatures cutting emissions for the entire country would have North Carolinas emissions cuts would have an even less significant impact.	True	True	False	True	True
Climate change can't be halted if we carry on degrading the soil a report will say. There's three times more carbon in the soil than in the atmosphere but that carbon's being released by deforestation and poor farming. This is fuelling climate change and compromising our attempts to feed a growing world population the authors will say. Problems include soils being eroded compacted by machinery built over or harmed by over watering. Hurting the soil affects the climate in two ways it compromises the growth of plants taking in carbon from the atmosphere and it releases soil carbon previously stored by worms taking leaf matter underground. The warning will come from the awkwardly named IPBES the Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services a panel studying the benefits of nature to humans. The body which is meeting this week aims to get all the worlds governments singing from the same sheet about the need to protect natural systems. IPBES will formally release its report on Monday 6 May. About 3.2 billion people worldwide are suffering from degraded soils said IPBES chairman Prof Sir Bob Watson. That's almost half of the world population. Theres no question we are degrading soils all over the world. We are losing from the soil the organic carbon and this undermines agricultural productivity and contributes to climate change. We absolutely have to restore the degraded soil weve got. Governments have focused on climate change far more than they have focused on loss of biodiversity or land degradation. All three are equally important to human wellbeing. Soil expert Prof Jane Rickson from Cranfield University UK added The thin layer of soil covering the Earth's surface represents the difference between survival and extinction for most terrestrial life. Only 3 of the planet's surface is suitable for arable production and 75 billion tonnes of fertile soil is lost to land degradation every year. She said soils form at a rate of 1cm in 300 years. There's uncertainty about the exact level of global soil degradation. But the major hotspots are reported to be in South America where forests are being felled sub Saharan Africa India and China. Soil scientists in both the biggest Asian nations are worried that their ability to grow their own food may be compromised. In the US some soils are being restored as forests take over poor quality land previously worked by small farmers but others are still being degraded. The UK is not immune either. Some maize fields in south west England suffer major soil loss with heavy rainfall because growing maize leaves bare soil exposed. Heavy rain is more likely under climate change. Erosion is also a long standing issue in the fertile Fens where on dry windy days peaty soil particles sometimes form a kind of smog called the Fen Blow. Peat has a high carbon content and a recent paper suggests theres far more carbon being lost from peatlands than previously thought. And on the chalky hills of southern England chemical intensive crop farming is said to have caused the loss of over a foot of soil in some places. Soils are incredibly important for our well being said Dr Joanna Clark from Reading University. We all know that crops are grown in soil but soils are important for climate change as well. There's three times more carbon stored in soil than there is in the atmosphere. So imagine if all that carbon was released wed get runaway climate change. So we need to keep the carbon in the soil. The simplest way to protect soils while combating climate change is to let forests grow back. This option is favoured by fans of re wilding. But some farmers believe they can continue to produce food by changing the way they farm to enhance the soil. Brexit could give the UK greater flexibility on how to spend public money on farming enabling much more leeway to reward farmers for capturing carbon in the earth. But there are more than 700 soil types in the UK alone so it wont be simple.	True	False	False	True	True
The Duke of Sussex has defended his use of private jets saying he occasionally needs to ensure his family is safe. Speaking at the launch of an eco tourism project in Amsterdam Prince Harry added that he balances out the impact this has on the environment. The duke and his wife Meghan have faced criticism after newspapers claimed they flew privately four times in 11 days this summer. Prince Harry said he flew to the event on Tuesday commercially. At the launch of Travalyst aimed at encouraging the tourism industry to become more sustainable the duke was asked about his travel behaviour. I came here by commercial. I spend 99 of my life travelling the world by commercial he said. Occasionally there needs to be an opportunity based on a unique circumstance to ensure that my family are safe it's generally as simple as that. During his opening speech the duke said no one is perfect in terms of his impact on the environment. Questions have been asked about the royal couple's use of private jets and their impact following their support of environmental causes. Prince Harry has previously spoken about the importance of tackling climate change. In September's edition of Vogue edited by Meghan the prince spoke about environmental issues and his love for nature saying We are the one species on this planet that seems to think that this place belongs to us and only us. The Sussexes came under fire over the summer after taking a private flight to the home of singer Sir Elton John in Nice. Sir Elton defended the royal couple saying he provided them with his private plane to maintain a high level of much needed protection. He also said he paid to carbon offset their trip to his French home. Carbon offsetting allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flights. The money is then invested in environmental projects such as planting trees or installing solar panels which reduce carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. The duke said that what is important is what we do to balance out negative effects. He went on to say that he has always offset his carbon emissions and will continue to do so. In my mind it's the right thing to do and we need to make it cool he said. We have to connect people to where that little bit of extra money is actually going. Prince Harry has spent three years working on the project alongside five co founders Booking.com Ctrip Skyscanner TripAdvisor and Visa. He hopes it will improve conservation environmental protection and help increase the economic benefits of tourism for local communities. Figures from accounts published in June show the royal household's carbon emissions due to business travel almost doubled last year. The increase was put down to the use of chartered flights for more overseas visits which are planned by the Foreign Office. However emissions savings from greener heating and lighting meant the household's overall carbon footprint stayed around the same as the previous year.	True	False	False	True	False
Alexandria Ocasio Cortez isn't old enough to run for president. But the freshman congresswoman from New York introduced a Green New Deal resolution on Thursday that is already emerging as a key policy test for 2020 Democratic candidates. Our first step is to define the problem and define the scope of the solution Ocasio Cortez told reporters during a Thursday afternoon press conference for her newly introduced proposal which was quickly backed by Democratic presidential hopefuls Senators Kirsten Gillibrand Kamala Harris Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker. Small incremental policy solutions are not enough. Several contenders vying for the Democatic nomination have expressed support for the underlying principles of the sweeping resolution to combat climate change and activist groups energized by the November midterm election wins have been pressuring candidates to sign on as co sponsors. We are going to be pressuring all the 2020 contenders especially the senators to co sponsor the bill Stephen O'Hanlon a spokesperson for the Sunrise Movement a climate change group that staged a high profile sit in in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office in November which Ocasio Cortez attended told CBS News. It will make clear who is just using it as a buzzword and who is taking it seriously. Progressive activists are extremely supportive of the Green New Deal and think of it as the gold standard plan on climate and expect their presidential candidates to be treating it as such said Chad Bolt associate policy director of Indivisible a grassroots resistance group. Bolt says the environment ranks among the top three issues for its members. The resolution introduced by Ocasio Cortez and Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey a Democrat is broad and light on specifics and seen more as a roadmap for overhauling the economy than a concrete piece of legislation. The resolution includes plans to decarbonize the economy reduce greenhouse gases make sure low income and minority communities benefit create a federal jobs guarantee provide universal health care and make investments in infrastructure. The Green New Deal proposal is named after President Franklin Roosevelt's sweeping New Deal economic and labor reforms during the Great Depression. It's aimed a transforming the American economy by ending its dependence on fossil fuels investing heavily in renewable energy like solar and wind and sparking large scale job creation. Some proposals have set the goal to converting the entire U.S. economy to renewable energy within 12 years and eliminating the carbon footprint by 2030. The lack of specifics could present opportunities and liabilities for presidential candidates. On one hand it becomes a kind of catch all way to talk about the environment jobs and economic fairness issues at the forefront of the party's primary. But on the other it could put candidates in a difficult position when pressed on the costs and impact on certain jobs and industries. The debate over Medicare for All has already shown the kinds of risks and rewards candidates face. Republicans have branded the proposal as a costly fringe policy goal and many centrist Democrats have not backed the initiative. Pelosi referred to it Thursday morning as a suggestion and the green dream. It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive Pelosi told Politico in an interview. The green dream or whatever they call it nobody knows what it is but they're for it right? Later in the morning Pelosi said she had not seen the proposal. I do know its enthusiastic and I welcome all the enthusiasm that is out there she told reporters during her weekly press conference. Pelosi also named the nine Democratic members of the new Select Committee on the Climate Crisis and notably left Ocasio Cortez off the list. The New York Democrat said Pelosi offered her a spot but she declined it because she wanted to focus on the legislative side of climate policy. Despite some hesitation within the party the Democratic base sees the proposal as a way for its leaders to capitalize on their new power in Washington. In a statement to CBS News on Tuesday Congressman Ral Grijalva Democrat of Arizona confirmed that he will be supporting the resolution after initially being reluctant to back it. The Green New Deal will put the health and well being of our communities first Grijalva said. Its aspirational goals will help our country combat climate change through clean and renewable energy create millions of new jobs in the process and safeguard our environment for generations to come. Most of the Democratic presidential candidates have also broadly endorsed the idea behind the Green New Deal. Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley who's mulling a presidential bid said the issue should be an integral part of his party's agenda going forward. On CBSN's Red and Blue Merkley outlined what he believes should be the key components of a comprehensive Green New Deal. The core objectives are some things such as let's drive a fast transition from fossil fuel carbon transmission creating energy sources to renewable energy so that we save our planet. Second principle is let's create tens of millions of jobs as we renovate our energy economy he said Tuesday. A third principle a just transition for fossil fuel workers so that no one is left behind and so we show respect and gratitude for all the work they've done to power economy is the decades past.

Watch CNN's live town hall on the climate crisis featuring 10 Democratic presidential candidates tonight beginning at 5 p.m. ET. CNN Candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination and most scientists say the climate crisis is the existential threat of our time while President Donald Trump once claimed it's a hoax cooked up by the Chinese. Trump also said at last month's G7 meeting that I'm an environmentalist citing his experience filing environmental impact statements as a businessperson though he skipped an actual session about climate change that his fellow world leaders attended. That pretty much sums up the difference between how a Democrat would treat climate change compared with Trump as an emergency as opposed to as a joke. That in itself would be an enormous switch. This is a worldwide issue and solving it will take cooperation from countries like China and India. In addition the most important actions the US could take would require congressional approval no easy task when the Senate floor is controlled by a Republican who represents coal country. But presidents actually have quite a bit of power to change US climate policy on their own without waiting for Congress. A first set of steps would be to roll back numerous Trump actions that either sidelined US leadership on the climate or rescinded new standards that had been implemented during the Obama administration. CNN gathered input from advocacy groups former government officials and academics. Here are some things any president could do on Day One in office climate agreement was Promising to withdraw the US from the landmark 2015climate agreement was Trump's benchmark action rebutting the responsibility to act on climate change . He said without much evidence that it was a demeaning failure for American workers who would be expected to do more than those in other countries. The result is the US is one of just a few countries not taking part in the effort in which nations committed to varying amounts of carbon reduction. Every candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination has said they would bring the US back in. The US was supposed to reduce carbon emissions by 26 from 2005 levels by 2025 under the agreement. It probably won't get there with the willful sabotage of the Trump administration. But with certain states cities and companies trying to fill the void the US could get most of the way there according to groups like America's Pledge the coalition pushed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former California Gov. Jerry Brown. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont was the first presidential candidate to argue that Trump instead of declaring a national emergency at the border should do it on the climate instead. Others like Tom Steyer have followed suit. This would certainly focus national attention and could free up some funds without congressional approval. The President could easily declare a goal of 100 decarbonization by a given year say 2050 and direct his or her Cabinet secretaries to do everything in their power to meet it. At the request of automakers the Trump administration worked to roll back fuel economy standards for cars and trucks. A different President could push things again in the other direction. 5. Set a zero emission deadline for the US The Clean Power Plan was an Obama era regulatory scheme that required states to meet specific carbon emission reduction standards based on their individual energy consumption. The plan includes an incentive program for states to get a head start on meeting standards on early deployment of renewable energy and low income energy efficiency. 8. Reverse Trump's plan to speed up oil and gas pipelines Workers in the Bureau of Land Management worked through the partial government shutdown early this year to approve more and more applications for oil and natural gas drilling on public lands. A new administration could move in the opposite direction. 13. Use the SEC to scrutinize banks and investors for climate risks Most attention for climate change goes to the energy sector but banks and investors have an important role too. The Securities and Exchange Commission asks companies what risks climate change and new climate change regulations pose to their investments. 14. Tap into growing public sentiment and work with corporations States and cities are addressing climate change be it with zero emission vehicle goals or the regional cooperative of states in the Northeast that is trying to cap and reduce carbon emissions on its own. Corporate America is also moving on its own. It's setting up coalitions of companies and lobbying Congress for new action on climate change. As it stands right now the federal government is not even a part of that conversation. Pretty much everyone who agrees that climate change is a problem agrees that Congress will ultimately have to address it in a big way. That means placing some kind of price on carbon. The House voted to do this in 2010 but the so called cap and trade proposal didn't get a vote in the Senate and then Democrats lost control of the House for eight years.	True	False	False	True	True
President Donald Trump has called climate change a hoax and a very expensive tax on American businesses that make the US less competitive. He has threatened to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord in which countries around the world pledged to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to keep temperatures from rising past the critical 2C mark. And yet climate change is already imperiling Mar a Lago the crown jewel of Trumps extensive real estate portfolio and his preferred location for carrying out many of his official presidential duties. Rising sea levels are causing more frequent and more damaging tidal floods on the Florida coast and projections suggest that the risk to lives and property from climate change related flooding events is only going to increase dramatically in the coming years. The National and Oceanic Atmospheric Administration NOAA has put out a variety of different estimates of rising sea levels in Southern Florida. The more conservative finding suggests that they could jump anywhere from 3 feet by 2050 to 7 feet by 2100. But in January the agency put out new extreme sea level projections its doomsday scenario in other words. In this scenario wed see a 10 to 12 foot rise in sea level in the US by 2100 which would have dramatic consequences for places like Mar a Lago as you can see in the photo above. So what would a 10 foot rise in sea levels mean for Florida? Heres a satellite image of what that would look like. Large swaths of the state are submerged. Miami is entirely flooded along with the rest of Southern Florida There is evidence that average sea levels are already steadily rising in Southern Florida. A 2016 paper found that in the past decade the average rate of sea level rise had tripled from 3 millimeters a year to 9 millimeters. And overall sea levels in Southern Florida had risen about 90 millimeters or 3.5 inches since 2006. Of the 30 most populous US cities that would be negatively affected by extreme sea level rise Climate Central a nonprofit climate science research group found that 19 were located in Florida circled in yellow in the chart below. Scientists dont have a great understanding of how exactly rapidly sea levels will continue to rise or the precise impact on specific areas. But new research that indicates parts of the Antarctic ice sheet may collapse in the next 100 years and that has scientists scrambling to model more extreme scenarios. If the Antarctic ice sheet does melt it could trigger a catastrophic 10 foot spike in sea levels and inundate major US cities like New York and Miami displacing nearly 150 million people worldwide. It may be a lot less stable in Antarctica than we thought said Ben Strauss a vice president at Climate Central. But the truth is we are relatively early in our scientific understanding of how the great ice sheets will respond to warming. Last summer the Guardian investigated Trumps coastal properties to see how at risk each of them were to flooding from rising sea levels. What they found was Mar a Lago was already in serious trouble. The estate was at high risk for flooding during heavy rains and storms with water already pooling on the premises in addition to nearby bridges and roads in Palm Beach. Plus in the next 30 years they estimated there will be 210 days a year where Mar a Lago will be flooded with at least a foot of water. Keren Bolter chief scientist for Coastal Risk Consulting and the firm that analyzed Trumps properties told the Guardian that tidal flooding in the next 30 years could partially submerge some of the clubs luxurious cottages and bungalows. And perhaps even eventually render Trumps Southern White House uninhabitable.	True	False	False	True	False
Thousands gathered in cities across the globe including London Berlin Tokyo and Washington DC to protest anthropogenic climate change and the purported lack of urgency to address it. However there was a remarkable lack of participation from individuals in China the planets worst greenhouse gas emitter minus a protest in Hong Kong. According to the Guardian No protests were authorized in China. However the China Youth Climate Action NetworksZheng Xiaowen said that Chinese youth have their own methods. We also pay attention to the climate and we are also thinking deeply interacting taking action and so many people are very conscientious on this issue she added. Several climate change activists in D.C. decried the U.S. for its role in contributing to climate change despite the fact that the U.S. has made great strides in reducing its carbon output seeing the largest decline in CO2 emissions in the world for 9th time this century in 2017. The largest increase that year came from China. According to a report released by theEnvironmental Protection Agency EPA last year the U.S. reduced its greenhouse gas output by 2.7 percent during President Trumps first year in office. Thanks to President Trumps regulatory reform agenda the economy is booming energy production is surging and we are reducing greenhouse gas emissions from major industrial sources EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said at the time. These achievements flow largely from technological breakthroughs in the private sector not the heavy hand of government. The Trump Administration has proven that federal regulations are not necessary to drive CO2 reductions Wheeler continued. While many around the world are talking about reducing greenhouse gases the U.S. continues to deliver and todays report is further evidence of our action oriented approach he added. Rep. Adam Kinzinger R IL reiterated that point to Greta Thunberg and the other climate kids who testified before theHouse Committee on Foreign Affairs andSelect Committee on the Climate Crisis on Wednesday. Meanwhile as the West looks at options to combat climate change we all know that Chinas global emissions continue to rise. For every ton of carbon dioxide reduced by the United States China adds nearly four times as much Kinzinger said. Today the Chinese account for 30 percent of global emissions. While some may say that the United States needs to be the leader of combating climate change I would say that we already are he continued. Since 2005 global emissions have increased by 20 percent but the United States emissions have decreased by more than the next 12 emission reducing countries combined he added. As Breitbart News reported China is ramping up its coal powered energy supply with the total of future projects now standing at 226.2 gigawatts GW Despite Chinas blatant disregard for the calls of climate change alarmists it has been granted permission to speak at the U.N. international climate summit next week in New York.

New Yorks democratic socialist sweetheart Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is trying very hard to sell her idea of apocalyptic climate change or at least the side of Ocasio Cortez thats serious about climate change ending the world in 12 years is. The other side of her thinks were foolish for believing her claim that climate change will destroy the world in 12 years. She can be very confusing. It seems however that shes very confused herself specifically about how weather works. Recently Washington D.C. suffered from tornado friendly weather pushing AOC into believing that this natural disaster is simply part of the climate change disaster sweeping the globe. She also seemed disturbed at the appearance of casual tornadoes though were not exactly sure what those are and AOC did not elaborate. The climate crisis is real yall Ocasio said on Instagram. Guess were at casual tornadoes in growing regions of the country? The odd proclamation prompted meteorologist Ryan Maue to step in and offer the young Democrat a lesson in what weather is. I thought this was fake but its from Ocasio Cortezs Instagram story tweeted Maue. No idea what she means with casual tornadoes and how this line of severe thunderstorms is proof of any climate crisis he continued. Its just the weather in D.C. In a second tweet Maue pointed out that AOC doesnt seem to know the difference between weather and climate and offered her an easy analogy so that she understood for the future. Weather is what outfit you wear heading out the door tweeted Maue. Climate is your closet wardrobe. Last year climatologistJudith Curry noted that many of the world ending weather scenarios and predictions from politicians like AOC are as good as fantasy novels and told the Daily Caller that its actually impossible to predict what the climate will look like over a decade out. Projections of extreme alarming impacts are very weakly justified to borderline impossible Curry told The Daily Caller News Foundation. Currys latestresearch put together for clients of her consulting company near the end of November looks in detail at projections of sea level rise. Currys ultimate conclusion Some of the worst case scenarios strain credulity. With regards to 21st century climate projections we are dealing with deep uncertainty and we should not be basing our policies based on the assumption that the climate will actually evolve as per predicted Curry told TheDCNF. Climate variability and change is a lot more complex than CO2 as control knob Curry said. No one wants to hear this or actually spend time understanding things Curry said. Of course a lot of this alarmism from Ocasio Cortez is a weak attempt to sell her Green New Deal which already failed to pass through Congress with any yes votes. The point of the Green New Deal isnt necessarily to save the world but to push socialistic standards for America in everything from how we travel to how we farm. However everyone from economists to climate scientists to Democrat politicians have called the Green New Deal a foolish venture and after having reviewed it personally I can say its a piece of legislation thats really only good enough for kindling.

The Five co host Jesse Watters had some tough words for 2020 hopeful Beto O'Rourke after the former Texas representative proposed a 5 trillion climate change plan alongside the claim that the United States only had 10 years left to address the issue. If someone calls you on thephone and says you're going todie in ten years unless you giveme all your money that's ascam Watters said.He'sascam artist andeverybodyknows it. O'Rourke asserted his controversial 10 year prediction while appearing on MSNBC on Monday. He told host Chris Hayes that he sought to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. During that appearance he indicated that he would have to make himself an opponent of the oil and gas industries'interests. We know that certain oil and gas corporations have been fighting public policy on this issue have been hiding their own science and research at the expense of our climate and human life he said. OCASIO CORTEZ CALLS CLIMATE CHANGE OUR 'WORLD WAR II' WARNS THE WORLD WILL END IN 12 YEARS So whenever those two things come in contrast or in opposition I'm always going to choose the people of this country. O'Rourke also said that he wanted people in the fossil fuel industry to act as partners in reaching his goal. You have a 21 trillionU.S. economy thefossil fuel industry runs thiseconomy it'screated all of thiswealth revolutionizedtransportation communications industry lifted people out of poverty Watters said.

Where does he get off thinking he's going to stop human progress? Watters asked. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He went on to speculate that O'Rourke pushed his climate plan because he felt guilty about the American economy's success because he and other liberals have not had enough input in it. O'Rourke's program was an ambitious endeavor similar to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez's D N.Y. Green New Deal which many saw as too expensive and unrealistic. When Ocasio Cortezresponded to O'Rourke's plan she said he didn't have an aggressive enough timeline.	False	True	False	True	False
In February a group of high profile Republicans announced their support for a plan that would tax carbon dioxide emissions in order to slow global warming which they believe to be caused by humans. According to the group which is led by former Secretaries of State James Baker III and George Shultz and former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson their plan would tax fossil fuel companies and redistribute the funds back to Americans in equal portions thereby artificially raising the price of fossil fuels and making renewable energy sources more competitive. Now left wing climate alarmists are seizing on this idea which some say is the only policy idea attempting to limit fossil fuels the American people and the Trump administration would be willing to support. Climate alarmists have long advocated for a carbon tax in varying forms as one possible solution to the purported global warming crisis. In a recent interview with the Scientific American noted climate alarmist James Hansen which the article refers to as the father of climate change awareness said the plan promoted by Republicans is similar to one he developed in 2008 and would be popular with the American people. The only effective way of addressing climate change is to make the price of fossil fuels include their cost to society said Hansen. That could be done in a simple way by collecting a fee from the fossil fuel companies that would gradually rise over timea carbon fee and dividend. I call it a carbon fee because you would give all of the money to the public a dividend to each legal resident Hansen said. have adopted almost precisely as I proposed it in 2008. The starting level of the fee varies from one proposition to anotherI believe that they start at 40 per ton of carbon. suggest 55 per ton yields a dividend of 1000 per legal resident and 3000 for a family with two or more children with one half share for each child a maximum of two half shares per family. Hansen claims by imposing the tax and then redistributing the money to consumers the increased price of gasoline would be offset and Americans would be happy having received thousands of extra dollars from the government. This way it actually stimulates the economy Hansen said. If its a tax taken by the government it makes the government bigger and it depresses the economy. Thats why I object to the Democrats as much as to the Republicans. The only way the public will allow a carbon fee is if you give the money to thempeople dont want to see the price of gasoline at the pump going up. The Washington Post reported on April 4 sources inside the Trump administration say the president is considering including a carbon tax as one way to help raise revenues. The Post also reported the sources claimed the carbon tax proposal is very controversial and that some within the administration are staunchly opposed to it. Carbon taxes are viewed by many on the left as an easy way to price fossil fuels out of the marketplace making renewable energy comparably more affordable. Opponents of the plan say its another form of socialistic wealth distribution that will dramatically raise energy costs. Opponents say energy costs will increase not only because of the tax but also because energy companies will raise prices across the board knowing that all consumers have more money to spend thanks to carbon tax dividends.

The White House shot down rumors Tuesday that administration officials were considering a tax on carbon dioxide emissions. The Washington Post published a story on Tuesday citing two Trump administration officials who said a carbon tax and value added tax or VAT were under consideration as part of a broader tax reform plan. But the White House quickly disavowed the statements allegedly made by the two officials marking the second time in three weeks the Trump administration has had to shoot down carbon tax rumors. As we have said many times the Presidents team is hearing input from experts on all sides of the tax reform debate as we formulate what will ultimately be the Presidents plan to enact the first significant tax reform since 1986 deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement responding to WaPosstory. As of now neither a carbon tax nor a VAT are under consideration Walters said. Walters told reporters in March the Trump administration is not considering a carbon tax after press secretary Sean Spicer waffled on the question. White House officials met with a group of Republicans who back a carbon tax in early February. Spicer did not respond to a request for comment. A small group of Republicans have been pushing a carbon tax for years arguing its more efficient than federal regulations and could be used to offset revenue losses from reductions in tax rates. Most recently old guard Republicans on the Climate Leadership Council CLC met with White House officials to pitch a carbon tax that would start at 40 per ton and rise over the years. CLC says the tax could replace federal regulations and the revenues could be given back to Americans in the form of dividends. Many carbon tax proposals are revenue neutral reads the Councils plan. This proposal goes one step further by shrinking the overall size of government and streamlining the regulatory state. The meeting sparked speculation that the White House was considering a carbon tax as part of a broader tax reform plan. Many carbon tax plans claim to raise 1 trillion over ten years. The White House has shot down such speculation but some administration officials seem intent on telling media outlets a carbon tax is still being considered. Most Republicans dont buy into a carbon tax. They argue its not very conservative to back what would essentially amount to a tax on energy which would effectively raise the price of all goods and services. President Donald Trump told the American Energy Alliance in a survey taken during the campaign that he opposed a carbon tax and the Obama administrations social cost of carbon estimate. Trump signed an executive order in late March rescinding the Obama administrations social cost of carbon estimate. Trump also ordered the Environmental Protection Agency EPA to review and possibly rescind the Clean Power Plan the cornerstone of the former administrations global warming agenda. Conservative activists point out theres no deal to be made on trading federal environmental regulations for a carbon tax since Trumps already promised to roll back 75 percent of federal rules. If the Trump Administration were to endorse this idea they would not only be breaking a campaign commitment but would essentially be negotiating against themselves on regulations said Tom Pyle president of the American Energy Alliance and former member of Trumps transition team.

How Luxury Hotels And Restaurants In Developing Countries Fight Food Waste If you've never considered what happens to the remnants of the fully loaded plate of enchiladas chips and salsa you grab from the buffet at an all inclusive Mexico resort you might be in for a shock. Mexico's Velas Vallarta produces a veritable ton of food waste each day but rather than dumping it into the trash the Puerto Vallarta resort delivers roughly 700 pounds of it each morning to a hog farmer down the road to use as feed. Much of what doesn't go to the pigs is composted on site and then used to fertilize the resort's verdant gardens. Ultimately the combo of food waste leaves and grass trimmings are returned to the soil while diverting waste from Mexico's overloaded landfills. Compost is also shared with staff for use at their homes. The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that nearly a quarter of food purchases in hotels and restaurants are simply thrown away. While food waste is a hot topic in the U.S. it's a particular challenge in low income nations where food is sometimes a scarce resource to begin with. Some resorts are doing their part to address it even when governmental regulations and a general lack of awareness make that difficult. In Brazil food safety regulations prevent restaurants from giving away food yet 52 million Brazilians are still threatened by food insecurity according to 2014 research by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. Meanwhile the country produces almost more food waste than any other nation with 40000 tons wasted each day according to research by the Brazilian Company of Agriculture. That amount of food could feed 19 million people. But in the booming city of Rio de Janeiro a luxury hotel has been turning trash into treasure for more than a decade long before food waste was at the forefront of anyone's mind. The glamorous Belmond Copacabana Palace you know the place where you might see Madonna or Mick Jagger hanging off the balcony was among the country's first hotels to implement a restaurant waste management system in 2008. Today Copacabana Palace recycles more than 1800 gallons of cooking oil and composts nearly all of its food waste but not before crushing it to reduce its volume by 88 percent. For many hotels simple knowledge of the issue has resulted in greater observance from staff and ultimately less waste. When Soneva Fushi a luxury resort in the Maldives conducted a comprehensive food waste audit in 2016 employees sorted weighed and recorded waste for a full week ultimately establishing exactly how much food was wasted per guest down to the gram. I think part of the benefit of a detailed audit like this is that it increases everyone's mindfulness about what they are doing with food says Gordon Jackson the manager of the resort's Waste to Wealth initiative. This has really helped everybody throughout the food and beverage team and the organization as a whole just to think about what they are doing. Since the audit the resort has seen a 50 percent reduction in the amount of waste sent to compost. While it's easier for large hotels and resorts to fund audits and enlist comprehensive waste management systems smaller properties have found low cost ways to reduce their environmental footprint too. When Anita Ritter opened her Island Hideout resort in Koh Yao Noi Thailand a year and a half ago she was shocked by how challenging waste management was on her small sleepy island but a few innovative ideas have brought the resort's food waste to almost zero. Ritter composts much of her property's organic waste to use as fertilizer but she's found uses for compost byproducts too. Compost juice sometimes called bokashi gets a new life as a cleaning fluid used at the resort. It is a very efficient cleaner for clogged drains perfect to clean toilets and sinks and is a very good odor remover she says. Leftover Kaffir limes used in the property's homemade limeade are repurposed in cleaning products. It helps give other islanders something to think about Ritter explains. As we use and reuse things it gives us some social engagement status. In May I experienced one hotel's efforts firsthand as I stood on the roof at ITC Maurya a hotel in Delhi. It was more than 100 degrees outside and flies swarmed above vats of leftover naan and curry from the hotel's five restaurants including Bukhara arguably the world's most famous Indian restaurant. Next to the putrid mix stood a stainless steel tank full of in a sense money all in the form of decaying rotting food. That pricy leftover food the hotel produces more than 1300 pounds of it per day was in the process of being converted to biogas a methane and carbon dioxide mix that's a result of decomposing food. Ultimately the resulting biogas powers the staff cafeteria. The hotel also collects around 100 pounds of waste from the community each day using the same process to convert it into fuel. ITC Maurya's BioUrja plant was a more significant investment than reusing lime peels and bokashi. The plant which consists of a giant digester a pressure vessel scrubbers and an automation panel was installed in June 2016 and cost around 45 lakh or roughly 65000. Still the hotel expects the project to break even in about four years. In the meantime the digester will chug along reducing waste one bowl of leftover dal at a time.	False	False	False	False	False
HAZARD Ky. AP A coalition of left leaning states and environmental groups are vowing to fight the Trump administration's move to kill an Obama era effort to limit carbon emissions from coal fired power plants. Speaking Monday in the coal mining state of Kentucky Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt said he would be issuing a new set of rules overriding the Clean Power Plan the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's drive to curb global climate change. The war on coal is over Pruitt declared adding that no federal agency should ever use its authority to declare war on any sector of our economy. It was not immediately clear if Pruitt would seek to issue a new rule without congressional approval which Republicans had criticized the Obama administration for doing. Pruitt's rule wouldn't become final for months and is then highly likely to face a raft of legal challenges. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was among those who said they will sue. The Trump Administration's persistent and indefensible denial of climate change and their continued assault on actions essential to stemming its increasing devastation is reprehensible and I will use every available legal tool to fight their dangerous agenda said Schneiderman a Democrat. For Pruitt getting rid of the Clean Power Plan will mark the culmination of a long fight he began as the elected attorney general of Oklahoma. Pruitt was among about two dozen attorney generals who sued to stop Obama's 2014 push to limit carbon emissions stymieing the limits from ever taking effect. Closely aligned with the oil and gas industry in his home state Pruitt rejects the consensus of scientists that man made emissions from burning fossil fuels are the primary driver of global climate change. President Donald Trump who appointed Pruitt and shares his skepticism of established climate science promised to kill the Clean Power Plan during the 2016 campaign as part of his broader pledge to revive the nation's struggling coal mines. In his order Tuesday Pruitt is expected to declare that the Obama era rule exceeded federal law by setting emissions standards that power plants could not reasonably meet. Pruitt appeared at an event with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at Whayne Supply in Hazard Kentucky a company that sells coal mining supplies. The store's owners have been forced to lay off about 60 percent of its workers in recent years. While cheering the demise of the Clean Power Plan as a way to stop the bleeding McConnell conceded most of those lost jobs are never coming back. A lot of damage has been done said McConnell a Kentucky Republican. This doesn't immediately bring everything back but we think it stops further decline of coal fired plants in the United States and that means there will still be some market here. Obama's plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions. The Supreme Court put the plan on hold last year following legal challenges by industry and coal friendly states. Even so the plan helped drive a recent wave of retirements of coal fired plants which are also being squeezed by low cost natural gas and renewable power. In the absence of stricter federal regulations curbing greenhouse gas emissions many states have issued their own mandates promoting energy conservation. The withdrawal of the Clean Power Plan is the latest in a series of moves by Trump and Pruitt to dismantle Obama's legacy on fighting climate change including the delay or roll back of rules limiting levels of toxic pollution in smokestack emissions and wastewater discharges from coal burning power plants. On Thursday Trump nominated former coal industry lobbyist Andrew Wheeler to serve as Pruitt's top deputy at EPA one of several recent political appointees at the agency with direct ties to the fossil fuel interests. The president announced earlier this year that he will pull the United States out of the landmark Paris climate agreement. Nearly 200 countries have committed to combat global warming by reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. This president has tremendous courage Pruitt said Monday. He put America first and said to the rest of the world we are going to say no and exit the Paris Accord. That was the right thing to do. Despite the rhetoric about saving coal government statistics show that coal mines currently employ only about 52000 workers nationally a modest 4 percent uptick since Trump became president. Those numbers are dwarfed by the jobs created by building such clean power infrastructure as wind turbines and solar arrays. Trump is not just ignoring the deadly cost of pollution he's ignoring the clean energy deployment that is rapidly creating jobs across the country said Michael Brune executive director of the Sierra Club. Associated Press writer Michael Biesecker reported from Washington. Follow him at This story has been corrected to show the percentage of coal jobs created under Trump was 4 percent.

The City of Lights Paris has been illuminated in recent days by cars set alight by thousands of protesting Yellow Vestslargely middle class people who earn their living by driving or who commute to get to work. The cause of their ire is a scheduled 25 cents per gallon increase in gas taxes and about 10 cents on diesel to fight climate change. French President Macron deeply unpopular just reversed course on the new green taxParisians are already paying about 7.06 per gallon for gasoline almost half of that in taxes. If Paris streets burned over a proposed25 cents per gallon climate change tax imagine the global conflagration over a 49 per gallon tax. Thats what a United Nations special climate report calls for in 12 years with a carbon tax of 5500 per tonequal to 49 per gallon of gasoline or diesel. Thats about 100 times todays average state and federal motor fuels tax. By 2100 the U.N. estimates that a carbon tax of 27000 per ton is needed240 per gallonto limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Of course that isnt going to happen. The economic wreckage of such a punitive tax would plunge the global economy into a permanent depressionand thats assuming politicians could enact such huge tax increases over the will of their voters. Keep in mind that the unrest in France was triggered by a looming 25 cent hike which is a little less than 10 more in taxes than French drivers already pay. To meet the 49 per gallon tax hike recommended by the U.N. fuel taxes in France would have to go up 17 fold. The violent protests in France were fueled by intense frustration felt by a middle class that sees itself squeezed. They dont earn enough to be part of the elite unconcerned with fuel taxes but they work hard enough that they dont qualify for the generous welfare benefits handed out to the nations poor and to newly arrived immigrants from Africa and the Middle East. Here in America Republicans in Congress passed a resolution against carbon taxes over the summer while Democrats embraced the concept in their party platform. Some incoming members of the new Democratic majority in the House are calling to create a select committee to map out a Green New Deal that would move the U.S. toward using 100 renewable energy for the electric grid while guaranteeing jobs for everyone. In the meantime opinion polls indicate that 54 of Americans do not believe global warming will cause major problems within their lifetimes. So how do climate activists get their way? Some openly talk of imposing authoritarian governance to override democratic institutions. Former NASA climate researcher James Hansen suggested in 2007 that the democratic process does not work. Other scientists have called the threat of global warming the equivalent of war while calling for the crushing of dissent and the jailing of deniers. Those who see climate change as a dire and urgent threat have some work to do to convince voters in the Western democracies to give up their way of life in exchange for unspecified benefits of a slightly less warm worldand thats assuming China India and over a billion people in Africa can be convinced not to try to pull themselves out of povertysomething that may only be done with greater use of fossil fuels. Thus one well worn tactic employed by those who would presume to tell the rest of us how to live where to live and how to workall of the good of the planet of courseis the alarmist study making copious use of lies of omission and commission. An example of the former can be seen in the new National Climate Assessment. The reports first chapter lists recent natural disasters citing this summers deadly Carr Fire in California as an example. But while the report seeks to link wildfire to climate change it glosses over the real reason fires have grown in intensity and size the 30 years of increased environmental restrictions on logging brush clearance and preventive burns that caused a massive and dangerous fuel buildupa problem that was predicted years ago and has nothing to do with global warming. The sin of commission in the service of scaring middle class voters into doing that theyre supposed to can be seen in an economic modeling study paid for by our federal tax dollars as well as underwritten by two billionaires who would be president Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg. Here were told that the U.S. economy will take a 10 hit by 2100 unless we reduce our carbon emissions. Two problems though the authors assume the worst case and least likely scenario with average temperatures more than 14 degrees Fahrenheit hotter by 2100 and they derive two thirds of their economic losses estimate by claiming a large amount of premature deaths due to the hotter temperatures. The latter claim is highly problematic as death rates in regions far hotter than in the U.S. arent meaningfully different when accounting for the standard of living. Why? People adapt rather easily. This makes for scary headlines in the New York Times or CNN but it is far from sound science or even good economics. The bottom line is this economic freedomthe kind you get with a large middle classleads to prosperity economic growth and technological innovation. And its these three things wealth growth and technology which allows humans to thrive on planet Earth not 240 per gallon fuel taxes imposed by an elite that cares not for the masses.

Forget the Golden State. California should be called the Smoggy State. Eight of the USA's 10most polluted cities in terms of ozone pollution are in California according to the American Lung Association's annual State of the Air report released Wednesday. The Los AngelesLong Beach area took the dubious distinction of being the nation's most ozone polluted cityas it has for nearly the entire 19 year history of the report. Overall the report said about133 million Americans more than four of 10 live with unhealthful levels of air pollution placing them at risk for premature death and other serious health effects such as lung cancer asthma attacks cardiovascular damage and developmental and reproductive harm. We still have a lot to do in this country to clean up air pollution said Lyndsay Moseley Alexander director of the Association's Healthy Air Campaign. The report looked at pollution levels from 2014 to 2016. Ozone pollution was worse overall in this report than it was in last year's report. Bakersfield Calif. wasin second place for ozone pollution. Other California cities on the list include Fresno Sacramento and San Diego. The only non California metro areas in the top 10 list were Phoenix and New York City. Of the 10 most polluted cities seven cities did worse in this year's report including Los Angeles and the New York City metro area. More President Trump directs EPA to ease air quality rules he says suffocates industry Near record setting heat from our changing climate has resulted in dangerous levels of ozone in many cities across the country making ozone an urgent health threat for millions of Americans Lung Association President and CEO Harold P. Wimmersaid. Smog forms on warm sunny days and is made worse fromchemicals that exit vehicle tailpipes and from power plant and industrial smokestacks.Warmer temperatures make ozone more likely to form. This adds to the evidence that a changing climate makes it harder to reduce ozone pollution and protect human health Alexandersaid Bakersfield took the top spot in a list of cities with another variety of air pollution small particulate matter aka soot.Increased heat changes in climate patterns drought and wildfires many related to climate change contributed to the high number of days with unhealthy particulate matter. SinceCalifornia is known for its strict environmental regulations why are so many cities from the state typically on this list?It's because the state would be far worse off without its strict laws on tailpipe pollution and eliminating coal fired power plants. California has done more than any other state to counteract air pollution the Lung Association said. With this report the Lung Association also calls out Congress and the Environmental Protection Agency EPA for ongoing threats to the nations air quality including steps to roll back or weaken enforcement of the Clean Air Act. EPA administrator Scott Pruitt hastaken many steps to roll back or put in loopholes to the Clean Air Act Alexander said adding thattheassociation is concerned and we will continueto fight forhealthy air she said. Some good news in the report was that particulate pollution generally continued to improve in 2014 16 the report said. This was true for both short term particulate pollution and for year round particulate pollution. For year round particle pollution Fairbanks Alaska was the most polluted city. TheLung Association also lists the nation's cleanest cities meaning ones that experience no high ozone or high particulate pollution days. The nation's cleanest cities are Bellingham Wash.

CNN Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed the state's first chief science officer on Monday marking what he called the state's commitment to science based solutions. DeSantis appointed Thomas Frazer a biologist who has been director of the University of Florida's School of Natural Resources and Environment since 2012 and previously worked as acting director of the UF Water Institute In the new position he will coordinate Florida's research data and scientific work and make sure officials have the scientific analysis they need to tackle the state's environmental problems. Frazer's research has looked at pollution's effects on water. He's also worked on research involving climate change. He's been on the faculty advisory committee with the UF Climate Institute and served as chairman of the Climate Science Faculty Committee. Climate change will be a part of his office's mission. We have to look at the facts of what is going on in the environment and can we bring science to bear on those changes happening now and in the future? Frazer said. Asked whether he thought climate change was a threat to Florida DeSantis said the issue was politicized but noted that he considers sea level rise a serious threat. My environmental policy is just to do things that benefit Floridians. And the idea that you're signing up for some type of agenda I don't want to ... send a signal that that's what I'm doing because I'm not doing that DeSantis said . This is what we're going to do. We're going to do what works. DeSantis said the appointment keeps with his promise to make sound science a Florida priority. As one of Florida's leading environmental researchers Dr. Frazer understands the unique water issues facing our state and the actions we must take to solve them he said Monday. Since day one my administration has been laser focused on addressing our pressing environmental challenges. On January 10 DeSantis signed an Executive Order that pledged to secure 2.5 billion over the next four years to restore the Everglades. It created the Blue Green Algae Task Force and promised to work with local communities to invest in green infrastructure. It also created the chief science officer position. Frazer will have his work cut out for him. In July Scott declared a state of emergency for several counties to help local governments deal with an unprecedented toxic algal bloom that killed thousands of marine animals including dolphins and manatees. The bloom which affected more than 100 miles of Florida shoreline also sent people to the doctor with respiratory problems and eye issues. below sea level by 2100 Sea level rise alone is projected to outpace the global average for Southeast Florida. The region could see nearly a foot more of water in the short term. There's also a chance that more than 346 billion in property value will bebelow sea level by 2100 studies show Frazer said he's honored by the appointment. Our environment and waterways make Florida unique he said. I look forward to working with the governor and the Department of Environmental Protection on ways we can use sound science and research to improve our state's water quality and protect the environment.

Deforestation of Brazil's Amazon rainforest increased by 29.5 in 12 months the highest rate since 2008 the country's space agency reports. The rainforest lost 9762 sq km 3769 sq miles of its vegetation between August 2018 and July 2019 Inpe says. Far right President Jair Bolsonaro has in the past questioned the accuracy of data provided by Inpe. Scientists say the Amazon has suffered losses at an accelerated rate since Mr Bolsonaro took office in January. They say the president favours development over conservation. Who is Brazil's new leader Jair Bolsonaro? Mr Bolsonaro who in July dismissed a similar Inpe report as flawed has not commented on the latest data. As the largest rainforest in the world the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. Over the past decade previous governments in Brazil had managed to reduce deforestation with concerted action by federal agencies and a system of fines. But Mr Bolsonaro and his ministers have criticised the penalties and overseen a dramatic fall in confiscations of timber and convictions for environmental crimes.	False	False	False	False	False
Just a few hours before the second round of 2020 Democratic presidential contenders are set to face off dozens of local activists in Miami Florida held an Underwater Climate Rally calling for more discussion about climate change at the second Democratic debate. A coalition of local environmental groups organized the march to the Arsht Center in Miami where this round of debates is being held with marchers sporting signs calling for a specific climate change debate and pushing for the Green New Deal. Melissa Baldwin co organizer of Miami Climate Month which organized the rally says from the moment she and her fellow organizers found out the first debate would be in Miami they wanted to put a spotlight on climate change because you cant come to Miami without talking about climate change. Climate change and fossil fuels have already disturbed the daily lives of Floridians. Sea level rise and warming temperatures threaten cities like Miami.

This isnt something in the future Ross says. This is something thats happening now and needs to be addressed now. At the first 2020 Democratic debate on Wednesday night Democrats spent less than 10 minutes talking about climate change. Though not an extensive conversation that was still more time spent talkingabout climate change than in all of threedebates combined between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in 2016.

WASHINGTON AP Democrats including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York are calling for a Green New Deal intended to transform the U.S. economy to combat climate change and create thousands of jobs in renewable energy. The freshman lawmaker and veteran Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts are teaming up on the plan which aims to eliminate the U.S. carbon footprint by 2030. A joint resolution drafted by Ocasio Cortez and Markey sets a goal to meet 100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean renewable and zero emission energy sources including dramatic increases in wind and solar power. A news conference at the Capitol is set for Thursday the day they introduce the resolution. While setting lofty goals the plan does not explicitly call for eliminating the use of fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas a nod to pragmatism that may disappoint some of Ocasio Cortezs strongest supporters. Even so their Green New Deal goes far beyond the Clean Power Plan proposed by President Barack Obama. President Donald Trump has scrapped Obamas plan which imposed emissions limits on coal fired power plants as a job killer. The Democrats are likely to meet resistance to their proposal in Congress especially in the Republican controlled Senate. Trump who has expressed doubts about climate change also is likely to oppose it. The resolution marks the first time Ocasio Cortez and other lawmakers have attached legislative language onto the Green New Deal a concept that until now has been largely undefined other than as a call for urgent action to head off catastrophic climate change and create jobs. Several Democratic presidential hopefuls have embraced the idea of a Green New Deal without saying exactly what it means. Ocasio Cortez said in a statement that the plan will create unprecedented levels of prosperity and wealth for all while ensuring economic and environmental justice and security. She calls for a World War II scale mobilization that includes high quality education and health care clean air and water and safe affordable housing. Answering critics who call the plan unrealistic Ocasio Cortez says that when President John F. Kennedy wanted to go to the moon by the end of the 1960s people said it was impossible. She also cites Franklin D. Roosevelts New Deal Lyndon B. Johnsons Great Society and the interstate highway system begun under Dwight D. Eisenhower as examples of American know how and capability. While focusing on renewable energy Ocasio Cortez said the plan would include existing nuclear power plants but block new nuclear plants. Nuclear power does not emit greenhouse gases which contribute to global warming. The resolution does not include a price tag but some Republicans predict it would cost in the trillions of dollars. They denounced the plan at House hearings on climate change on Wednesday. The Green New Deal would be paid for the same way we paid for the original New Deal World War II the bank bailouts tax cuts for the rich and decades of war with public money appropriated by Congress Ocasio Cortez said. Government can take an equity stake in Green New Deal projects so the public gets a return on its investment she said.	False	False	False	False	False
Protesters were arrested in Washington after blocking an oil train by erecting a pop up garden of sunflowers and lying down on the train tracks. The group was protesting a proposed oil terminal and all other fossil fuel infrastructure in the state. Two people were arrested Monday during a protest in downtown Vancouver Washington held by the activist group Shut Down Fossil Fuels. Protesters locked their arms into large sunflower pots and laid down on train tracks calling on Washington Governor Jay Inslee D to reject the proposed Vancouver Tesoro Savage Oil Terminal and all other proposed fossil fuel infrastructure in the State of Washington the group said in a press release. The protesters were blocking a BNSF train carrying Bakken Crude Oil a highly volatile oil that caused a train to explode in Mosier Oregon last June. Jessie Braverman the groups media liaison told RT that around 25 people showed up at the train tracks to address climate change and let the governor know that if he isnt going to stop the terminal than we will. Our community and our planet are under attack yet the political response has been amoral and inadequate. We were here on the tracks a year after the Mosier oil train derailment and nothing has changed Braverman said in a statement. The trains are still coming and new fossil fuel projects are still being proposed were in the midst of a worldwide climate emergency and were fighting back. Braverman confirmed that two people were arrested during the protest and they are still being held in jail. She also said that there had been no word from the governor whom they had been attempting to contact throughout the day. According to the Associated Press the tracks were cleared after an hour. In 2014 the state of Washington passed legislation to increase track and hazardous material inspections require oil spill contingency plans increase funding for prevention and cleanup of oil spills and improve safety at crossings along oil train routes. However Inslee said that states are limited in what we can do in creating regulations for interstate railroads. Railroads engage in interstate commerce which means the buck stops with the federal government. While federal regulators acknowledge the risks of crude by rail they have taken few steps toward increasing safety Inslee wrote in an op ed for the Columbian last year. The combination of federal preemption and federal inaction is unacceptable. Inslee urged Congress and the US Department of Transportation to implement even tougher regulations including lower speed limits for high hazard flammable trains and to use safer cars that are strong enough to protect volatile contents from the heat of a fire or the impact of a collision. However the group said that Inslee has failed to craft an emissions reduction strategy and the state continues to move towards a dizzying array of new fossil fuel developments. If I can stop an oil train Governor Jay Inslee can stop an oil terminal Chris one of the protesters said in a statement. Ultimately Shut Down Fossil Fuels is calling for an end to oil trains oil terminals and all fossil fuels. Its now or never. Were up against the wire and nobody no politician no agency no industry is stepping up to resolve the climate crisis Mike one of the protesters locked to a flower pot said in a statement. Its time for the people to step up to resolve this crisis before we run out of time. Sophie Scholl another media liaison for the group told RT that there has been a second blockade of a train up north following the arrests in downtown Vancouver.	False	False	False	False	False
The United States is still reeling from last years megadisasters. Puerto Rico lingers in the longest blackout in US history after Hurricane Maria tore through the island and the scorched earth left behind from record breaking fires in California is now causing floods and mudslides. The Federal Emergency Management Agency which was on the front lines of many of these calamities had to go back to Congress last September to ask for billions more dollars to handle the gargantuan relief efforts. With some of the dust settled its clear that the events in 2017 fit the pattern of extreme weather we expect as average global temperatures go up with strong climate change signals emerging in fires and rainfall. FEMA has and will continue to respond to climate change influenced disasters. But the agencys new strategic plan for 2018 2022 released Thursday doesnt mention climate change or global warming at all. Thats despite the fact that the 38 page document projects more frequent and more expensive disasters. This is a glaring omission from an agency that deals with anticipating and responding to weather extremes driven in part by a changing climate. The damages from the hurricanes heat waves wildfires and tornadoes in 2017 cost at least 306 billion. Disaster costs are expected to continue to increase due to rising natural hazard risk decaying critical infrastructure and economic pressures that limit investments in risk resilience according to the document. FEMA did signal that it wants to invest more in pre disaster mitigation which may or may not include climate change. But it wasnt so coy in its previous 2014 2018 strategic plan which noted that the agency will also ensure that future risks including those influenced by climate change are effectively integrated into the Agencys risk assessment resources and processes. Dropping climate change from FEMAs strategic plan is just the latest part of the Trump administrations long pattern of erasing climate change as a public policy issue across the federal government. Agencies including the Department of Energy the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior have removed climate change language from many of their websites. Other agencies have limited access to policy and technical documents dealing with climate change. And some government research grant applications faced extra scrutiny and rejection for mentioning the double C word. Its not just rhetoric. President Trump wants the United States to back out of the Paris climate agreement and the EPA is working to undo the main policy for restricting greenhouse gases the Clean Power Plan. The White Houses latest budget proposal seeks a 72 percent cut to clean energy research and reduces FEMAs budget by almost 600 million from 16.1 billion. The recent personnel shake up across the federal government doesnt bode well for the fight against climate change either. Rex Tillerson who was fired as secretary of state this week wanted the United States to remain in the Paris deal. His likely replacement Mike Pompeo doesnt believe humanity is warming the planet. And former White House adviser George David Banks who suggested that Trump could rejoin the Paris agreement resigned last month after he failed to get a security clearance due to past marijuana use. The net result is that the Trump administration is doing little to either mitigate or adapt to rising temperatures. And now homeowners many of whom received disaster relief money from FEMA are rebuilding in floodplains and high fire risk areas. It seems FEMA doesnt want to build on this history of climate disasters. Now it looks like were condemned to repeat it.	False	False	False	False	False
Democrat presidential candidate and billionaire Tom Steyer once again vowed to declare a state of emergency over the climate crisis America faces during the sixth Democrat presidential debate at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles California. I am hoping that we in fact that we will do what I am suggesting that we do which is declare a state of emergency on day one of my presidency Steyer said in regards to the relocation of families under certain living conditions in America. I believe I am the only person here who will say unequivocally this is my number one priority Steyer continued. I know that we have to deal with this crisis. I know that we have to deal with it from the standpoint of environmental justice. Steyer then claimed he had previously taken on oil companies and beaten them on environmental laws and pushed clean energy across this country. He also stated that he had prevented pipelines and fossil fuel plants. Steyer then shifted focus to cleaning up the air and water in the black and brown communities where our pollution is concentrated and claimed it would create millions of middle class union jobs. Steyer also called on Mayor Pete Buttigieg another Democrat presidential hopeful to put more emphasis on climate change saying the people in his generation understand that this is a crisis that we have to go on right now and reinvent America. In addition to what he plans to do in regards to climate change Steyer also stated at a previous Democrat debate that he would force American towns to accept new affordable housing in certain areas.

WASHINGTON President Trumps decision to back out of the Paris climate accord is a blow to environmental activists but the nation's steady years long reduction in greenhouse gas emissionsthat contribute to global warming wont suddenly stop. Utility companies have announced plans to fully or partially close more than a half dozen coal fired power plants since Trump took office fewer than five months ago taking some of the nations largest greenhouse gas emitters off line. AndWall Street fund managers and large businesses are moving away from fossil fuels due to market conditions further contributing to increased use of cleaner energy sources. Since 2010 more than 250 coal fired power plants have closed in the U.S. On Wednesday Exxon Mobil shareholders voted against the boards recommendation to require the company publicly report on the risks to its business posed by climate change. The United States is making progress said John Coequyt Global Climate Policy Director for the Sierra Club. Were moving forward. We believe the rest of the world will do the same. Trump has already taken unilateral steps to roll back regulations that were designed to implement the Paris agreement including reversing President Obama's Clean Power Plan rule that sought to lower greenhouseemissions. Trumpcampaigned on a promise to withdraw the U.S.from the accord saying it would lead to higher energy prices and hurt domesticbusinesses from being able to compete globally. As president I have one obligation and that obligation is to the Americanpeople Trump said during a speech in theRose Garden announcingthe decision. The Paris Accord would undermineour economy hamstring ourworkers weaken oursovereignty impose unacceptable legal risk and put us at a permanentdisadvantageto the other countiesof the world. The internationalagreement which was signed in 2015 and went into effect seven months ago is considered a major part theenvironmental legacy of the Obama administration. Michael A. Needham chief executive officer of the conservative Heritage Action for America applauded the president's move. Withdrawal from the agreement marks a critical step in unraveling former President Obamas destructive legacy Needham said. Not only did Obama make this agreement without approval from Congress but in doing so he handed more control of Americas energy to foreign officials. Experts say pulling out of the accord will slow but hardly stop the momentum that's been building to keepa global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels. Under current policy the U.S. is still set to come within striking distance of meeting its 2020 goal under a prior U.N. climate change accordto reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17 below 2005 levels according to a report by energy analysts the Rhodium Group. But the analysis said withdrawing from the accord makes it very unlikely the U.S. will meet the26 28 target set out under the Paris deal. The exit from the accord will allow states such as California and New York to play a leading role in meeting climate change targets. California for example has stood out with its toughest in the nation vehicle emissions laws that often effectively establish auto industrystandards nationwide. California Gov. Jerry Brown said he hopes Trump's insane move to back out of the Paris accord will spur others to action. California will resist he told reporters on a conferencecall after Trump's announcement.California is all in. We're on the field ready for battle and while our president may be AWOL in the battle against climate change we're not.	False	False	False	False	False
We havent heard much about a national cap and trade system to curb carbon emissions since plans for one died in Congress about a decade ago. But tonight at the CNN climate forum Beto ORourke the former congressman from Texas revived the idea as his preferred method of pricing carbon. Under such a system the government issues a limited number of allowances or permits to companies and other entities that emit carbon dioxide essentially creating a cap on emissions. California and states across the Eastern Seaboard have used the system for the past several years to reduce emissions from the power sector. In the 5 trillion climate plan that Mr. ORourke released in April he indicated he would pursue some type of carbon pricing to reach his goal of net zero emissions by 2050 but didnt specify an approach. In response to a question from Priya Subberwal a New York University student Mr. ORourke made clear that he prefers cap and trade over a straight tax on carbon. We should certainly price carbon. I think the best possible path to do that is through a cap and trade system he said. Its the best way to send a pricing signal. The revenue from a cap and trade program he said would be reinvested in helping communities move toward clean energy. Mr. ORourke promised to surprise surprise re enter the Paris agreement on Day 1. He also pledged to lead the world in going well beyond the Paris climate agreement prevent new oil and gas leases on federal lands and bring back Obama era climate regulations like fuel economy standards and restrictions on coal fired power plants. The former Texas congressman was also one of the few candidates who explicitly tied Hurricane Dorian to newly proposed policies. He called for extending temporary protected status to anyone who wants to seek shelter here from the Bahamas which has been overwhelmed by the hurricane. Asylum laws Mr. ORourke said should include those who have been impacted by climate change. Its the right thing to do. Mr. ORourke was less clear about whether he believes people in his home state of Texas should be prevented from living in vulnerable flood areas. He said the government should help people move but avoided answering a question from the moderator Don Lemon about whether some areas were simply too risky for human habitation. One area where the Texan came down strong No limits on the meat industry despite calls from the United Nations for people to change their diet to avoid more damage to global land use. I reject any notion that we have to radically or fundamentally change how we eat or what we eat I think we just have to be more responsible in the way that we do it and the best way to do that is to allow the market to respond by setting a price on carbon he said.

A federal reportlast year found that about a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions in the United States come from fossil fuel extraction on federal land. As the Trump administration continues its push to expand such development top candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination agree that Americas public land must be a tool in the fight against climate change not a contributor to the problem. During CNNs marathon town hall on climate change Wednesday candidates vowed to end oil gas and coal leasing on federal land as part of a shared goal to decarbonizing the economy and prevent catastrophic warming. Sen. Kamala Harris D Calif. and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julin Castro said they would also work to expand federally protected acreage. We actually need to undo the damage that this administration has done and then expand the lands that were protecting in our country Castro said. We can do that. Most of the 10 Democratic candidates who appeared on stage Wednesday have released climate plans that call for reversing Trumps sweeping land rollbacks safeguarding new sites or fully funding the popular Land and Water Conservation Fund which uses offshore fossil fuel revenue to protect natural areas and water resources. Castro Harris Sen. Cory Booker D N.J. and former Vice President Joe Biden have all committed to working toward protecting 30 of Americas land and water by 2030. The next president must be ready to lead the climate response we need to see on our shared lands and waters Huntley said. If we are going to keep pace with what science demands we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions on our public lands while also restoring protections for threatened forests from the Southern Appalachians to Alaskas Tongass National Forest. Ahead of Wednesdays forum Harris released a 10 trillion climate plan that calls for diversifying the marine and land ecosystems that we protect and targeting biodiversity hotspots and critical wildlife corridors as well as using existing presidential authorities to set aside critical landscapes. Bidens plan promises to permanently protect areas like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge a pristine Alaska wilderness that the Trump administration is working to open to oil drilling and to set up programs to reforest and expand renewable energy on federal lands. Castros 10 trillion climate plan also released this week calls for designating new national monuments parks and wildlife refuge and outlines a so called Green Opportunity Corps that would put 15000 young adults to work in areas like public land conservation. He is the only candidate to put out an animal and wildlife welfare policy which seeks to end euthanasia for household dogs and cats and strengthen protections for endangered species. We need to connect the dots Castro said Wednesday. Ive connected the dots of actually preserving more of our lands both for the benefit of wildlife and for our benefit to combat climate change. Sen. Elizabeth Warren D Mass. was not asked Wednesday about how she would approach Americas public lands and waters despite being the only candidate to release a comprehensive plan specific to protecting them. Her policy vision unveiled in April includes overturning Trumps land rollbacks a moratorium on oil and gas leases on federal land and recruiting 10000 youth and veterans for a 21st Century Civilian Conservation Corps. Its not enough to end our public lands contribution to climate change Warren wrote in an announcement at the time. We have an enormous opportunity to make them a part of the climate solution and for both economic and environmental reasons we should take it. All 10 candidates that participated in the CNN climate forum have voiced support for the Green New Deal the landmark resolution unveiled in February by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D N.Y. and Sen. Ed Markey D Mass. and that outlined lofty goals of reaching net zero emissions by midcentury. Supporters of the Green New Dealhave said public land is key to its success. The plan calls for ensuring that public lands waters and oceans are protected and restoring and protecting threatened endangered and fragile ecosystems. Questions posed to candidates on Wednesday varied and not all were asked about public land and conservation. But nearly all have policy proposals that drive home the need for the nation to be a better environmental steward. Former Rep. Beto ORourke Texas says he would go beyond previous presidents to protect our most wild beautiful and biodiverse places for generations to come including more of the Arctic and of our sensitive landscapes and seascapes than ever before.

Over the last two weeks weve heard a lot of folderol and bambosh about Republicans conservatives Texans etc. not believing in science because recent hurricanes have been bad and climate change is causing it and blah blah blah. As you can probably tell I dont think much of all that. We had a historic lull in hurricanes until the lull was over. Once the hurricanes started back up so did the claim that climate change caused the hurricanes just as the scientists predicted the same scientists who didnt predict the lull. Similarly California had a historic drought that recently came to an end. Most of the climate models say that California should get wetter because of global warming. But that didnt stop President Obama and others from suggesting the dry spell was a symptom of climate change. Then when California experienced huge amounts of precipitation suddenly the models were prescient. But look I dont want to debate global warming because a its boring to me b you get screamed at by people who act like we have seconds to act before the world ends and c you or at least I also get screamed at by people who insist its all a complete hoax. For those interested Im basically in the Matt Ridley lukewarmercamp. Now back to my point. This whole dont believe in science canard amounts to ackamarackus bordering on flimflam. Even if you were a 100 percent denier of climate change that wouldnt necessarily mean you dont believe in science. Indeed many of the hardcore rejectionists I know are really really really into the science of climate change tell the guys at CEI they dont believe in science I dare you. They just tend to think the prevailing consensus is a politically and journalistically contrived sham. But even if you are a denier without being a science dork that doesnt necessarily mean you dont believe in science. Rejecting one scientific finding whether accurate or inaccurate doesnt mean you must reject all science never mind suggest that you dont believe in it. To be honest I dont know what people who say you dont believe in science think they mean when they say it. Climate deniers dont insist the world is flat though I have to assume flat earthers have unconventional views on atmospheric science. They dont refuse to take medical treatment or prescribed drugs. They have faith that the internal combustion engine is based on sound science. Etc. Often when I stupidly engage people who sincerely claim that Republicans or conservatives dont believe in science I like to point out that many liberals and leftists have problems with science too. People who want to ban golden rice or other GMOs people who deny that a fetus is a whole human people who insist fetal pain is a myth people who get outraged by claims that say men cant get pregnant. The list goes on and on. And yet I dont argue that Democrats dont believe in science. You know why? Because that would be stupid. Anyway what brought all this to mind was a story in the Washington Post this morning. Apparently researchers claim they can tell whether youre a homosexual or lesbian by using facial recognition software. The results arent perfect they claim but the computers apparently do better than humans at guessing which team you play for or secretly want to play for but dont. Not surprisingly gay rights groups are angry! They dont like it! And to be honest I can understand why. But thats not the point. Both GLAAD and Human Rights Watch cant seem to decide whether the science is bad because its fake and flawed or bad because it might work. A representative of GLAAD said something interesting Technology cannot identify someones sexual orientation. Wait a second. Who says? Maybe this effort isnt up to snuff yet. But saying that technology can never identify someones sexual orientation strikes me as pretty anti sciencey unless were now back to saying sexual orientation is a choice which opens a whole new kettle of fish. Anyway Im not sure what I think about this technology or its ramifications but I have no problem with the notion that science will be able to figure out these things and well probably find out that some things are wired some are a choice and most are a mix of the two. The point is that opponents dont like this science because of the political and social consequences of it. Maybe theres a parallel here with some deniers of climate change. But only those deniers get accused of not believing in science.

In one of South Floridascongressional districts the party machine swept in to prop up a two term incumbent by painting his opponent as a puppet of fossil fuel interests and dirty coal money. The only catch? The incumbent is Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo and the party apparatus is the National Republican Congressional Committee whose coffers this cycle contain nearly 7 million in donations from the oil and gas industry. The ad was released on Oct. 30 and immediatelynational environmental groups that generally align with Democrats called foul underscoring their support of Curbelos Democratic challenger Debbie Mucarsel Powell. If Curbelo had been half the climate champion he claims he is he wouldnt be desperately seeking an ad littered with lies such as this said Sierra Club PAC Director Sarah Burton in a statement. But Curbelo isnt a climate champion hes a consistent vote against clean energy against our public lands and in favor of fossil fuels. Debbie Mucarsel Powell is a climate champion and the advocate South Floridians need as they watch sea levels rise see beaches destroyed by red tide and live with the increasing threat of stronger more powerful hurricanes. Curbelo has received more than 192000 from energy and natural resource firms in comparison tothe less than 5000 thatMucarsel Powellhas received from the same sector of donors according tothe Center for Responsive Politics. A spokesperson forMucarsel Powells campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Curbelo is one of thefounders of the Climate Solutions Caucus a bipartisangroup in Congress ostensibly committedto fighting global warming but restricted in practice by the reliance ofits 45 Republicanmembers on support from oil and gas firms. While he broke ranks this summer to express his support for a carbon tax as a possible way to combat climate change more than 30 of Curbelos Republican colleagues on the caucus supported a symbolic measure that disavowed a carbon tax. Last December he joined caucus members in a budget vote that would have openedup 1.5 million acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drillingMother Jonesreported at the time. The latest forecast from polling aggregatorFiveThirtyEighthas Curbelo trailing by less than one percentage point. The super PAC Climate Hawks Vote which supports candidates with a progressive energy agendahas been running ads against Curbelo that point to his history of receiving donations from fossil fuel companies including Chevron and Exxon Mobil.This cycle hisNo. 1 donorhas been NextEra Energy the Florida electric utility which is one of the largest purveyors of solar and wind energy projects in the country. We sure appreciate the help from the NRCC in calling out politicians who take dirty fossil fuel money and then obstruct progress on climate change and are looking forward to similar NRCC ads attacking every single one of their own candidates said RL Miller Climate Hawks Votes political director in a statement. We only wish the ad had noted how much Carlos Curbelo has taken from Big Oil.	False	False	False	False	False
William Happer the White Houses most veteran climate change denier who tried unsuccessfully to establish an ad hoc panel to challenge near universally accepted climate science is leaving the Trump administration according to reports from EE Newsand Bloomberg. A retired Princeton physics professor with no expertise in climatology Happer has served as President Donald Trumps deputy assistant for emerging technologies on the National Security Council since September 2018. He has long argued that the planet and humans benefit from increased carbon dioxide emissions. He has called climate science a cult claimed Earth is in the midst of a CO2 famine and said the demonization of carbon dioxide isjust like the demonization of the poor Jewsunder Hitler. Earlier this year TrumptappedHapper to lead a panel of fringe researchers tasked specifically with conducting adversarial scientific peer review of climate science part of the administrations relentless effort to discredit and downplay the ongoing crisis. The White House ultimately scrapped the plan as EE News reported in July. News of Happers departure comes one day after the resignation of his boss national security adviser John Bolton. It was Bolton who recruited Happer to the National Security Council and backed his effort to create an anti science panel according to The New York Times. The CO2 Coalition a right wing think tank that Happer co founded and that argues Earth benefits from humans pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere confirmedhis upcoming resignation in a Tuesday post to its website and praised him for his efforts. While your proposed review of alarmist analyses and projections has been delayed we believe your work in calling attention to the problem of unscientific climate alarmism has reduced the chances of the dramatic increases in energy prices that would arise from the banning of fossil fuels that some have proposed Patrick Moore and Caleb Rossiter two representatives of the CO2 Coalition wrote in a joint statement. The CO2 Coalition is one of several think tanks that peddle misinformation about climate change and receive funding from the Mercer familythe billionaire megadonors whogave more than 15 million to Trumps 2016 campaign.

Its true that not all the sea ice is gone yet but much of what remains is thin enough that the light passing through it is allowing algae blooms. In many places it is cracked and subject to being broken up by storms which due to the extremes of heat and cold confronting eachother in that region have extremes of wind and wave. The Jacobshaven Glacier delivering 10 of the ice melt from Greenlands ice caps to the sea no longer flows at a glacial pace but rather is retreating at 10 kmyr with the rate of retreat increasing at an increasing rate just as with the sea ice. Instead of climate changing over millennia we are now seeing it change in ways we can observe with our own eyes in the course of a season. Even as some scientists are still looking at what happened during the second half of the 20th century at a scale of change over decades others are beginning to address the significant acceleration of changes observed year by year. A link to a number of papers since 2015 showing dramatic climate change globally and in particular with extremes at the poles is still controversial to some. Dramatic climate change is affecting both the Arctic and West Antarctica yet the relative roles of local versus remote forcings in causing the changes are being debated. As global climate change continues to unfold the two way links between the tropics and the poles will play key determining factors in the climatic evolution of these sensitive regions. Thus the time is ripe for a detailed look at how the tropics and the poles are coupled climatically. This special collection of the Journal of Climate on Connecting the Tropics to Polar Regions grew out of a mini conference on the same topic that was held at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory in June 2014 ConferenceWeb.html Removal of the sea ice from over the ESAS allows storms to churn up the bottom sediments speeding the release of Methane. Methane releases speed up the melting of the permafrost. The permafrost stores huge amounts of methane and fresh water. We have known this since 2007. A policy briefing from the Woods Hole Research Center concludes that the IPCC doesnt adequately account for a methane warming feedback While most attention has been given to carbon dioxide it isnt the only greenhouse gas that scientists are worried about. Carbon dioxide is the most important human emitted greenhouse gas but methane has also increased in the atmosphere and it adds to our concerns. As the Earth warms and the Arctic warms especially fast the permafrost melts and soil decomposition accelerates. Consequently an initial warming leads to more emission leading to more warming and more emission. It is a vicious cycle and there may be a tipping point where this self reinforcing cycle takes over. Recently a policy briefing from the world leading Woods Hole Research Center has moved our understanding of this risk further through a clearly written summary. The briefing cites two recent papers here and here that study the so called permafrost carbon feedback. One of these studies makes use of projections from the most recent IPCC report to estimate that up to 205 gigatons equivalent of carbon dioxide could be released due to melting permafrost. This would cause up to 0.5C up to 0.9F extra warming. Arctic scientists warn that the release of the methane from the ESAS could happen with the same surprising acceleration we see with glaciers sea ice and the polar ice caps melting and have a huge effect on the melt rate of the permafrost. Just as bad the permafrost melting would continue after 2100 which would lock us into even more warming. Under this scenario meeting a 2C limit would be harder than anticipated. The current IPCC targets do not adequately account for this feedback. This is essentially what arctic scientists have been warning about for a decade now but pointing out that the time scale is no longer centuries but just years and this is another reason why the IPCC is moving up their next report date	False	False	False	False	False
Two Republican House members have signed their name onto bipartisan carbon tax legislation a bill that stands virtually zero chance of passing during the lame duck session. GOP Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Francis Rooney of Florida are to introduce a carbon tax bill on Tuesday alongside Florida Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch.TheEnergy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act if passed would slap a 15 per metric ton carbon fee on fossil fuel industries. While the bill has little chance of passing it is intended to spark a debate over carbon pricing as the Democratic Party prepares to take over the lower chamber of Congress. More than a dozen federal agencies just warned us that if we dont take dramatic action climate change will knock 10 percent off of our GDP by the end of this century Deutch the bills Democratic co sponsorstated to Bloomberg Environment. Putting a price on carbon can help change the behavior of polluters. We hope our bipartisan bill will spur action on climate change before its too late. That 15 per metric ton fee would increase by 10 every year until reaching certain carbon emission targets. In order to shield citizens from higher fossil fuel prices revenue from the tax would be given back out to households.Sponsors of the legislation believe it would slash greenhouse gas emissions by one third over a 10 year period and a 90 percent cut by 2050 compared to 2015 emission levels. TheEnergy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is notable in that itsthe first bipartisan carbon tax bill introduced in Congress in about 10 years. However given the GOP will control the Senate and White House for at least the next two years its passage appears quite bleak. The bill comes not long after an outgoing Republican lawmaker Rep. Carlos Curbelo introduced a carbon tax bill of his own this year. Cureblos bill was more stringent calling for a24 per ton fee on carbon. Much like the new bipartisan bill Curbelos was doomed to fail from the beginning and he endured attack ads from the right for even introducing it. Long considered one of the most at risk Republicans heading into Election Day Curbelo went on to lose his Miami area House seat to a Democratic challenger. Curbelo was one among many moderate Republicans on the Climate Solutions Caucus who lost re election. Altogether 13 GOP members of the bipartisan climate group lost their elections and numerous others chose to retire.

Incoming New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez brings with her a massive online following influence she says shell deploy only in support of candidates and politicians who support her plan for a Green New Deal. The Green New Deal is something Ocasio Cortez invokes frequently in media appearances and rallies. So whats actually in it? Her office recently released the text of a proposed House rules change outlining the plan. The proposed rule change for the upcoming 116th Congress would require the creation of a Select Committee for a Green Deal that would be responsible for creating the plan by January 1 2020 with corresponding draft legislation soon after. The text of the rule change lays out the committees jurisdiction and required areas of action. Its scope and mandate for legislative authority amounts to a radical grant of power to Washington over Americans lives homes businesses travel banking and more. Early on under Jurisdiction the document makes clear its grandiose philosophical vision The select committee shall have authority to develop a detailed national industrial economic mobilization plan for the transition of the United States economy to become greenhouse gas emissions neutral and to significantly draw down greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and oceans and to promote economic and environmental justice and equality. In addition to achieving its goal of meeting 100 of national power demand through renewable sources the document also repeatedly states the Green New Deal will advance non environmental projects such as social economic racial regional and gender based justice. Ocasio Cortezs plan further claims it will virtually eliminate poverty The Plan for a Green New Deal and the draft legislation shall recognize that a national industrial economic mobilization of this scope and scale is a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States and to make prosperity wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation. More specifically Ocasio Cortezs plan calls for within 10 years a series of lofty overhauls of American life emphasis added Between its calls for upgrading homes and overhauling travel public infrastructure and even the way Americans consume electricity the plan leaves virtually no facet of everyday life untouched. Think of how often you dont use electricity to imagine how much of your average day the plan wouldntimpact. The proposed committee would also have seemingly total oversight of American industry with a mandate for pushing union membership. Under Scope of the Plan a section on labor states the committees final plan shall Require strong enforcement of labor workplace safety and wage standards that recognize the rights of workers to organize and unionize free of coercion intimidation and harassment and creation of meaningful quality career employment. Later in the document Ocasio Cortezs plan imagines creating a national jobs force to help people participate in this transition. The Green New Deal it says shall provide all members of our society across all regions and all communities the opportunity training and education to be a full and equal participant in the transition including through a job guarantee program to assure a living wage job to every person who wants one. The plan also imagines creating governmental support for transitioning minority communities. The deal shall ensure a just transition for all workers low income communities communities of color indigenous communities rural and urban communities and the front line communities most affected by climate change pollution and other environmental harm including by ensuring that local implementation of the transition is led from the community level. More Ocasio Cortez sees this plan is being a vehicle through which social equality might finally realized through theuse of reparations to right historicalinjustices. The final Green New Deal willmitigate deeply entrenched racial regional and gender based inequalities in income and wealth including without limitation ensuring that federal and other investment will be equitably distributed to historically impoverished low income deindustrialized or other marginalized communities in such a way that builds wealth and ownership at the community level. And if that werent enough to ensure that Democratic Socialism could be fully realized in America the plan includes failsafe in the form of universal income and Medicarefor All The plan it says shall include additional measures such as basic income programs universal health care programs and any others as the select committee may deem appropriate to promote economic security labor market flexibility and entrepreneurism. Ocasio Cortez clarifies that this plan would not only need to be financed by taxpayers but also the Federal Reserve and other institutions the government can create. The end of the document contains a QA one of which deals with the plans funding The Federal Reserve can extend credit to power these projects and investments new public banks can be created as in WWII to extend credit and a combination of various taxation tools including taxes on carbon and other emissions and progressive wealth taxes can be employed. Ocasio Cortez may not be in Congress yet but she already has a plan to remake the way Americans drive commute live work and even use the financial system. Let there be little doubt how she aspires to wield power in Washington. Editors Note This post has been updated with grammatical fixes.	False	False	False	False	False
Accompanying every hurricane are numerous stories in mainstream media outlets suggesting disaster could have been averted had American elected officials done more to stop global warming which left wing pundits continue to insist is almost entirely being caused by humans carbon dioxide CO2 emissions. In article after article pundits have claimed Republicans especially President Donald Trump are in some way responsible for Hurricane Florence. The Washington Posts editorial board in an article titled Yes you can blame President Trump for Hurricane Florence even went so far as to say Trump was complicit for the storm. This is total nonsense. Not only are there countless good reasons to question the extent to which humans are contributing to global warming theres no evidence indicating hurricanes have become significantly worse as a result of global warming. As Roy Spencer Ph.D. an acclaimed climate scientist who previously worked for NASA recently stated The fact that there has been no long term change in global hurricane activity and even a 50 percent decrease in U.S. landfalling major hurricanes over the last 80 years means no one is complicit in these storms. James Agresti the president of the Just Facts think tank rightly notes data appearing in the academic journal Geophysical Research Letters show the global number and intensity of cyclones hurricanes and major hurricanes have been roughly level for the past four to five decades. Some have said Florence was made worse because of warmer ocean waters caused by climate change but thats also false. Writing for Climate Change Dispatch Michael Bastasch explains An analysis of Florences path by Cato Institute meteorologist Ryan Maue showed ocean temperatures were abnormally cool for most of the storms trek through the Atlantic Ocean. Even the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change one of the most notorious defenders of the theory humans are headed for a climate catastrophe admitted in 2012 there is low confidence in long term changes in tropical cyclone activity after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities. However over the satellite era increases in the frequency and intensity of the strongest storms in the North Atlantic are robust. However the cause of this increase is debated and there is low confidence in attribution of changes in tropical cyclone activity to human influence. And if all that werent enough its absolutely absurd to say Trump is any way responsible for global warming because even if it is true humans are the primary cause of warming carbon dioxide emissions actually dropped in Trumps first two years in office. In 2017 the United States emitted 41.8 million fewer tons of CO2 than in 2016 the largest reduction in the world. And from 2006 to 2016 the United States has averaged an annual reduction in its carbon dioxide emissions of 1.2 percent according to an analysis by BP. The reason the Washington Post and others are consistently alleging despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary that Republicans are somehow to blame for natural disasters such as Hurricane Florence is either because they know absolutely nothing about the topic or because they believe it will help Democrats win elections. Either way you should stick to what the best available science says not the fear mongering of anti conservative zealots.
