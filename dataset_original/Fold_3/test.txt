The Extinction Rebellion protesters arent helping their cause. THIS IS AN EMERGENCY warns the website of the Extinction Rebellion a group of climate change activists whose civil disobedience has included gluing themselves to a train and to Jeremy Corbyns fence nailing a pink boat to the ground in Oxford Circus pouring fake blood outside Downing Street holding a die in at Londons Natural History Museum and camping beneath the citys Marble Arch. What do they want? 1 For Britain to declare a climate and ecological emergency 2 for Britain to commit to net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2025 and 3 for a special climate change citizens assembly to decide future environmental policies. When do they want it? Now. We are now facing an existential crisis the climate crisis and ecological crisis which have never been treated as crises before they have been ignored for decades said Greta Thunberg a Swedish activist addressing London demonstrators. And for way too long the politicians and the people in power have gotten away with not doing anything. Now if Ms. Thunberg who is 16 years old had been addressing Chinese American or Indian protesters I might have had some sympathy. But to suggest that Britain has ignored climate change for decades is simply untrue. Since 1990 the country has achieved a 38 percent decrease in carbon dioxide emissions and has reduced its annual emissions by more than 43 percent this despite considerable economic growth. While the Paris Agreement sets the aim for net zero carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2050 and net zero greenhouse gases by 2070 Parliament in 2008 introduced the Climate Change Act which commits the United Kingdom to reducing its annual emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050. The U.K. has also removed coal as a major electricity source. I am sympathetic to the first of their aims making the environment a political priority and declaring climate change to be a global emergency. Scientists may not be infallible but Ive seen no credible argument for why they are all wrong in the same way. However much like Alexandria Ocasio Cortezs Green New Deal the demands of the Extinction Rebellion are risibly overreaching and counterproductive. In fact their demands could be realized only through an immediate economic overhaul by people who have yet to prove their competence. Recall the five goals set out in the Green New Deal as part of a ten year plan. First to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions while providing quality jobs for all. Second to guarantee millions of good high wage jobs and economic security. Third to invest and update industry and infrastructure. Fourth to secure healthy food and a livable climate for everyone. Fifth to end oppression and bring about the redistribution of power. Recall also the much criticized supporting FAQ materials produced by Ocasio Cortezs office. Embarrassing clauses about farting cows airplanes and those unwilling to work aside this document was illuminating because it showed that those who devised the Green New Deal have in practical terms no clue what they are doing. The same is true of the Extinction Rebellion. The entire spectacle has been highly disruptive for businesses and law enforcement alone. Im extremely concerned about the impact that the protests are having on our ability to tackle issues like violent crime if they continue any longer said Sadiq Khan Londons mayor who has estimated that around 9000 police officers have been dispatched to deal with the protesters. The police have made over 1000 arrests. Perhaps this frustration explains why Adam Boulton a presenter on Sky News told an Extinction Rebellion organizer Robin Boardman on live TV that the protesters come across as incompetent middle class self indulgent people trying to tell us how to live our lives. Instead of explaining why this perception is wrong Boardman insisted with his hand on his heart that he cared deeply before storming off the set. Yes Boulton was aggressive and accusatory but so are the tactics of the Extinction Rebellion.	False	True	False	True	True
The Trump administration has repeatedly pointed to declines in U.S. carbon emissions to justify its fossil fuel focused energy dominance agenda. But a new analysis has delivered a blow to that defense concluding that the nations greenhouse gas emissions rose sharply in 2018. Emissions in the country jumped 3.4 percent last year the second largest annual increase in more than two decades according to a preliminary estimate by the economic research company Rhodium Group. The analysis comes on the heels of two gut wrenching climate reports one by the United Nations and another authored by scientists from more than a dozen federal agencies in the U.S. that warn the world is running out of time to stave off catastrophic and potentially irreversible climate change. The Trump administration continues to dismiss and downplay the crisis. I dont believe it President Donald Trump who has a long history of climate change denial said of his own administrations report. He added that were the cleanest weve ever been. Between 2005 and 2017 CO2 emissions in the U.S. fell by about 14 percent. Administration officials havetouted these declines to explain their push to boost fossil fuels as well as to defend the presidentsdecision last year to withdraw the U.S. from the historic Paris accord on combating climate change. We are moving forward but we are not moving forward in a detrimental impact to our economy as what the Paris climate accord would have called for Wheeler said. We are reducing our CO2 emissions faster than most other developed countries. We have our own plan. Were moving forward. Were addressing the issue. Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke who resigned Jan. 2 under a cloud of ethics scandals told the National Petroleum Council last month that the administrations regulatory philosophy is to partner with the fossil fuel sector which he said was at the leading edge of technology. The U.S. has lead the charge in cutting emissions of CO2 and methane a potent greenhouse gas he added. Everyone else is up he said referring to other countries overall emissions. Were going down while we have our record breaking oil and gas production. But as Rhodium Groups new analysis makes clear that was not the case in 2018. The emissions uptick the largest since the economic bounce back from the recession that ended in mid 2009 comes despite a record number of coal fired power plants going offline replaced largely by the use of natural gas. Along with an 1.9 percent spike in power sector emissions increases occurred in the transportation industry and buildings sectors according to Rhodium. Contributing to the overall increase were the growing U.S. economy a cold start to the year that required additional energy for heating and the limited progress made in developing decarbonization strategies the analysis found. With a new Congress in session we demand they heed these warnings about climate change and step up to act at the scale of the crisis she said in a statement. The administration has aggressively rolled back environmental and climate regulations including President Barack Obamas Clean Power Plan a policy limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. At Interior Zinke overturned an Obama era moratorium on new coal leases on federal land scrapped a hydraulic fracturing rule meant to better protect public health and curtailed a rule limiting the amount of methane that can be released from oil and gas operations on federal and Native American lands. Even amid the current partial government shutdown the administration has prioritized fossil fuels. The Interior Departmentone of the main agencies affected by the shutdown. is still issuing permits for oil companies according to Bloomberg. And the agency is continuing its push to open Alaskas fragile Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling holding public meetings as part of its ongoing environmental review process Alaska Public Media reported.

California legislators have voted to extend a centerpiece program to cut greenhouse gas emissions burnishing the states reputation as a bulwark against Donald Trumps demolition of climate change measures. In a rare show of bipartisan agreement on climate change eight Republicans joined with Democrats in Californias two legislative houses to extend the cap and trade emissions system a further 10 years until 2030. The emissions lowering scheme the second largest of its kind in the world aims to help the state reach its target of cutting planet warming gases 40 by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. Tonight California stood tall and once again boldly confronted the existential threat of our time said Jerry Brown Californias governor. Republicans and Democrats set aside their differences came together and took courageous action. Thats what good government looks like. The cap and trade program established in 2006 under then governor Arnold Schwarzenegger sets a limit on emissions and requires polluters to either reduce their output or purchase permits from those who have. As the limit steadily becomes stricter it nudges businesses to take the more financially attractive option of cutting their pollution. California the sixth largest economy in the world is in stark opposition to Trumps administration. The president has said he will withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement and has set about dismantling federal policies that lower emissions. Brown has positioned himself as a countervailing force to Trump visiting China to talk to its leaders about climate change and promising to build and launch weather monitoring satellites should federal budget cuts endanger programs handled by Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOOA. A lot of you people are going to be alive and youre going to be alive in a horrible situation Brown told Californian lawmakers at a committee hearing shortly before the vote. This isnt for me Im going to be dead. This is for you and its real. Many Californian Republicans remain opposed to the cap and trade system warning it will pose a crushing blow to small businesses. But the bill ended up gaining an unusual level of Republican support with the extension also supported by key conservative constituencies including the California Chamber of Commerce and associations representing manufacturers and agriculture interests. Concessions to get some Republican support such as the limiting of separate regulations on refineries risked alienating more liberal Democrats. Some environmental groups including the Sierra Club attacked the bill for allowing polluters to continue emitting greenhouse gases if they offset them with green projects including those outside California. But other climate activists declared themselves pleased with the outcome pointing out that it showed that action to reduce emissions is bipartisan and popular. California is once again showing Washington DC and the rest of the world that fighting climate and air pollution is the right thing for our health economy and future said Fred Krupp president of the Environmental Defense Fund. Californias pioneering attitude to climate change action was underlined by separate court action launched on Monday aimed at holding fossil fuel companies accountable for global warming. Marin and San Mateo counties along with the City of Imperial Beach filed a lawsuit in the California superior court to complain that 37 oil gas and coal companies knew burning their products would increase carbon pollution and cause sea levels rise. Defendants have known for nearly 50 years that greenhouse gas pollution from their fossil fuel products has a significant impact on the Earths climate and sea levels the complaint states. The municipalities are claiming damages from the fossil fuel firms echoing a strategy used against the tobacco industry in the 1990s that resulted in multibillion dollar payouts. The companies targeted in the lawsuit include Shell Exxon Mobile Chevron and BP. According to the municipalities these businesses have caused around 20 of all industrial carbon dioxide and methane pollution since the 1960s.	True	False	False	False	True
President Donald Trump set in motion a vast rollback of energy climate and environmental regulations during his first two years in office. Over the next two years those actions will face intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill. On Thursday Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives and the committees that conduct government oversight. Within the first few months of the year incoming committee chairs intend to hold a series of hearings to pick apart Trump's energy and environmental policies and what role industry insiders played in crafting them. The Trump administration has targeted dozens of rules. Some of the biggest items on its agenda include withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement expanding drilling on federal lands and watering down rules ranging from limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants to fuel efficiency in cars and trucks. Rep. Raul Grijalva the Arizona Democrat tipped to chair the House Natural Resources Committee says Americans can expect the committee to probe the financial costs and public health risks associated with Interior Department policies under Trump. Those include rolling back methane emissions rules from oil and gas operations and making virtually all federally administered offshore waters available to drillers. The Trump administration has spent two years giving away the store to fossil fuel companies and Republicans in Congress cheered every step of the way says Grijalva. We need to know what kind of impact this corporate favoritism is having on average Americans' health and quality of life.	True	True	False	True	True
The 2015 Paris agreement's ambitious goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C remains within reach a study suggests. The study is one of several to address the carbon budget which among other things determines how much CO2 the planet can emit and still reach a given limit for global warming. It indicates the 2015 target perceived by some as tough could be met with very stringent emissions cuts. It used computer models that project climate behaviour into the future. The aim of the Paris deal was holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2C above pre industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5C. But scientists admit they were taken by surprise by the ambition of the 1.5C figure. The results of the work with computer models have been published in Nature Geoscience. This type of work necessarily contains uncertainties regarding the way the Earth's climate will respond in future and how quickly societies can move away from fossil fuel use. But the study authors say Pursuing 'efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C' is not chasing a geophysical impossibility. Co author Michael Grubb from University College London said This paper shows that the Paris goals are within reach but clarifies what the commitment to 'pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C' really implies. Those commitments would require strengthening the nationally determined contributions NDCs the pledges to cut emissions contained in the Paris agreement. Previous estimates of the remaining 1.5C carbon budget based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's IPCC Fifth Assessment of the climate were around four times lower. But unlike those figures which relied on one line of evidence the new study uses multiple approaches to examine the question and comes up with a rather different result. Co author Prof Pierre Friedlingstein from the University of Exeter said This is very good news for the achievability of the Paris targets. Prof Myles Allen another author from the University of Oxford told BBC News In the main body of the IPCC assessment what it would take to meet a 1.5C goal wasn't assessed in any detail. To be honest it wasn't thought to be the policy priority at the time. Perhaps it should have been but that was the view of the academic community then. But the ambition of Paris caught a lot of people by surprise. The climate models are exaggerating. The predictions are too alarmist. The Tuvaluans and other islanders are safer than we thought. These are among the conclusions that some might reach from this latest work. In reality nothing is quite that straightforward. The models are simulated approximations of possible futures. Inevitably they are going to be at least slightly adrift of reality either in the amount of warming or its timing. They come with caveats and margins of error. In many ways it's remarkable that these computer constructs are even roughly on track. And models designed to come up with very broad potential outcomes for the end of the century may not be fine tuned enough to give more detailed forecasts year by year. The authors themselves are anxious that their research is not misunderstood. The need for urgent action to reduce emissions is unchanged they say. It's just that the most ambitious of the Paris Agreement targets is not as unachievable as many once thought that there is time to act though the task remains a monumental one. Myles Allen added For a two in three chance of keeping temperatures within 1.5C we'd have to reduce emissions in a straight line to zero from where we are now over the next 40 years. It's possible but extremely challenging. So if people are saying can we now relax? That's not the right message to take at all. Scientists agree urgent action will be needed to tackle the effects of rapid temperature increase over the next century. But a study earlier this year suggested the allowable carbon budget had probably been overestimated. It said the pre industrial baseline used to benchmark present day warming was probably older than the IPCC had assumed. Therefore the degree of warming since that baseline was probably greater than had been believed. On Twitter one of the authors of that report Prof Michael Mann said the latest research in Nature Geoscience doesn't account for the pre industrial baseline issue we examined. He added There is some debate about the precise amount of committed warming if we cease emitting carbon immediately. We're probably very close to 1.5C. Meanwhile another study in Nature Geoscience by Gunnar Myhre from the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo and colleagues suggests the greenhouse effect caused by human induced CO2 emissions is now half way to doubling compared with pre industrial conditions. Although the concentrations themselves have not yet reached the halfway mark this is being described as an iconic watermark.	False	True	False	True	True
As thousands of activists and scientists around the world gather to March for Science Bill Nye has a U.S. Constitution lesson for Donald Trump that proves he must advance scientific causes. In an interview on MSNBCs AM Joy Nye said that it explicitly states in the Constitution that the U.S. government must promote the progress of science and useful arts something the Trump administration isnt even close to upholding. Nye had a reminder for the Trump administration I just want to remind the administration that science is political. It is inherently political like everything else Its in the U.S. Constitution Article 1 Section 8 to promote the progress of science and useful arts. And my interpretationof the expression useful arts is engineering. In those days it would be architecture city planning designing of the drainage systems sewage systems and communications systems. This is all in the U.S. Constitution Thats what enables innovation and if our country stops innovating it will not be able to compete worldwide. Nye said that solutions to battling climate change are realistic and doable if the United States simply puts resources toward the effort and decides to act. We could get to 80 percent renewables in the next 15 years we could 100 percent renewable in the next 30 years and we wouldnt have to have a military on the other side of the world protecting oil fields so that we could get our fossil fuels here in North America he said. Once again the biggest hurdle in battling climate change isnt the existence of feasible solutions those already exist. The problem at least in the United States is Republicans in Congress and now the White House especially Trump who believes climates change is a hoax who continue to deny that the climate crisis is happening in the first place despite the overwhelming evidence. Donald Trump isnt just shirking his constitutional responsibility to advance scientific innovation but hesputting at risk the only planet we have.	True	True	False	True	False
First it was global warming andor global cooling. Then when they figured out that they couldnt accurately predict which way it was going to go they settled on climate change. Apparently that phrase just doesnt have the oomph it once did and the church of climate change wants to rebrand their apocalypse to make people far more scared and subsequently obedient. An article by Aaron Hall in AdAge asked the question of whether or not people will be more apt to fall in line with the climate alarmists if they take out the neutral sounding climate change and replace it with something you might hear Chicken Little screaming Scientific terms often fail to resonate in meaningful ways. In the early 1900s for example no one had heard of the hypothesis of the primeval atom. That changed in the 1940s when the term Big Bang was coined which was a simpler more relatable concept for the masses. This complex scientific concept is extremely well known today because a better more tangible term was applied to it. Can we use lessons from the naming of the Big Bang to rebrand climate change? Interestingly Hall notes that politicians liked global warming because it sounded dynamic and scary but since it was too easy to poke holes in they decided to move on to climate change. People began joking about wanting global warming whenever it got too cold outside and the politicians much like the devil himself cant stand it when people laugh at them. Hall being a professional namer wondered allowed about whether or not people would take the church of climate change more seriously if he renamed it to sound scarier. He said that the new name needs to appeal to people who are unscientific to help them understand the severity of the problem and inspire them to make more eco friendly life choices and pro climate choices at the ballot box. In other words it needs to scare people into voting Democrat. What did his team of global namers come up with? A bunch of names that sound like bad B Movie titles. These options are subtle brand shifts from global warming yet they deliver a more negative image. The names signal that ice caps are melting but also create a more visceral image in the mind that real feeling of melting when its too hot outside. A meltdown is a disastrous event that draws from the ultimate terror of a nuclear meltdown an apt metaphor for global destruction. In naming we call metaphorical names suggestive names and they are one of the most popular types of names. Good brand names instill a clear message or even a direct call to action. Perhaps thats why climate change isnt powerful enough Change sounds so neutral. However theres nothing neutral about collapse or chaos. Both are states of events that you absolutely want to avoid. They ask each of us to do what it takes to avoid collapsing or descending into chaos. They both also use alliteration using the same letter or sound at the beginning of connected words a naming trick proven to enhance memorability. Arresting brand names often capitalize on vivid visual associations. They refer to a tipping point that were catapulting toward and must find a way to avert. Because a boiling point is the point at which liquid vaporizes it brings forth imagery of rivers lakes and oceans boiling and disappearing. Melting Point paints a clear picture of solid matter melting. As glaciers melt and disappear so does our way of life. Its time to take the gloves off and stop pretending. Sometimes a brand name needs to be hyperbolic to truly capture hearts and minds. If we dont take massive action now Earth will be uninhabitable an irreversible barren wasteland. Plants and animals will die. Humans wont be able to survive extreme weather like floods droughts and fires. If we dont change we wont even be able to spend time outside. Scorched Earth paints the direst picture of whats to come and what we must avoid and is likely the edgiest brand name from our exploration. Those were just the winners. Hall gives an honorable mention to these as well Emission Critical Focuses on the action we need to take reducing emissions. Pre Extinction Powerful and suggests another mass extinction is imminent if we do not change our ways today. The Great Collapse The collapse of ecosystems economies and our way of life. Earthshattering Creatively arresting the complete destruction of the Earth as we know it. Whats the takeaway from all this? Not that climate change is going to end the world. Its not. No real scientific data points to that fact. The takeaway here is that there are actually people out there trying to worry you into obedience and support for a leftist agenda and in order to do that theyre willing to play with your brain by changing up the words they use. As you see above Hall even admits that theyre willing to get hyperbolic in order to make you scared.	False	False	False	True	True
Most of the threats from climate change are 50 to 75 years out Wheeler asserted adding that the world should be focused on the people who are dying today the thousand children that die every day from lack of drinking water. Lets put aside the fact that climate change is not some distant challenge but one already wreaking havoc on communities around the globe and that Wheeler has proposed gutting existing regulations that protect drinking water. Its absurd to act like planetary warming isnt a significant threat to the worlds freshwater resources. Its the biggest threat of all. Climate change is a multiplier. Very few of the problems that we have right now related to water are going to be made better by climate change. Thats not going to happen. Theres no denying the magnitude of the water crisis in the U.S. and abroad. Droughts which are made worse by climate change lead towater shortages while inland and coastal flooding can contaminate drinking water supplies. Under the current climate change scenario nearly half the global population will be living in areas of high water stress by 2030 according to the United Nations which warns that water is the primary medium through which we will feel the effects of climate change. Last years Fourth National Climate Assessment the work of hundreds of scientists at more than a dozen federal agencies including the EPA documents significant changes in water quality and quantity across the country and warns that water security in the United States is increasingly in jeopardy. The report details how rising temperatures and variable precipitation can have cascading effects on water quality increasing the risk of drought pollutant runoff and harmful algal blooms. Climate change is a multiplier Caldas said. Very few of the problems that we have right now related to water are going to be made better by climate change. Thats not going to happen. Its unsurprising that Wheeler is calling for a massive mobilization to tackle water woes without acknowledging the climate change link considering the administrations relentless push to boost domestic fossil fuel production. It is also reminiscent of former Interior Department chief Ryan Zinkes response to wildfires in the western United States. And in an interview with Fox Business after returning to Washington D.C. Zinke said whether climate change is contributing to the infernos is irrelevant to whats occurred. He emphasized the need for better forest management by pointing to themore than 120 million dead trees in California but failed to mention that the trees died because of a multi year drought that scientists have concluded was made worse by anthropogenic climate change. When a reporter later pressed him outside the White House Zinke said that of course climate change is a factor in the California fires a rather unconvincing acknowledgment considering previous remarks and the number of times Zinke cast doubt on the all but irrefutable body of scientific research that shows human carbon emissions are driving global climate change. Early in his tenure former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt prioritized fixing Superfund the struggling and financially strapped program responsible for cleaning up the nations most contaminated sites. The administration then turned around and proposed slashing funding for the program from 1.09 billion to 762 million. Pruitt said that it wasnt a lack of money that was plaguing the program but rather poor leadership and poor focus on the part of the Obama administration. Superfunds problems have almost everything to do with resources which have all but dried up over the last two decades. Superfund experts havesaid the administrations approach highlights its lack of understanding about how the program functions. EPA maintains that Superfund is a top priority and that it is making great strides in accelerating sites through remediation and back to productive use. Yet the 4.75 trillion 2020 budget blueprint the administration released this month once again calls for cutting Superfund dollars this time by 10 percent.	True	True	True	True	False
CNN The new government report on climate change which the Trump administration released quietly a day after Thanksgiving and two days after President Donald Trump tweeted skeptically about the existence of climate change warns that the drastic human effects on the climate could cause thousands of Americans to die and cost the US economy hundreds of billions of dollars. But even before the report was made public Americans were extremely worried about climate change. Almost two thirds 64 of voters said the US needs to be doing more to address climate change according to a poll by Quinnipiac University in August up from 57 who said the same in December 2015 This opinion is divided by party lines 91 of Democrats said more should be done and 67 of independents agreed. Fewer Republicans one third said more should be done about climate change and another third of Republicans thought that the US is doing enough to address climate change. In the December 2015 Quinnipiac poll 83 of Democrats thought the US should be doing more compared to 62 of independents and 26 of Republicans. The Trump administration chose to speed up release of the new report which is required by law putting it out on Black Friday instead of in December. It also came two days after Trump issued another tweet transmitting his skepticism of the existence of Climate change. Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS Whatever happened to Global Warming? he said Wednesday on Twitter. An earlier portion of the climate change report was released in November 2017 and found no convincing alternative explanation for the changing climate other than human activities especially emissions of greenhouse gases. Trump has stood by his years old claim that climate change is a hoax and emphasized that belief with his statements about the California wildfires which he said were a result of poor forest management drawing criticism from firefighters climate scientists and many others. The government report which is called the National Climate Assessment addressed wildfires reporting that one impact of climate change will be longer and more destructive wildfires that could burn up to six times more forest annually by 2050 in parts of the US. California's wildfires are the worst in the state's history. Over half 53 of voters in the August Quinnipiac poll said climate change is a factor in making fires more extreme. At that point the fires in California were only beginning and some are still burning in November so it's unclear whether that number has changed since August. Eight in 10 Democrats 54 of independents and 22 of Republicans thought in August that climate change has an impact the fires. Another impact of climate change will be on the health of Americans whether because of extreme heat and higher temperatures diseases like Zika that come from mosquitoes and ticks more food and waterborne diseases or higher risk of asthma and allergies. Concern about climate change and global warming has gone up in the last few years from 33 who said they worry a great deal about it in March 2013 to 43 who say the same now according to Gallup Around the same number 45 said they think global warming will pose a serious threat to them or their way of life in their lifetimes in the March poll. That's up from 2010 when Gallup first asked it and only a third of Americans thought global warming would impact them. Democrats are much more likely to think they'll be impacted 67 than independents 45 or Republicans 18 but whether that's because more Democrats live in coastal regions or due to just plain partisanship it's hard to tell. In a statement by White House deputy press secretary Lindsey Walters the Trump administration downplayed the report saying it is largely based on the most extreme scenario which contradicts long established trends by assuming that despite strong economic growth that would increase greenhouse gas emissions there would be limited technology and innovation and a rapidly expanding population.

The panel will consist of scientists who do not accept the overwhelming scientific evidence that rising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are behind climate change and its impacts. The petition is being circulated for signature by Myron Ebell movement greatest threat freedom says trump adviser myron ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute a lobby group for free market fanatics which has become infamous for championing climate change denial It does not disclose its sources of funding but is known to have received money from ExxonMobil and conservative billionaires trump global climate change denial environment such as the Koch brothers.

The creation of the new panel of climate change deniers and the recruitment of supporters to provide it with a veneer of legitimacy echoes the campaign by Joseph Stalins regime to discredit the work of geneticists who disagreed with the disastrous lysenko soviet union russia548786 pseudo scientific theories of Trofim Lysenko. Lysenko wrongly believed that acquired traits could be passed on by parents to their offspring. Stalin embraced lysenkoism as the basis for Soviet agricultural policy while also denouncing and persecuting Lysenkos scientific critics. The Trump administrations climate lysenkoism is being led by William Happer a retired professor from Princeton University who was hired by the National Security Council house role physicist happer 64 takes position senior science technology adviser in September 2018 as deputy assistant to the president and senior director for emerging technologies. Media reports suggest that Professor Happer and his fellow propagandists will target the Fourth National Climate Assessment which was prepared by leading researchers in the United States and concluded last November The impacts of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country. Although the report was subjected to rigorous review by Americas top experts at the National Academy of Sciences it was rejected by President Trump who told journalists I dont believe it. dire economic forecast climate change dont believe2118152002 Professor Happer who has not published any research on climate change in a reputable science journal has been celebrated for many years by climate change contrarians and deniers around the world. He was formerly a trustee of the George C Marshall Institute which received funding from ExxonMobil and other companies to spread doubt inside and outside the United States about the role of fossil fuels in climate change. It disappeared in 2015 and was replaced by the CO2 Coalition which was co founded by Professor Happer. The website for the Coalition asked questions 0283fe86 6ba7 makes many inaccurate and misleading assertions such as Readily available data from both governmental and non governmental sources confirms that extreme weather events in recent years have not happened more often or with greater intensity. In fact the Fifth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published in 2013 concluded Changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed since about 1950. A recent leak of the Coalitons tax filing showed that its largest donors are conservative groups such as the Mercer Family Foundation and the Sarah Scaife Foundation which have a long track record of funding climate change denial. Professor Happer has also collaborated with climate change deniers in other countries such as the United Kingdom. In 2010 he joined the Academic Advisory Committee of the Global Warming Policy Foundation which was set up by Lord Lawson to campaign against polices to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the consumption of fossil fuels. He stepped down from the committee when he was hired by the White House. The foundation published a pamphlet by Professor Happer reportshapper thetruthaboutgreenhousegases.pdf in August 2011 which disputed the scientific evidence that greenhouse gases are causing climate change. In July 2014 Professor Happer caused controversy during an interview on CNBC television climate expert demonization of carbon dio200107 in the United States when he claimed that the demonisation of carbon dioxide is just like the demonisation of the poor Jews under Hitler. Carbon dioxide is actually a benefit to the world and so were the Jews. He was also forced to defend himself after Greenpeace revealed an exchange of email messages Email Chain Happer O Keefe and Donors Trust.html during which Professor Happer discussed writing reports to promote climate change denial in exchange for a secret fee paid to the CO2 Coalition. Americans should not be conned by the Trump administrations climate lysenkoism and should instead place their trust in the robust findings of climate researchers climate09.pdf who place the public interest ahead of political ideology.

SACRAMENTO Calif. Commissions that oversee coastal lands and water pushed the Trump administration to leave California out of plans to expand offshore drilling saying the state will throw up any barriers possible to prevent pumping and transportation of oil. The warning came weeks after Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said he wants to open nearly all U.S. coastlines to offshore oil and gas drilling. Since then the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has proposed six sales of drilling rights off the California coast and a seventh off Oregon and Washington between 2020 and 2023. Given how unpopular oil development in coastal waters is in California it is certain that the state would not approve new pipelines or allow the use of existing pipelines to transport oil from new leases onshore the State Lands Commission wrote in a letter Wednesday to federal officials. The commission controls up to 3 miles offshore at which point federal jurisdiction kicks in. It has not allowed drilling in the state controlled waters since a 1969 oil spill near Santa Barbara. State and local governments could also block the construction of helipads and other infrastructure on land needed to support offshore operations. In the 1980s many coastal cities passed ordinances to block such infrastructure when President Ronald Reagan looked to expand offshore drilling. Many of those laws remain in place. Drillers could find ways around state and local restrictions such as pumping oil directly onto ships for transport but the process is expensive and may not be profitable if oil prices remain relatively low. A separate letter from the California Coastal Commission warned that an oil spill would devastate the states tourism economy and coastal beauty. The letter pointed to the Santa Barbara spill which caused severe environmental damage hurt the fishing industry and dissuaded tourists from visiting. The commission has authority to review activities in federally controlled waters. It cant block drilling but could file a lawsuit contending the move doesnt meet ocean management plans approved jointly by the state and federal governments in the 1970s. Weve fought similar efforts before and we will fight them again Coastal Commission Chair Dayna Bochco said. The state agencies weighed in ahead of a public meeting Thursday in Sacramento the only opportunity for people to register their opinions in person to the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. Fishermen environmentalists surfers and other critics demonstrated outside the state Capitol before marching to the meeting at a nearby library. Several demonstrators chanted in opposition at the open house style meeting where bureau scientists talked one on one with visitors and collected written comments. Why do we want to let someone start drilling for more oil when we need to be putting money into resources for green economy and green fuel said Jim Wilson a 71 year old retired mail carrier from Placerville outside Sacramento. Earlier in the day the California Assembly voted overwhelmingly to oppose renewed drilling. We are California and we will fight back to protect our beautiful coast said Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi of Torrance. Republicans Randy Voepel of Santee and Travis Allen of Huntington Beach said California can safely harvest oil and gas. Allen a GOP candidate for governor said that could help lower gasoline prices. Most of Californias outer continental shelf the area that would be opened to drilling is in shallow water where operations are not complicated said Tim Charters senior director of government and political affairs for the National Ocean Industries Association a trade group for the offshore energy industry. Its critical to keep the dollars at home create the jobs locally instead of sending the money overseas and creating jobs in foreign places he said. Zinke angered critics when he said drilling off Floridas coast would remain off limits prompting California Gov. Jerry Brown and others to request a similar exemption. Regulators later said no final decision had been made about Florida. On Tuesday more than 100 demonstrators gathered outside Oregons state Capitol in Salem to denounce the proposal. A day later in New Jersey more than a dozen groups held a rally in the driving rain on the Asbury Park boardwalk to demonstrate their opposition. Twenty three meetings are planned nationwide in coastal states. Comments can be submitted online through March 9.	True	True	False	True	True
Democrats and conservatives alike say they can help President Donald Trump cut corporate taxes and put money in the pockets of American taxpayers but it will come at a price penalizing coal miners and fossil fuel interests for contributing to global warming. A pair of Democratic senators and the bipartisan Climate Leadership Council aim to make a fee on carbon emissions part of tax reform. Their plans would essentially transfer money from greenhouse gas polluters to individual and corporate taxpayers. The goal of a carbon tax is to reduce the use of goods and services that produce greenhouse gas emissions and to convince companies to reduce their emissions. That would be a hard pill for Trump to swallow given his pledge to revive the coal industry and put miners back to work.	True	True	False	True	True
In an interview with Breitbart News last month the former Montana congressman and Navy SEAL dismissed reports that his days in the Trump administration were numbered as nothing more than rumors. But the intense scrutiny Zinke was certain to face next year from House Democrats wielding new oversight authority turned out to be a fight that he or perhaps the boss hes been so loyal to wasnt up for. President Donald Trump announced early Saturday that Zinke will resign at the end of the year. Zinkes final day as agency chief will be Jan. 2 The Associated Press reported Saturday citing his resignation letter. Thats one day before Democrats take control of the House of Representatives. In recent weeks some Democratic lawmakers made clear that they intended to investigate both Zinkes personal conduct and policy decisions. He has faced nearly 20 federal investigations one of which has been referred to the Justice Department for possible criminal violations. Rep. Gerry Connolly D Va. the vice ranking member of the House oversight committee told HuffPost last month that Zinke is definitely going to be a subject of great interest following a complete desert of oversight under the Republican watch. Since Trump took office Republicans on the House oversight committee have denied more than 60 subpoena requests from Democratic members including one related to Zinkes reassignment of career employees. And Rep. Raul Grijalva D Ariz. one of Zinkes fiercest critics in Washington and the incoming chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee told Outside Magazineand other outlets he was prepared to subpoena Zinke if necessary to obtain information. In his resignation letter to Trump Zinke wrote that vicious and politically motivated attacks against him had created an unfortunate distraction according to the AP. And in a statement posted to Twitter the ongoing agency chief said he cannot justify spending thousands of dollars defending myself and my family against false allegations. While it appears on the surface that Zinkes departure was a personal decision the AP and The New York Times reported Saturday that the White House forced him out over concerns about ongoing scandals mounting scrutiny and negative press. This is no kind of victory but Im hopeful that it is a genuine turning of the page Grijalva said in a statement. The next secretary should respect public desire for strong environmental standards and an end to corporate favoritism. There had been numerous signs that Zinke was possibly on his way out. Last month Trump told reporters that Zinke is doing an excellent job but that he would take a look at the allegations against him and soon make a decision about his future. Zinkes personal attack last month against the congressman soon to wield oversight power over him only added to the speculation. In recent interviews and public appearances Zinke seemed to be working to maintain his boss approval. He told Bloomberg that Trump is great to work for despite occasional calls at 2 a.m. and that if you do your job he supports you. And Zinke repeatedly touted the administrations effort to boost domestic fossil fuel production while continuing to ignore the scientific communitys dire warnings that we are running out of time to rein in greenhouse gas emissions and stave off catastrophic climate change. Im proud of the fact that were the No. 1 oil and gas producer in the world he said at a Dec. 11 briefing to announce a proposed rollback of Obama era clean water rules. Im proud of the fact that were going to get even better. Because when America prospers the world is safer. Stepping down now may spare Zinke some embarrassment but it will not reduce the need for oversight of the Administrations poor stewardship at Interior Rep. Don Beyer D Va. said in a statement. For all his feigned swagger Ryan Zinke lacked the courage or integrity to face accountability skipping town as soon as he faced scrutiny Evers said. Unfortunately for the American people Zinke leaves behind a deputy secretary with similar ethical concerns. It is high time for the glare of sunlight to focus on Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt. Well see if he has the spine to answer questions that Zinke lacked.	True	True	False	False	False
G7 energy ministers have failed to agree a statement on climate change this afternoonbecause of 'US reservations' it has emerged. Top officials from the Group of Seven industrial nations gathered in Rome Italy today amid growing concerns over the US administration's moves to unravel policies aimed at stalling global warming. Environmental activists fear US President Donald Trumpis dismantling Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan which aimed at reducing carbon pollution from power plants. Greenpeace was holding a sit in outside Monday's meeting calling on officials to maintain their commitments to reduce greenhouse gases under the 2015 Paris Agreement. However the US 'reserved its position' on the text about commitments made by G7 countries under the Paris accord said Carlo Calenda the Italian minister for economic development who chaired the meeting in Rome. The ministers' agenda had called for discussion of energy security policies to move away from coal natural gas routes and supply sustainable development of electricity sources alternative fuel scenarios and energy access and investments in Africa. Lacking unanimity Italy which currently presides the Group of Seven decided against proposing the joint statement Calenda said. The Paris Agreement endorsed by members of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC is a bedrock of international action against man made global warming. It vows to cap warming to 'well below' two degrees Celsius 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit compared to late 19th century levels an effort that scientists say will require massive cuts in carbon emissions from coal and other fossil fuels. It also pledges to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in aid for poor countries badly exposed to drought flood rising seas and other climate impacts. In March President Donald Trump signed an executive order rolling back some of the previous Democratic administration's policies on carbon emissions and climate change. Experts have said his plan which eases emissions limits for coal fired power plants and scraps more stringent vehicle pollution standards almost guarantees that the US will fail to meet its commitments under the Paris Agreement. Trump has also said he does not intend to honour promises made by the administration of his predecessor Barack Obama to provide financial aid under the Paris accord. However Trump's team is also deeply divided on whether to withdraw from the pact according to US media reports. On March 30 the White House said a decision on whether to withdraw would be made ahead of the G7 summit in Italy in late May. Under Obama the United States the second biggest carbon polluter provided critical impetus for the Paris deal by concluding a precursor deal with China the number one emitter. The Group of Seven gathering the biggest western democracies comprises Britain Canada France Germany Italy Japan and the United States.	True	False	False	True	False
After months of waging a public and at times bloody battle with protesters bivouacked outside its construction site in North Dakota law enforcement officers razed the encampment and arrested the holdouts. Meanwhile roughly 1700 miles east the company completed the final edits requested by regulators to its application to start building the Rover natural gas pipeline a 4.2 billion project through Ohio. That project had sailed through the permitting process and these markups would be its last. Project manager Buffy Thomason wanted to extend thanks to the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency so she emailed the firms lobbyist in the state Art Arnold that evening. Arnold forwarded the message to Laura Factor the agencys assistant director less than an hour later. In the same email Arnold called the OEPA staff among if not the most honest and helpful people Ive encountered. OEPA Director Craig Butler described Arnold and Factor as good friends in a separate exchange with an agency colleague. Theyve done their jobs without beating us up in the process Arnold added. Theyve offered options when we were stuck. Theyve pointed us in the right direction so we could build the pipeline and stay within their good graces. But just a few months after those emails were sent Energy Transfer Partners and the state officials became embroiled in a vicious public fight over a massive drilling fluid spill and construction pollution. The company has flagrantly challenged the OEPAs authority infuriating the agency and eliciting a rare public investigation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or FERC the federal agency that regulates interstate electricity and natural gas operations. The dispute offers a cautionary tale in what one critic described as regulatory capture of a state agency by a company with deep ties to the Trump administration and a reputation as an environmental pariah unafraid to deploy scorched earth tactics against its opponents. The moves by Energy Transfer Partners further fuel fears of whats to come amid proposed steep cuts to the EPAs budget and a brazen campaign by U.S. Administrator Scott Pruitt to cozy up to fossil fuel interests. Energy Transfer Partners problems in Ohio began shortly after construction began on Rover in March. Heavy rains poured as workers built a stretch of the pipeline over flat farmlands and workers began dumping excess sediment laden water onto fields and into streams according to citations from the OEPA. Then in April the company accidentally leaked onto Ohio wetlands more than 2 million gallons of fluid used to lubricate the machines that bore pathways for underground pipes through a process known as horizontal directional drilling. The spill suffocated anything that lived in an area the size of nearly nine football fields under a foot or more of a slurry of nontoxic bentonite clay and water the agency said. On May 5 the OEPA ordered the company to submit a plan to address future spills restore the wetlands and apply for stormwater permitting. It also fined the firm 431000. In a sharp break from the charm it applied during the application process Energy Transfer Partners rejected the agencys demands insisting that because the pipeline crossed state boundaries the OEPA lacked the authority to make those orders. This kind of pushback were getting from Rover that says You have absolutely no state authority this is all a FERC issue and the tenor and tone theyve taken to interact with us doesnt happen often Butler said. This very negative response that weve gotten from Rover up until now and very recently is pretty uncharacteristic. On May 10 FERC stepped in to back up the state EPA halting construction at eight sites where Energy Transfer Partners had yet to begin boring the pipe. FERCs order has given environmental groups like the Sierra Club temporary reprieve from their own legal effort to block a pipeline they see as fueling climate change and endangering the environment in the state one of the proposed construction sites includes the Captina Creek the only cold water stream in Ohio with the right conditions for the endangered hellbender salamander to breed. But FERC allowed Energy Transfer Partners to continue work at the 22 other locations including the site of the largest spill. The company sent teams to vacuum up the drilling sludge from the wetlands and deposit it in two nearby quarries. Things took another turn on May 26 when the OEPA discovered traces of diesel in the samples collected from the spill site. Using diesel in the drilling fluids violated the permit FERC had granted forcing regulators to reclassify the site as an industrial accident. On June 1 FERC opened an investigation into the incident. On July 7 the OEPA once again sent a letter listing demands to Energy Transfer Partners. The letter reiterated orders made about two months earlier to apply for stormwater permits pay mounting fines nearing 1 million and submit a plan to restore the wetlands. The agency also directed the company to excavate the diesel contaminated slurry from the quarries dispose of it at solid waste landfills and install groundwater monitoring around the area to ensure that private wells werent affected. The company agreed only after FERC backed up the OEPA on the demands five days later. The OEPA said it will review Energy Transfer Partners submissions by next week to determine if its plans are in compliance. The OEPA said it remains committed to supporting oil and gas development in the state. StillButler the agencys director said Energy Transfer Partners received no preferential treatment during the application process despite what seemed like an amicable relationship at the start of the construction process. At the highest level this does not diminish our overall posture in terms of trying to support oil and gas development in the state including the development of pipeline networks he said. Weve got several of these large pipelines. Our only concern is while were supporting they at least have to follow the rules.	False	False	False	True	True
Environmentalists lamenting that a green wave didnt wash over Congress can find a glimmer of hope in the results of several key governor races. As of Wednesday it looks like Democrats committed to fighting climate change gained several key governorships that could accelerate local and national progress in clean energy. Democrat Stephen Sisolak won in Nevada Democrat Janet Mills won in Maine and Democrat Michelle Lujan Grisham won in New Mexico. In the past two years these states all passed renewable energy bills through their legislatures that were vetoed by Republican governors. But with these Democrats now heading into the governors mansions its very likely that these states will take another run at clean energy legislation. Sisolak for example campaigned on his support Question 6 one of the few state clean energy ballot initiatives that passed on Tuesday. This is a ballot measure that commits Nevada to getting 50 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. In fact as governor I would like to get us on the road to 100 percent Sisolak said in a campaign ad. Meanwhile Millss platform included cutting Maines greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2030. And Grisham advocated new rules to regulate methane a potent greenhouse gas and has a long voting record in the House as a representative of New Mexico in favor of bills to address climate change. Democrats flipped executive offices in other states as well. Democrat Tony Evers Wisconsins governor elect defeated incumbent Scott Walker on a platform that included a pledge to join 17 other governors committed to the goals of the Paris climate agreement. These wins are critical because governors have executive authority that allows them to dictate some state energy priorities. They also play a huge role in how federal environmental laws like the Clean Air Act are enforced. We saw this play out in North Carolina after the last election. The state passed a law in 2012 preventing the government from even considering the latest climate change science in its planning. Then Democrat Roy Cooper was elected and pulled an aggressive U turn going as far as to sign an executive order committing the state to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. In 38 states governors also appoint utility commissioners who shape investment in energy infrastructure and can help decide whether to keep an aging coal plant online or to rapidly deploy renewables. That gives states like Nevada another lever to drive climate policies. Legislatures in several states Maine Colorado New Hampshire Connecticut New York Minnesota also saw at least one chamber flip in favor of Democrats. In 13 states Democrats now control the governorship along with upper and lower legislative chambers. This would allow them to pass aggressive renewable portfolio standards and greenhouse gas targets. But other governors races did not go as well one high profile candidate who made climate change a key part of his platforms Democratic Florida gubernatorial contender Andrew Gillum lost. As for national level candidates several House members who deny climate change like California Republican Devin Nunes held on to their seats. And Carlos Curbelo a House Republican who proposed a carbon tax was outflanked by his Democratic opponent Debbie Mucarsel Powell. Curbelo also chaired the House Climate Solutions Caucus. The 90 member group counted 45 Republicans as members but just 24 of them will return in January. Since the caucus hadnt come up with many concrete solutions yet its unclear what it will do going forward. Several state clean energy and environmental ballot initiatives were also thwarted at the polls. Measures like Colorados anti fracking Proposition 112 and Washington states Initiative 1631 to price carbon emissions were defeated in part due to a firehose of money being unleashed by fossil fuel interests. What that means is that the bulk of climate change and energy advances were going to see in the United States over the next two years will come up through state legislatures and governors offices. But dont expect too much from a divided Congress and a president who is lackadaisical about whether climate change is even a problem.	True	False	False	True	True
Some of the regular Americans who are paying the price for Scott Pruitts leadership were in Washington DC this week and I had the honor of spending the day with them and hearing their stories. As we all know Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt headed to Capitol Hill Thursday where he was grilled by members of Congress on his many ethical scandals that have been making headlines for weeks. Just two days earlier people from across the US came to Washington to testify at EPAs lone public hearing on Pruitts proposed rollbacks of protections from toxic coal ash. Their stories of coal ash contamination were heartbreaking a North Carolina town where neighbors keep getting sick a community on the Navajo Nation where people drive 15 miles to haul water for livestock. The EPA had finally put very modest coal ash safeguards in place for these communities in 2015 and now Scott Pruitt is trying to take them away. As I told EPA in my testimony Families are looking to EPA to solve the coal ash problem not abandon them. If you dont defend these standards the Sierra Club and our allies will. One small town Alabama mayor summed up the thoughts of everyone in the room when he faced EPA representatives a simply said What are you doing? Have you lost your mind? Pruitts maneuver to weaken coal ash standards has sparked grassroots outrage from red states and blue states. He is handing out yet another favor to the corporate polluters whove been and marching orders since he took over the EPA. Pruitt is weakening the protections so that millionaire utility executives dont have to pay for affordable common sense fixes to Americas mounting coal ash problem. As I heard from scientists and the many families affected who spoke at the hearing earlier this week coal ash is the primary solid waste product of coal fired power plants and it contains some of the most dangerous toxic chemicals on earth like arsenic lead mercury and chromium. The toxins raise the risk for cancer heart disease and stroke and can inflict permanent brain damage on children. Its estimated that 1.5 million children live near the coal ash storage sites which are only getting larger with each ton of coal burned. In places like and on the weve seen the tragedies that coal ash spills and leaks can cause by devastating communities contaminating water and sending people to the hospital. In 2015 after years of scientific research and public comments the EPA finalized a set of basic clean water protections from coal ash that were cheap and easy for utilities to implement. These standards required coal plant owners to do things like line new coal ash dump sites with strong waterproof materials to make sure the dangerous contents of coal ash did not leach into soil and contaminate groundwater. They also provided local communities with online tools to monitor their groundwater to make sure that toxic heavy metals from nearby coal ash waste sites were not contaminating the water they used for farming drinking and cooking. In a cruel irony Pruitt announced these rollbacks the day after EPA reporting under the new standard revealed dangerous coal ash pollution in more than 70 sites around the country. Everyone deserves clean water free from toxic coal ash and the profits of utility executives should never be held in higher regard than the health of local communities.. After nearly a year in his position Pruitt has seemed more concerned with pushing the agenda of wealthy coal executives rather than doing his job to protect the environment and the health of the people who are suffering from the pollution created by coal plants. Nothing better illustrates this than the sweetheart deal Pruitt received from the wife of a dirty energy lobbyist who had business before the EPA . For a mere 50 a night he stayed in a plush multi million dollar condo near the United States Capitol. By day Pruitt was touting his rollback efforts to make it easier for energy companies and utilities to save money by polluting and by night he slept peacefully in a bed owned by someone who energy companies and utilities hire to do their bidding on Capitol Hill. As each day goes by and we find out more about Pruitts conflicts of interests and revelations about his failed judgement however its important to remember that his failures have real world impacts on the health of the people he is supposed to be protecting. Real families will be hurt because of his decision to roll back the clean water protections against coal ash people who cant offer him sweetheart deals on luxury housing. TAKE ACTION Stop the repeal of coal ash safeguards!	False	False	False	False	True
Over the course of seven hours the top ten Democratic candidates for president in 2020 committed to radical solutions to climate change a problem that assuming the worst case scenarios are true will result in our grandchildren being much richer than we are instead of muchmuch richer. Set aside for the moment the appalling wastefulness of devoting seven hours seven consecutive hours of prime time programming to the subject. Clearly CNN wanted to make a political statement about how important it thinks climate change ought to be in the election. Good. Given that the United States is the only country in the world that has reduced emissions over the past decade and a half while growing its economy and that the main reason is the growth of hydraulic fracturing fracking which Trump has supported and almost every Democratic candidate promises to ban the only choice is to vote for the Republicans. That is if youreally care about climate change. Otherwise youre just putting party before planet. That wasnt the point CNN wanted to make. Nor was it CNNs goal to expose the ignorance and extremism of the Democratic field. Yet that is exactly what happened. Given 40 minutes apiece the aspiring Democratic contenders showed that they are willing to de industrialize the U.S. economy put millions of people out of work and lower the standard of living for tens of millions more all for the sake of science they cannot explain and do not understand. It wasnt all the candidates fault. CNN kept making scientific claims that ranged from half truths to pure baloney. Again and again for instance moderators suggested that Hurricane Dorian was caused by climate change or a sign of things to come. It isnt. But give the network partial credit for noting that plans like the Green New Deal will hurt mining and agricultural communities. Some of the candidates barely seemed to care. 1. Taxing carbon pollution.Some called it a carbon fee others called it a carbon tax. Former U.S. Rep. Beto ORourke D TX was the only one offering a cap and trade system as an alternative. All believe that you should be paying more for fuel. None suggested making it revenue neutral say by lowering payroll taxes though South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg would redistribute the money to the poor. Learn from California thats not happening. 2. Banning fracking.With the possible exception of former vice president Joe Biden who agreed last month at the second debate that he would eliminate fracking and former HUD Secretary Julin Castro who would back bans at state and local levels all of the Democrats want to ban the one innovation that has made the greatest difference for our planet in the last twenty years powered the economic recovery and made us less dependent on the Mideast. 3. Ending oil and gas exploration and extraction on public lands. The Obama administration tried it too. Never mind that some public lands have been specifically set aside for oil and gas development. There seems to be little thought about the impact that would have on the U.S. economy on fuel prices and on national security. Nor is any credit given for industry advances in environmentally friendly technology except as a warrant for more regulation. 4. Banning nuclear energy. Perhaps with Nevada the fourth state in the 2020 primary contests in mind most of the candidates objected to nuclear energy because of challenges around nuclear waste storage. Only businessman Andrew Yang and Sen. Cory Booker D NJ offered defenses of nuclear power as a zero emissions alternative with Booker making the obvious argument if you believe we need to reduce emissions quickly nuclear is the only way. 5. Banning plastic straws discouraging meat eliminatingincandescent light bulbs.Sen. Kamala Harris D CA admitted that paper straws are useless but wants to ban the plastic ones anyway based on pseudoscience. Booker a vegansays you can eat what you want thanks! but the rest want you to find another source of protein. And the candidates mocked Trump for halting the imposition of energy efficient bulbs seemingly ignorant of health risks. The craziness didnt end there. Biden blamed climate change for the cancer and thegenocide in Darfur previously thought to be the fault of Arab militias slaughtering raping and displacing black African civilians. Buttigieg said he would explain climate change to folks in the heartland by telling them God thought greenhouse gases were a sin. Bernie Sanders suggested global population control encouraged by organizations that promote abortion abroad. They all want to rejoin the Paris Climate Accords none wants to submit them to the Senate for ratification but several want to eliminate or evade the filibuster to pass the Green New Deal the green socialist manifesto written by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D NY. No compromises on the road to utopia. And plenty new material for Trumps campaign ads. Send a receipt to Jeff Zucker and file a form with the FEC.

At a conservative event in Steamboat Springs Colorado on Friday Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke pounced on the opportunity to blast his critics including the environmental terrorists he blames for wildfires in the West. The left he said is angry intolerant and uninformed when it comes to public lands and environmental issues and they arent interested in debate one of the things that have made America great. They dont want to be informed. They dont want to do the research Zinke said. They go to the same little trough of Kool Aid every day. And they dont want to expand their paradigm and look at the actual facts. On Sunday Zinke traveled to fire ravaged California where he made it abundantly clear that the Trump administration has no interest in the scientific research showing climate change is contributing to the extreme fires raging across the West or that the effect on wildfires is expected to grow as climate change drives up global temperatures and fuels droughts. Ive heard the climate change argument back and forth. This has nothing to do with climate change he told KCRA TV in Sacramento. This has to do with active forest management. It doesnt matter whether you believe or dont believe in climate change he said during another interview this weekend while touring neighborhoods torched by the deadly Carr fire west of Redding California. To be fair Zinke acknowledged that theres no doubt the fire season is getting longer the temperatures are getting hotter as The Sacramento Bee reported. But he didnt dwell on those factors and instead argued for more logging and thinning of forests while taking another swing at environmental groups that he says stand in the way of such efforts. Its true that the accumulation of fuel is among the factors that have contributed to increased fire activity and California is taking additional steps to improve forest health. But a 2016 study found that human caused climate change had doubled the amount of land that burned in Western forests over a 30 year period by significantly drying out vegetation. Thirteen of the states 20 most destructive fires on record have occurred since 2003. Coming in at No. 6 is the Carr fire which has burned more than 200000 acres destroyed 1599 structures and killed seven people including three firefighters. Additionally 15 of the states 20 largest fires have occurred since 2002. The Mendocino Complex fire which has burned nearly 300000 acres north of Santa Rosa surpassed last years Thomas fire as the largest wildfire in Californias history. California is already way ahead of where it was at this time last year both in terms of the number of fires fought and the acreage burned. That a member of President Donald Trumps Cabinet would dismiss the link between climate change and wildfire is par for the course. What makes Zinkes statements during his trip to California so astonishing is that they come two days after he stressed the importance of being informed and open minded. As HuffPost reported last week the administration appears to be using the disaster in California as an opportunity to push partisan policy. While Zinke works the logging angle Trump and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross have attempted to connect devastating California wildfires to a longstanding fight between farmers and environmentalists over water resources. The move came just two days after California fire officials dismissed Trumps claims that the fires have been exacerbated by a water shortage resulting from bad environmental laws. As they see it the problem is the one that Zinke and other administration officials refuse to acknowledge.	False	False	False	True	False
WASHINGTON President Trump'slatest effort to boost the nation's manufacturing sector is an industry friendly rewrite of air quality regulations he says pose unnecessary and outdated barriers to growth. But environmental advocates warn it would be another damaging step by an administration obsessed withderegulation at the expense of hard fought public health protections. The proposed loosening of air quality standards came in the form of a directive Trump issued Thursday instructing the EPA towork with states that have metro areas which failed to attain clean air standards. The president's primary aim the directive states is promoting domestic manufacturing and job creation. Dozens of communities across the country fail to meet Clean Air Act standards for at least one of six key pollutantsground level ozone smog particulate matter soot or smoke carbon monoxide lead sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide according to the EPA. Building or expanding major projects such as highways and manufacturing plants in these non attainment areas requires extra time and cost to make sure the increased industrial activity won't worsen air quality. And states with non attainment areas have to file plans with the EPA to show how they're confronting the problem a review process that can take years. Trump's directive orders the EPA to work with states to expedite those approvals and instructs the agency to consider whether the current process should be revised or rescinded ...to provide states with additional implementation flexibility. These actions are intended to ensure that EPA carries out its core missions of protecting the environment and improving air quality in accord with statutory requirements while reducing unnecessary impediments to new manufacturing and business expansion essential for a growing economy the presidentsaid in a statement accompanying the order. Read More Assailed as tool of industry EPA administrator Pruitt affirms importance of science Read More Exclusive EPA's Pruitt vows to continue rolling back rules despite alarming climate report Read More Scott Pruitt on a mission to change the climate of the EPA The directive comes at a time when the EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has been under increasing bipartisan fire on Capitol Hill for a number of management missteps spending decisions and potential ethical conflicts. The president has staunchly defended Pruitt largely because Trump and his conservative allies applaud how aggressively the EPA is rolling back regulations and promoting economic growth. In the 14 months he's been the nation's top environmental rulemaker the former Oklahoma attorney general who sued the EPA more than a dozen times has rolled back the Clean Power Plan rescinded the Waters of the U.S. rule and helped convince the president to back out of the Paris Accord on climate change among a number of changes. And Trump's vow to bring back coal important in mining states like West Virginia where he just visitedhave been buoyed by Pruitt's actions. The air quality directive doesnt instruct the EPA to revise the air quality standards themselves. Instead environmental advocates worry the administration would try to circumvent clean air standards without congressional say so by pursuing steps that could make it easier for industry to meet current regulations without being required to improve the quality of the air Americans beatheevery day. One of those steps they say would allow states to expand the size of non attainment areas to include areas with cleaner air so that overall pollutant levels meet environmental standards. Another would permit the EPA to discount many studies used as the basis for air quality standards for a lack of transparency because those analyses use individual health datathat cant be disclosed because they're protected under federal privacy laws. This is a backhanded way of weakening the most important and sacrosanct provision of theclean Air Act and he's nodoing it through any normal legislative process said Bill Becker former executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies which represents state regulators. Trumps action empowers Pruitt to ignore science and data in determining compliance with air quality standards saidSara JordanLegislative Representative for the League of Conservation Voters. By directing the EPA to reconsider all of its past guidance from the federal air quality program Trump is threatening clean air protections for cities across the country she said. This is yet another example of this administration selling out our future to industry polluters. Industry representatives say the maze of federal rules governing a slew of environmental and health standards are unnecessary and burdensome. If states had more wiggle room in how they measure and apply air quality standards thousandsof jobs could be created they said. Over the years regulations on air quality have become so complicated that it can be nearly impossible for manufacturers to secure the needed approvals just to open a new facility said Ross Eisenberg Vice President for Energy and Resources Policy with the NationalAssociation of Manufacturers. EPA officials point out that much progress has been made on air quality in recent decades.Levels of Nitrogen Dioxide NOx for example have dropped by more than 50 percent since 2000. There are no monitors in the U.S. currently measuring pollution above those standards. The order encourages federal and state regulators to speed up reviews of air quality permits echoing Trump's call for quicker approvals involving infrastructure projects such as bridges roads and pipelines. But Beckersaid that comes off as a hollow demand considering the president's budget calls for significant cuts in EPA personnel and state environmental grants that help pay for such reviews. One of the most troubling aspects of Trump's order is that it's directing an agency established to reduce pollution to make job creation an expresspriority saidJohn Walke director of theNatural Resources Defense Council's clean air program. The memo encourages reliance on air pollution modeling for deregulatory purposes or permits desired by industry but not for regulatory purposes that would better protect Americans he said.

Staff at the US Department of Agriculture USDA have been told to avoid using the term climate change in their work with the officials instructed to reference weather extremes instead. A series of emails obtained by the Guardian between staff at the Natural Resources Conservation Service NRCS a USDA unit that oversees farmers land conservation show that the incoming Trump administration has had a stark impact on the language used by some federal employees around climate change. A missive from Bianca Moebius Clune director of soil health lists terms that should be avoided by staff and those that should replace them. Climate change is in the avoid category to be replaced by weather extremes. Instead of climate change adaption staff are asked to use resilience to weather extremes. The primary cause of human driven climate change is also targeted with the term reduce greenhouse gases blacklisted in favor of build soil organic matter increase nutrient use efficiency. Meanwhile sequester carbon is ruled out and replaced by build soil organic matter. In her email to staff dated 16 February this year Moebius Clune said the new language was given to her staff and suggests it be passed on. She writes that we wont change the modeling just how we talk about it there are a lot of benefits to putting carbon back in the sail sic climate mitigation is just one of them and that a colleague from USDAs public affairs team gave advice to tamp down on discretionary messaging right now. In contrast to these newly contentious climate terms Moebius Clune wrote that references to economic growth emerging business opportunities in the rural US agro tourism and improved aesthetics should be tolerated if not appreciated by all. In a separate email to senior employees on 24 January just days after Trumps inauguration Jimmy Bramblett deputy chief for programs at the NRCS said It has become clear one of the previous administrations priority is not consistent with that of the incoming administration. Namely that priority is climate change. Please visit with your staff and make them aware of this shift in perspective within the executive branch. Bramblett added that prudence should be used when discussing greenhouse gases and said the agencys work on air quality regarding these gases could be discontinued. Other emails show the often agonized discussions between staff unsure of what is forbidden. On 16 February a staffer named Tim Hafner write to Bramblett I would like to know correct terms I should use instead of climate changes and anything to do with carbon ... I want to ensure to incorporate correct terminology that the agency has approved to use. On 5 April Suzanne Baker a New York based NRCS employee emailed a query as to whether staff are allowed to publish work from outside the USDA that use climate change. A colleague advises that the issue be determined in a phone call. Some staff werent enamored with the new regime with one employee stating on an email on 5 July that we would prefer to keep the language as is and stressing the need to maintain the scientific integrity of the work. In a statement USDA said that on 23 January it had issued interim operating procedures outlining procedures to ensure the new policy team has an opportunity to review policy related statements legislation budgets and regulations prior to issuance. The statement added This guidance similar to procedures issued by previous administrations was misinterpreted by some to cover data and scientific publications. This was never the case and USDA interim procedures will allow complete objective information for the new policy staff reviewing policy decisions. Kaveh Sadeghzadeh of the Natural Resources Conservation Service added that his organisation has not received direction from USDA or the administration to modify its communications on climate change or any other topic. Trump has repeatedly questioned the veracity of climate change research infamously suggesting that it is part of an elaborate Chinese hoax. The president has started the process of withdrawing the US from the Paris climate agreement has instructed the Environmental Protection Agency EPA to scrap or amend various regulations aimed at cutting greenhouse gases and has moved to open up more public land and waters to fossil fuel activity. The nomenclature of the federal government has also shifted as these new priorities have taken hold. Mentions of the dangers of climate change have been removed from the websites of the White House and the Department of the Interior while the EPA scrapped its entire online climate section in April pending a review that will be updating language to reflect the approach of new leadership. These records reveal Trumps active censorship of science in the name of his political agenda said Meg Townsend open government attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. To think that federal agency staff who report about the air water and soil that sustains the health of our nation must conform their reporting with the Trump administrations anti science rhetoric is appalling and dangerous for America and the greater global community. The Center for Biological Diversity is currently suing several government agencies including the EPA and state department to force them to release information on the censoring of climate change verbiage. While some of the changes to government websites may have occurred anyway the emails from within the USDA are the clearest indication yet that staff have been instructed to steer clear of acknowledging climate change or its myriad consequences. US agriculture is a major source of heat trapping gases with 15 of the countrys emissions deriving from farming practices. A USDA plan to address the far reaching impacts of climate change is still online. However Sam Clovis Trumps nomination to be the USDAs chief scientist has labeled climate research junk science. Last week it was revealed that Clovis who is not a scientist once ran a blog where he called progressives race traders and race traitors and likened Barack Obama to a communist.

Fans of Greta Thunberg have expressed relief after the 16 year old posted a string of smiling photographs on Instagram. The environmental activist's recent images taken while touring Canada's east coast in Montreal and Quebec are in sharp contrast to images of the 16 year old speaking in an emotionally charged appearance last month at the Climate Action Summit 2019 in New York. A photo of Greta scowling when she spotted Donald Trump went viral. The teenage campaigner who has 7.2million followers on Instagram looks decidedly happier since she crossed the border from the US something which her followers haven't failed to notice. Writing on Instagram Greta said 'So happy to say that the following weeks I'll travel slowly through the North American continent moving southwest and then eventually through South America towards Santiago. I will stop on the way and visit as many places as I can and of course protest every Friday no matter where I am.' Yesterday the teenager posted an image of herself at the Marine Mammal Interpretation Centre in Tadoussac Qubec after spending a morning watching whales. The tone of Greta's images have changed significantly since she addressed the United Nations Climate Summit on September 23rd where she came close to tears in a emotional speech to international delegates. She told them 'I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us for hope. How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words' During the same appearance Greta was seen at the UN headquarters with an enraged expression on her face as US President Donald Trump upstaged her entrance by walking in flanked by news reporters an image that promptly went viral. Among the comments posted by the environmentalist's followers many remarked how much happier the teenager had looked in recent days. On Instagram Jesuissuzette wrote 'Greta you look so much happier now that youre out of America. Enjoy your travels. And thank you for your intrepid Climate Crisis campaign.' Last week Thunberg addressed on social media the negativity she's received for speaking out on climate change saying 'Here we go again... As you may have noticed the haters are as active as ever going after me my looks my clothes my behaviour and my differences. They come up with every thinkable lie and conspiracy theory. It seems they will cross every possible line to avert the focus since they are so desperate not to talk about the climate and ecological crisis. Being different is not an illness and the current best available science is not opinions its facts.' Greta who is taking a sabbatical year from school arrived in North America in August taking a two week crossing on carbon neutral yacht Malizia II to address the United Nations. Greta Thunberg's fiery speech at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York This is all wrong. I shouldnt be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to me for hope? How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet Im one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you! For more than 30 years the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you are doing enough when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight. You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency. But no matter how sad and angry I am I dont want to believe that. Because if you fully understood the situation and still kept on failing to act then you would be evil. And I refuse to believe that. The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50 chance of staying below 1.5C degrees and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control. Maybe 50 is acceptable to you. But those numbers dont include tipping points most feedback loops additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution or the aspects of justice and equity. They also rely on my and my childrens generation sucking hundreds of billions of tonnes of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist. So a 50 risk is simply not acceptable to us we who have to live with the consequences. To have a 67 chance of staying below a 1.5C global temperature rise the best odds given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the world had 420 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide left to emit back on 1 January 2018. Today that figure is already down to less than 350 gigatonnes. How dare you pretend that this can be solved with business as usual and some technical solutions. With todays emissions levels that remaining CO2 budget will be entirely gone in less than eight and a half years. There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures today. Because these numbers are too uncomfortable. And you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is. You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming whether you like it or not.	False	True	False	True	True
Nearly 10000 farmers and ranchers are endorsing the Green New Deal as the climate policy battleground expands from the oil fields to the agricultural fields. In a letter sent to Congresson Wednesday morning the newly formed bipartisan coalition U.S. Farmers Ranchers for a Green New Deal threw its weight behind the sweeping industrial plan outlined in a resolution that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D N.Y. proposed in February. But zeroing out the countrys planet heating emissions by mid century requires a transformation in agriculture as dramatic as shifting the energy sector away from fossil fuels the letter says. We believe these climate goals are achievable the letter argues but only if the GND includes policies that spur two large scale transitions the transition away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy alternatives and the transition away from industrial agriculture toward family farm based organic and regenerative farming and land use practices that improve soil health and draw down and sequester carbon. The letter was signed by more than 500 individual farms and 50 organizations representing close to 10000 members. Regeneration International a sustainable farming nonprofit organized the missive with the climate justice group Sunrise Movement. It also hosted a Wednesday morning press conference in Washington. A month ago the United Nations released a dire new report urging major changes to food production and land management and warning that emissions cuts alone will fall short of halting catastrophic global warming. Taking cues from those pushing for a Green New Deal several Democratic presidential hopefuls have made farming practices central to their climate proposals. Sen. Bernie Sanders I Vt. earmarked 410 billion in his Green New Deal proposal to help farms of all sizes transition to ecologically regenerative agricultural practices. Sen. Elizabeth Warren D Mass. called for breaking up agriculture monopolies as part of her broad rural platform. South Bend Indiana MayorPete Buttigieg vowed to support farmers by paying them to capture carbon. Yet even as farmers reel from the effects of President Donald Trumps trade war with China Democratic candidates are far from guaranteed their votes. Farmers supported the Trump administrations proposal last week tofinalize the rollback of the Obama era Waters of the U.S. rule which had put new restrictions on which waterways agribusiness could pollute. Early on Republican opposition to the Green New Deal itself coalesced around the idea that such a program would ban beef production although supporters have clearly said it would not. We call on Congress to put the Green in the Green New Deal Wednesdays letter reads by empowering us to revitalize the health and economic security of this countrys middle class to make family farming economically viable again and to help reverse climate change and improve Americas air and water quality by making our ecosystems healthy again.

It is a landmark deal that has been more than two decades in the making. Russia Iran Azerbaijan Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan all bordering the Caspian Sea have agreed in principle on how to divide it up. Their leaders signed the Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea in the Kazakh city of Aktau on Sunday. It establishes a formula for dividing up its resources and prevents other powers from setting up a military presence there. It is an important step in the easing of regional tensions but the deal over the world's largest inland body of water matters for several reasons. Here's what you need to know about the hotly disputed Caspian Sea. It would be reasonable to assume that the Caspian Sea is well a sea. But at the heart of this long running dispute is whether or not the 370000 sq km 143000 sq mile body of landlocked water should be considered a lake. Until the dissolution of the Soviet Union USSR in 1991 that's what it was known as and shared between the USSR and Iran. But the arrival on the scene of new countries complicated this issue with ensuing claim and counterclaim. Iran had argued it was a lake and not a sea but none of the four other countries agreed. Why is the difference so important? If it was treated as a sea then it would be covered by international maritime law namely the United Nations Law of the Sea. This binding document sets rules on how countries can use the world's oceans. It covers areas such as the management of natural resources territorial rights and the environment. And it is not limited to littoral states meaning others can seek access to its resources. But if it is defined as a lake then it would have to be divided equally between all five countries. Sunday's agreement goes some way to settling this dispute. The signed convention gives the body of water a special legal status which means it is not defined as a sea or a lake Russian officials said. The surface water will be in common usage meaning freedom of access for all littoral states beyond territorial waters. But the seabed which is rich in natural resources will be divided up. It's difficult to say as the final text of the deal is yet to be published. Another key factor is that seabed boundaries are yet to be negotiated although now it's the subject of bilateral agreements not multilateral as before. But because the deal does not define the Caspian as a lake Iran which has the smallest coastline is viewed as a potential loser. Iranian social media users have accused the government in Tehran of selling off the Caspian Sea on Sunday. However Iran which is currently under growing political and economic pressure from the West might see some political benefits in securing the clause that bars any armed presence on the Caspian other than that of the five littoral states. Had the Caspian been defined as a lake Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan who have established an early claim over large areas of the Caspian stood to lose out under such a split. So the basis of all previous disagreements stems from who gets access to what. This is important because... The Caspian Sea is highly prized for its vast oil and gas reserves. It's estimated there are 50 billion barrels of oil and nearly 300 trillion cubic feet 8.4 trillion cubic metres of natural gas beneath its seabed. That is why disagreements over how to divide some of its huge oil and gas fields have been numerous and acrimonious. On occasion warships have been deployed to scare off contractors hired by rival countries. The disagreement over its legal status has also prevented a natural gas pipeline being built across the Caspian between Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan. This would have allowed Turkmen gas to bypass Russia on its way to Europe. Russia a major exporter of gas and oil to Europe has previously objected to this. International oil companies that rushed to the Caspian in the 1990s have now pulled out. But there is a possibility this could be explored further following Sunday's deal. The Caspian Sea has a number of different species of sturgeon the fish that yields the highly prized delicacy caviar. Between 80 90 of the world's caviar is sourced from the Caspian but the numbers have been falling over the past few decades. In 2002 a survey found that the fish was rapidly disappearing and could soon become extinct. It also found an abnormally large proportion of young sturgeon in comparison to more mature fish which produce the eggs used to make caviar. In response various bans on sturgeon fishing in the Caspian Sea and on the caviar trade more generally have been introduced. Significantly Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev said on Sunday that the recent agreement allowed the setting of national quotas for fishing. The Caspian Sea has long suffered pollution from oil extraction and other industries. Oil pollution has affected the migration routes of sturgeon according to the UN's Caucasus Environment Outlook. It says sturgeon swim through highly polluted water near Azerbaijan's Absheron Peninsula and that is believed to limit their food and oxygen. A more recent concern is bacterial pollution caused by sewage from Iran which is adding to the threats facing sturgeon fish. The Caspian Sea's disputed legal status was also a risk factor for the environment as no enforcement would have been possible to deal with a major oil spill or other pollution incident in disputed waters.

Warmer temperatures are threatening American songbirds with dwindling numbers due to an inability to successfully breed a new study from Scientific Reports alleges. A team of researchers studied migratory patterns of songbirds between 2001 and 2012 and claimed that of the 48 North American songbird species that migrate north nine of these or almost 20 percent didnt reach the grounds by the deadline critical for mating and breeding the next generation of birds wrote Karla Lant in her summary of the report Plants in eastern North America are greening up sooner than normal because of global warming the report contends while plants in the western part of the continent are somehow undergoing the process later. This means that birds such as the Townsends warbler and the rose breasted grosbeak are arriving either too soon and being met with frigid temperatures or too late and missing out on the insect boom that coincides with the new plant growth Lant stated. Either way the birds have a much lower chance of surviving and reproducing the report alleges so the nine species identified are consequently in danger of dwindling numbers. As climate at the breeding grounds changes birds may be unable to adjust wintering ground departure times and transit speeds sufficiently to match their arrival with altered breeding resource phenology particularly leaf growth and the closely associated emergence of herbivorous insects the report warns. If attributing changes in migratory patterns of songbirds to global warming after a mere 12 years of observation strikes readers as highly suspicious thats probably because it is. Event attributionthe ability to link a given phenomenon to manmade global warmingis exceedingly speculative at best and completely unreliable at worst even according to true believers. At a meeting of climate scientists at Oxford in 2012 one participant argued that given the insufficient observational data and the coarse and mathematically imperfect climate models used to generate attribution claims they are unjustifiably speculative basically unverifiable and better not made at all. Nature Magazine felt compelled to conclude with unusual modesty that better models are needed before exceptional events can be reliably linked to global warming. Of course the purpose of studies such as these which remarkably continue to receive funding is ultimately practical rather than speculative. They are meant primarily not to inform but to exhort and to put pressure on policy makers to coerce human behavior change in accordance with climate change theory. As for the fate of these migratory birds that really depends on how far were willing to go to end manmade climate change Lants article predictably concludes. Climate change is projected to drive hundreds of bird species to extinction and greatly reduce the ranges of others the report prophecies and is already impacting species richness and composition.

WASHINGTON The Trump administration is moving to roll back the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's efforts to slow global warming seeking to ease restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from coal fired power plants. In a plan expected to be made public in coming days the Environmental Protection Agency EPA declared the Obama era rule exceeded federal law by setting emissions standards that power plants could not reasonably meet. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the 43 page document which underscored President Trump's bid to revive the struggling coal industry. The EPA's new proposal would make good on Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to unravel Obama's efforts to curb global warming and follows Mr. Trump's promise to pull the United States out of the landmark Paris climate agreement. Nearly 200 countries have committed to combat global warming by reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. The EPA won't prescribe an immediate replacement to the plan but will seek public comment on whether to curb climate warming emissions from coal and natural gas power plants. A spokeswoman for EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt declined to comment Friday on the authenticity of the leaked document but said the Obama administration pushed the bounds of their authority so far that the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay to prevent the Clean Power Plan from taking effect. Any replacement rule that the Trump administration proposes will be done carefully and properly within the confines of the law EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said. The plan was first reported by Bloomberg News. The Obama administration's cost benefits analysis of the Clean Power Plan was highly uncertain in multiple areas Bowman said vowing that the Trump administration will present a range of scenarios to the public in a robust open and transparent way. Obama's plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions. The Supreme Court put the plan on hold last year following a legal challenge by industry and coal friendly states. Even so the plan has been a factor in a wave of retirements of coal fired plants which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power and state mandates promoting energy conservation. Repealing the Clean Power Plan without a timeline or a commitment to propose a rule to reduce carbon pollution isn't a step forward it's a wholesale retreat from EPA's legal scientific and moral obligation to address the threats of climate change' said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. While the Supreme Court has concluded that EPA is obligated to regulate greenhouse gases this administration has no intention of following the law said McCarthy who led the EPA when the Clean Power Plan was completed. They are denying it just as they are denying the science. They're using stall tactics to defer action ignoring the courts and the demands of the American people. Industry groups cheered the planned repeal saying it would reverse regulatory overreach by Obama and McCarthy. The Clean Power Plan represented an unlawful attempt to transform the nation's power grid ... and raise costs on American consumers said Hal Quinn president and CEO of the National Mining Association. The Obama era plan would have sharply reduced the number of coal fired plants making the grid more vulnerable to reliability concerns and increasing costs with trivial environmental benefits Quinn said. The new plan will save an estimated 240 million tons of annual coal production and safeguard more than 27000 mining jobs and almost 100000 additional jobs throughout the supply chain he said. In the leaked document the Trump administration argues that repealing the Clean Power Plan could spare an estimated 33 billion in compliance costs in 2030 arguing that the Obama administration overstated the rule's potential health benefits. Previously the EPA had estimated that by 2030 the Clean Power Plan would prevent 90000 asthma attacks and up to 3600 premature deaths a year. The leaked document casts doubts on those numbers and says the EPA plans to perform updated modeling and analysis of health benefits and other impacts of the rule. Liz Perera climate policy director for the Sierra Club said repealing the Clean Power Plan is about one thing and one thing only helping corporate polluters profit.	True	False	False	True	False
James Ooker Eskridge is the mayor of a town on an island disappearing in the Chesapeake Bay but rather than see it as evidence of global warming he used it to shut down Al Gores narrative that the seas are rising because of climate change. Eskridge faced the climate warming alarmist during a CNN town hall on global warming. Im a commercial crabber Eskridge said and Ive been working the Chesapeake Bay for 50 plus years. And I have a crab house business out on the water. And water level is the same as it was when the place was built in 1970. Im not a scientist but Im a keen observer and if sea level rises are occurring he asked why am I not seeing signs of it? Our island is disappearing he explained but its because of erosion and not because of sea level rising unless we get a seawall we will lose our island. But back to the question he said why am I not seeing signs of the sea level rising? What do you think the erosion is due to mayor? Gore asked. So youre losing the island even though the waves havent increased Gore said. Yes Eskridge replied his erosion has been going on since Captain John Smith discovered the island. Well arguments about science arent necessarily going to be any comfort to you and Im sorry for what youre going through Gore said. It wont necessarily do you any good for me to tell you that the scientists do say that the sea level is rising in the Chesapeake Bay he continued and that youve lost about two thirds of your island already over a longer period of time. And the forecast for the future is another two feet of sea if there was another two feet of sea level rise what would that mean for Tangier Island? Tangier Island our elevation is only about 4feet above level Eskridge said and if I see sea level rise occurring Ill shout it from the housetops we dont have you know the land to give up. But Im just not seeing it he said. Eskridges plight to save his island reached mainstream media attention when President Donald Trump called him after seeing a CNN report about the disappearing islands Trump supporting mayor. Trump reportedly told him to not worry about his island and that it would be there for many hundreds of years more. It wasnt clear if he addressed the seawall construction to save the island. Gore is currently making the rounds to publicize the sequel to his global climate documentary An Inconvenient Truth. Recentlyhe said that the global warming fight was in the same vein as great moral causes of humanity in the past like the Civil Rights cause of the 60s and abolition.	True	False	False	True	False
A coalition of states filed a legal challenge Wednesday against the Trump administrations decision to roll back a slew of Obama era climate regulations. The legal motion comes after Trump signed an executive order targeting climate change regulations ushered in by former President Barack Obama.The New York led group of states argue Trumps Environmental Protections Agency has a legal obligation to regulate emissions some climate scientists believe contribute to global warming. The law is clear the EPA must limit carbon pollution from power plants New York Attorney General EricSchneiderman who is leading the legal challengesaid in a statement.Other statesbehind the challenge include California Delaware Maryland and Massachusetts. The motion asks the District of Columbia U.S. Court of Appeals to toss out a request fromthe Trump administration for a delay in the court proceedings on an Obama era policy known as the Clean Power Plan. Trumps executive order was largely aimed at halting the Clean Power Plan whichrequired states to slash carbon dioxide emissions from coal power plants. The plan was never implemented however because it was challenged in court by 26 Republican led states. The Trump administrationsays this and other Obama era rules hinder the American economy and create a stultifying business environment. The coalition of states argued in a statement the delay would waste the substantial resources already expended in this litigation according to a statement from the group. Schneiderman hired Howard Master a prosecutor who served under an Obama appointed U.S. attorney to focus on corruption cases involving the Trump administration.Masters primary responsibility according to Schneidermans office will be investigating and possibly prosecuting the Trump administration for possible civil rights abuses. Schneidermans decision to hire Master may indicate the crusading AG plans to flood Trump and his administration with legal filings subpoenas and lawsuitsThe Wall Street Journal reported. Master will be working on a wide range of civil and criminal investigations and enforcement matters including public corruption complex civil litigation Eric Soufer a spokesman for Schneiderman told WSJ. Schneidermanhas made fighting what he calls man made global warming a crucial part of his duties as New Yorkstop law office. Hehas engaged in a months long investigation into whether Exxon Mobilillegally hid internal climate research from the public and shareholders. The Democrat based the bulk of his probes on research from left leading media outlets many of which receive funding from wealthy environmental groups.

WASHINGTON The Senate on Thursday confirmed former coal industry lobbyist Andrew Wheeler to lead the Environmental Protection Agency despite concerns by Democrats and one Republican about regulatory rollbacks hes made in eight months as the agencys acting chief. Senators voted 52 47 to confirm Wheeler who was nominated by President Donald Trump after former administrator Scott Pruitt resigned last year amid a series of ethics allegations. Sen. John Barrasso R Wyo. chairman of the Senate environment committee called Wheeler uniquely qualified to lead EPA and said that under Wheeler the agency is putting forward proposals that both protect our environment and allow the countrys economy to flourish. But Sen. Tom Udall D N.M. said Wheeler was failing to protect the environment and human health and was nominated to unravel and undo the environmental protections that are now in place. Wheeler 54 was confirmed as deputy administrator last April and became acting chief in July after Pruitt resigned. He worked at the EPA early in his career and was a top aide at the Senate Environment Committee before becoming a lobbyist a decade ago. Maine Sen. Susan Collins was the sole Republican to oppose Wheeler. She said in a statement that unlike Pruitt Wheeler understands the mission of the EPA and acts in accordance with ethical standards. However the policies he has supported as acting administrator are not in the best interest of our environment and public health particularly given the threat of climate change to our nation. Collins said she was particularly concerned that EPA has proposed to roll back rules regulating mercury emissions from power plants and moved to replace the Clean Power Plan former President Barack Obamas signature proposal to combat climate change. There is no doubt that the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change pose a significant threat to Maine and the nation Collins said adding that pollution from coal fired power plants threatens Maines natural resources from our working forests fishing and agricultural industries to tourism and recreation. VIDEO At his confirmation hearing in January Wheeler told lawmakers that climate change is a huge issue but not the greatest crisis. Video by PBS NewsHour Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia who supported Wheelers nomination as deputy last year voted against his promotion. Wheeler was not making meaningful progress on clean water standards Manchin said citing the agencys failure to limit the amount of highly toxic chemicals contaminating drinking water in West Virginia and around the country. The EPA has announced plans to place legal limits on the chemicals but has not yet done so. The perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances known collectively as PFAS have been linked to health threats ranging from cancer to decreased fertility. I believe immediate action must be taken and these efforts lack a sense of urgency Manchin said. Like Collins Manchin also said he was concerned at EPAs attempt to undo rules designed to limit emissions of mercury which can damage the brains of infants and young children. Environmental groups meanwhile slammed Wheeler saying that while his behavior is less cartoonish than Pruitt he supports the same policies. Wheeler wants to turn the EPA into a wish granting service for polluters no matter the cost to public health or wildlife. But its only a matter of time before his dirty dealings land him in the same trash heap as his predecessor said Emily Knobbe EPA policy specialist at the Center for Biological Diversity an Arizona based environmental group. Americas Power a trade group that represents coal producers applauded Wheelers confirmation. During his time as acting administrator Andrew Wheeler has been seen as a thoughtful leader who understands the need for sensible environmental policies said Michelle Bloodworth the groups president and CEO. Wheelers long experience in public service demonstrates his integrity in serving EPAs mission she said.

This is going to be the Great Society the moon shot the civil rights movement of our generation she said. That is the scale of the ambition that this movement is going to require. In the 2016 presidential election Sanders staked out the most ambitious climate platform of any candidate vowing to slash carbon dioxide pollution 40 percent by 2030 end fossil fuel subsidies and ban fracking. Despite stark policy differences with his chief rival in the primaries former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton supported fracking and raisedtwice as much from the oil and gas industryas her Republican opponent climate change remained a policy backwater in the election.

Rocks from northern Labrador have been found to contain the oldest known evidence of life on Earth. Graphite a form of pure carbon found in the 3.95 billion year old rocks shows the geochemical signature of having come from the decomposition of living organisms researchers report in a new study published today in Nature. That's at least 150 million years older than the oldest graphite from living organisms previously found in 3.7 billion to 3.8 billion year old rocks in Greenland and northern Quebec. It's also not much more than 500 million years after the Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago. Some of the signatures in the Labrador rocks suggests that the organisms that left them were autotrophic that is they could produce their own food from chemicals in their environment as algae and some kinds of bacteria do report researchers led by Takayuki Tashiro and Tsuyoshi Komiya at the University of Tokyo. The discovery suggests not only that there may have been life but there may have been abundant enough life that you could get carbon rich sediments said Beth Ann Bell a geochemist at the University of California Los Angeles who was not involved in the study but called the findings pretty cool. It adds to evidence that the Earth at that time had surface water and other conditions to support life and wasn't as hot and as inhospitable as scientists used to think said Daniele Pinti a geochemist at the University of Quebec at Montreal. He was also not involved in the study but supervised one of the co authors Pauline Mjean during her PhD in Canada. Pinti said that researchers have been increasingly interested in the rocks of the Uivak Gneiss in the Saglek Block of northern Labrador in recent years because they contain some of the oldest rocks on the surface of the Earth. Such old rocks are very rare because the Earth's crust is constantly being recycled back into the planet's interior through a process called plate tectonics. The Labrador rocks are likely a small patch that remains from a very ancient continent Pinti said It's a very special place. Because such rocks are so rare very little is known about the Earth at that time although it's known that the interior of the Earth was much hotter than it is now and there is some evidence of liquid water on the surface. Were there ponds? Were there oceans? That's uncertain Bell said. What makes the Labrador rocks particularly special is that they are the oldest known metasedimentary rocks in the world. That is they were originally formed from sediments deposited by water the type of environment that decaying organic remains often end up in said Bell. The meta part of the word indicates that the rocks have been metamorphosed or transformed by heat and pressure over time They've been cooked pretty well Bell explains. That makes them harder to analyze but not impossible. Graphite the dark substance found in pencil leads can be formed from chemical reactions of inorganic minerals such as limestone. But it can also be formed when decaying organic matter gets heated up to several hundred degrees. Scientists can tell the difference by looking at the type of carbon found in the graphite. Carbon atoms come in different isotopes or forms with different masses carbon 12 carbon 13 and carbon 14 which you may have heard of because it's used in radiocarbon dating. Carbon 12 is the most common and the kind that organisms tend to disproportionately take into their bodies. That means graphite that comes from living things tends to be lighter than graphite from inorganic sources. To figure out whether graphite came from a living or non living source researchers use instruments to compare the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13. Of course things get more complicated when the graphite has been exposed to heat and pressure which can change the carbon ratios. There's also the possibility that the rocks could have become contaminated in the nearly four billion years after they were formed. But the researchers took great pains to test for contamination account for the exposure to heat and pressure and extrapolate back the original ratios Pinti said. For the moment it looks very convincing he added. Pinti said one interesting thing about the carbon signature is that it can indicate not just whether the graphite came from living organisms but what kind of metabolism those organisms had. The researchers write that the ratio found in one sample provides the oldest evidence for autotrophs organisms that can produce their own food either through photosynthesis or by using inorganic compounds such as sulphur in their environment. In this case the organisms appear to use a metabolic pathwaysimilar to modern microbes that turn carbon dioxide into methane and acetate. And they say their work could be relevant to places beyond our own planet that may have harsher environments than today's Earth. The discovery will provide insight into early life not only on Earth but also on other planets.	False	True	False	True	True
As protesters prepare for nationwide demonstrations against Donald Trumps environmental agenda Bernie Sanders on Thursday backed legislation that would phase out the use of fossil fuels in the US by 2050. Mr President start listening to the people and the scientists not the greed of the fossil fuel industry Sanders said at a rally on Capitol Hill where he was flanked by environmental advocates and two of his Democratic colleagues Senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon who authored the bill and Ed Markey of Massachusetts. As you all know the Vermont senator and former presidential candidate told the crowd Donald Trump is wrong about a lot of things. But there is no area where he is more wrong than on the issue of climate change. Sanders added No Mr President climate change is not a hoax. Climate change is real. At the event held just outside the US Capitol Sanders Merkley and Markey unveiled legislation which seeks to completely phase out the use of fossil fuels through a transition to 100 clean and renewable energy by the middle of this century. But the bill called the 100 by 50 Act is unlikely to be considered by a Republican controlled Congress where many GOP lawmakers are still unwilling to acknowledge the science behind global warming and contribution of human activity. The partisan nature of the debate was not lost on the audience as one attendee interrupted the proceedings to ask Where are the Republicans? Were going to have to recruit those colleagues across the aisle said Merkley who ranks among the Senates most progressive voices. This is not a red or a blue issue he said. There is no excuse for failure. This is the biggest test facing human civilization and we have to respond and win this battle. Demonstrators are set to gather in Washington for the Peoples Climate March on Saturday which will also mark the 100th day of the Trump administration. Similar marches are expected in major cities across the US as part of a broader effort to oppose Trumps efforts to roll back the climate initiatives put in place by Barack Obama. The president has signaled his intentions to tear up the landmark Paris climate agreement forged by more than 195 nations in late 2015 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 over a decade. Trumps top aides who are split on whether or not the US should remain part of the Paris accord were scheduled to meet on Thursday afternoon to discuss the deals future. Trumps chief of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt is a vocal proponent of pulling out immediately. Trump has vowed to withdraw from the Paris agreement and has already taken steps through executive action to begin the process of overturning Obama era environmental regulations. Among them was a directive to the EPA to dismantle the Clean Power Plan one of Obamas signature climate policies to reduce carbon pollution from power plants. Trump also signed an executive order that aims to unravel the Obama rule designed to protect American waterways from pollution and proposed in his budget draconian cuts to the EPA. At the rally Markey said Trumps actions were precisely why hundreds of thousands of people felt compelled to take to the streets. Donald Trump is still saying that hes going to issue a new executive order allowing for more oil drilling on the public lands of the United States of America he said drawing jeers for the president from the crowd. That is just completely and totally unacceptable.	True	False	False	True	False
In April for the first time ever the US produced more energy from renewable sources than from coal in a single month. According to data from the US Energy Information Administration hydroelectric dams solar panels and wind turbines generated 68.5 million megawatt hours of energy during the month of April 2019. This was compared to 60 million megawatt hours of energy produced from coal in the same month. The trend comes despite President Donald Trump pledging to 'bring back' the coal industry which has been hit hard by competition from cheaper natural gas and renewable energy. The US has been shifting toward natural gas which is not only cheaper than coal but also emits less carbon dioxide. However experts noted that several coal plants were down for routine maintenance in April and the month saw an increase in wind generation and a drop in energy demand. This suggests that coal could easily take over from renewable sources in the following months. Despite this areport from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis IEEFA said that the trend could potentially extend into the month of May. The trend will happen sporadically throughout the next several years says the IEEFA as renewable energy becomes cheaper and the world's attention focuses on mitigating the effects of carbon fueled climate change by turning away from fossil fuels. Growth in both solar and wind power has been particularly stark with the former producing 48 times more electricity than it did a decade ago due to cheaper equipment and government incentives. Coupled with a rise in renewables has been a trend of declining coal consumption. Last year coal hit a nearly 40 year low in terms of proportional usage in the U.S. Coal has fallen out of favor in part due to decreasing costs of natural gas. In 2016 it was dethroned as the America's fuel of choice by natural gas a feat aided in part by a thriving hydro fracking industry that continues to pump abundant fossil fuels out of the Bakken Oil Shale in North Dakota. The Trump administration on Wednesday completed one of its biggest rollbacks of environmental rules replacing a landmark Obama era effort that sought to wean the nation's electrical grid off coal fired power plants and their climate damaging pollution. Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler a former coal industry lobbyist signed a replacement rule that gives states leeway in deciding whether to require efficiency upgrades at existing coal plants. Wheeler said coal fired power plants remained essential to the power grid something that opponents deny. 'Americans want reliable energy that they can afford' he said at a news conference. There's no denying 'the fact that fossil fuels will continue to be an important part of the mix' he said.	True	True	False	True	False
Humans must drastically alter food production to prevent the most catastrophic effects of global warming according to a new report from the United Nations panel on climate change. The panel of scientists looked at the climate change effects of agriculture deforestation and other land use such as harvesting peat and managing grasslands and wetlands. Together those activities generate about a third of human greenhouse gas emissions including more than 40 of methane. That's important because methane is particularly good at trapping heat in the atmosphere. And the problem is getting more severe. Emissions from agricultural production are projected to increase the authors warn. Delaying action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions they continue could result in some irreversible impacts on some ecosystems. This is the latest in a series of reports from the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The new report adds weight and detail to a warning put out by the same panel of scientists last fall in which they sounded the alarm about the inadequacy of the pledges countries have made so far to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. At that time the panel broadly suggested that farmland would need to shrink and forests would need to grow to keep Earth from getting more than 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than it was in the preindustrial era. Global temperatures have already risen about 1 degree Celsius in the past 150 years. To meet that temperature target global greenhouse gas emissions will need to fall by 40 to 50 in the next decade. Scientists say the only way to achieve that reduction is to significantly increase the amount of land that's covered in trees and other vegetation and significantly reduce the amount of methane and other greenhouse gases that come from raising livestock such as cows sheep and goats. The new report offers some broad suggestions for how countries might achieve that. For example for countries that have lost tree cover in the past century reforestation can help suck greenhouse gases out of the air while also preventing soil from drying up. Reducing food waste can also help reduce a country's greenhouse gas footprint. Controlling emissions from agriculture is also a food security issue. Greenhouse gases from food production create a vicious cycle As Earth gets hotter farming gets more difficult in many places which forces farmers to clear more land to grow food. Climate change including increases in frequency and intensity of extremes has adversely impacted food security and terrestrial ecosystems as well as contributed to desertification and land degradation in many regions the report's authors write. If greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase as they are doing today it will exacerbate those challenges and eventually make it all but impossible to control global warming without creating serious food shortages. The U.N. panel is the latest group of experts to grapple with a global conundrum how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture deforestation and other land use without creating food shortages or displacing people whose livelihoods rely on practices that are unsustainable globally. Scientists and economists have been studying the effects of our diets on the environment for years. There's a growing consensus that a transition to a more plant centered diet would help. Currently about 50 of the globe's vegetated land is dedicated to agriculture and about 30 of cropland is used to grow grain for animal feed. Given how much land it takes to grow food to feed livestock meat production is a leading cause of deforestation. A report released last month by the World Resources Institute finds that if current dietary patterns continue an additional 593 million hectares which is almost twice the size of India would be needed to feed the projected 9.8 billion people the anticipated population by 2050. Right now agriculture generates an estimated 25 of annual greenhouse gas emissions according to the WRI that's when you combine food production and the land use changes associated with farming such as clearing vegetation and plowing. If current trends continue but agricultural productivity does not increase beyond 2010 levels the WRI report concludes that most of the globe's remaining forests would need to be cleared to feed the world. And the globe would exceed the greenhouse gas emission targets set by the Paris climate agreement.	True	False	False	True	False
Wildfires are raging through Californias wine country. Flooded homes in Houston Texas are still rotting. Puerto Ricans are languishing in darkness collecting drinking water from streams. And South Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands were still picking through the rubble as yet another hurricane made landfall over the mouth of the Mississippi River. Scientists say the frequency and severity of natural disasters like these are linked to climbing global temperatures. But the Trump administration on Tuesday announced plans to repeal the United States only major policy to combat climate change. The Clean Power Plan a set of Obama era regulations aimed at slashing emissions from coal fired power plants and boosting renewable energy production had yet to go into effect after being temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court since February 2016. On Tuesday afternoon Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt who sued to halt the plan last year when he was Oklahomas attorney general released a proposal to eliminate the policy without any replacement leaving the country without a national strategy to adapt to global warming. Rain soaked the state last winter stacking its mountains with colossal snowdrifts and quenching soil left parched after more than half a decade of historic drought. But record breaking heat baked the West in July and August drying its woodlands and leaving it vulnerable to the sort of blaze now engulfing the wine producing region neighboring San Francisco. These people have either no sense or a very sophisticated sense of irony to be doing this at this timehe added referring to the Trump administration. Following an exceptionally hot summer 172 fires 78 of which qualified as large incidents according to the National Interagency Fire Center burned more than 8 million acres in western Montana and the Pacific Northwest. Thats almost doublethe 10 year average of 5.5 million acres. Elsewhere a spate of fierce hurricanes inundated parts of the South and Caribbean. Warmer oceans tend to exacerbate storms and shift their directions. After Hurricane Harvey dumped 30 inches of rain on Houston in August scientists warned that the Category 4 storm served as a teachable example of the type of weather event their models predict will become more common as the planet continues to warm. The next few weeks proved Mother Nature to be a cruel instructor. Hurricane Irma rampaged through the Caribbean before slamming into Florida as a Category 5 beast knocking out power for millions and ultimately killing 69 people. Less than two weeks later Hurricane Maria pummeled Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands crippling the U.S. territories power grids and leaving whole areas uninhabitable. In Puerto Rico which has a larger population than 21 U.S. states the death toll continues to climb hitting 39 this week as the islands aging utility struggles to rebuild electrical transmission wires. But the proposal to scrap the policy without any kind of replacement to curb greenhouse gases underscores the extent to which the Trump administrations refusal to acknowledge basic climate science is leaving the country vulnerable to global warming effects that are no longer theoretical. It is crazy to think about having an EPA administrator who has nothing to offer in replacement of an admittedly not so good regulatory solution former Rep. Bob Inglis R S.C. now the executive director of the conservative environmental advocacy group RepublicEn told HuffPost by phone on Tuesday. To get rid of the Clean Power Plan without any idea of what to do that could be better is malfeasance on the part of the EPA administrator.	False	True	False	True	True
When Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull arrives in Washington this week for consultations with President Donald Trump he won't be traveling solo. Turnbull is bringing the most senior Australian political and business delegation ever to visit the United States in a trip aimed at building stronger relationships with America's governors. While he'll talk trade and security concerns with Mr. Trump Turnbull will spend the weekend courting U.S. governors at their annual gathering. Turnbull a Goldman Sachs executive turned prime minister is the latest world leader to extend outreach to U.S. governors and big city mayors in the age of Mr. Trump's America First policies. It's an end run or at least a shift in focus around Washington as foreign leaders react to Mr. Trump's unpredictability and occasional lack of interest in the sort of global cooperation they're seeking. Mr. Trump after all has announced plans to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord exit the Trans Pacific Partnership and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade deals. On certain issues like climate change these foreign leaders can't go to Washington anymore said Nicholas Burns a top State Department official during the Bush administration who also served as U.S. ambassador to NATO. This is happening more frequently because the Trump administration is pulling back on a number of its commitments. Turnbull isn't the only world leader to see the benefit of direct talks with American governors and municipal leaders. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's recent trip to the U.S. included trade and tourism talks in Illinois with Gov. Bruce Rauner and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel a stop in the San Francisco Bay area for meetings with California Gov. Jerry Brown and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and a visit to Los Angeles where he explored the city's hiking trails with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is planning an extensive U.S. tour in the coming weeks with expected stops in several U.S. cities. During last fall's U.N. climate talks in Bonn Germany Brown and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg took a starring role representing a group of U.S. states cities and businesses that argued they are still committed to curbing global warming even if Mr. Trump pulls out of the Paris accord. The group which calls itself America's Pledge notes that its collective alliance has an economy larger than Japan and Germany combined and can take steps to reduce emissions by promoting renewable energy use and climate friendly transportation systems. It's hardly unprecedented for heads of government and state to make stops outside Washington on visits to the U.S. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu frequently visits New York and Los Angeles and Mr. Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar a Lago club in Florida last year. But governors and mayors say there's been an uptick in the interest of foreign leaders in reaching out to them since Mr. Trump's election. It's political and it's practical. On the political side a lack of engagement strength and leadership from Washington and the White House Garcetti said in an interview. But the practical aspect is the world demands integration and work on these things. In Los Angeles Garcetti designated Nina Hachigian a former U.S. ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations during the Obama administration to serve in a new position of deputy mayor for international affairs. Hachigian oversees the city's international portfolio from the city's dozens of foreign consulates to trade climate and tourism issues and the city's hosting of the 2028 Olympic Games. Mr. Trump's election and the nontraditional makeup of his Cabinet and administration proved that the political leadership of America over the years is not going to come exclusively from Washington said Joe Hockey the Australian ambassador to the U.S. But these days relationships have to be deeper. They need to be more thoughtful. They need to be broader. And they need to be inclusive. Turnbull and Ghana President Nana Akufo Addo will address the National Governors Association this weekend and the prime minister is bringing most of Australia's territorial premiers who will attend a joint program with their American counterparts Saturday morning. The Australian government and the NGA have partnered to bring a joint group of CEOs to Washington this weekend as well. Certainly there's some change in policy at the national level with this administration creating a bit of change and foreign governments are wanting to interpret that said Scott Pattison the NGA's executive director and chief executive officer. He said it has resulted in an increased interest on the part of U.S. governors to forge direct ties with foreign officials. This really is about interaction economic development. There is no desire on the part of governors they know their role there's not a desire to get involved in foreign policy Pattison said. But local leaders and their foreign counterparts are finding new ways to make end runs around Washington particularly on economic development and environmental policy. Last week the NGA launched a new international cooperation arm called NGA Global designed to strengthen ties between governors and foreign governments. At the last NGA meeting held July in Rhode Island Trudeau became the first foreign leader to address the NGA in its history. Last year NGA brought governors to Germany and Switzerland to study how those countries used apprenticeships to better prepare their workforces a test run for the new office. NGA is also hosting a summit of North American governors and premiers in Phoenix in May a partnership they launched with their counterparts in Mexico and Canada in 2015.	True	False	False	True	True
Mark Wilson Getty Images Climate change protesters block traffic during a protest to shut down Washington D.C. on Sept. 23 2019. Activists demanding a greater global response to climate change disrupted Monday morning commutes with protests in Washington D.C. Ahead of the days United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York activists participated in Shut Down D.C. a coordinated act of civil disobedience designed to draw attention to the global climate crisis. A press release from the events organizers said that Mondays protesters included labor organizations the anti war group Code Pink Black Lives Matter and the environmental justice organization Rising Tide North America. Environmental activists gather in Washington on Monday during global climate action week. The organizers said their goal was to shut down the center of decision making in the U.S. to demand the government immediately ends fossil fuel production and enforces a swift and just transition to renewable energy. Among their demands were the passage of the Green New Deal additional measures to protect indigenous peoples land and a broad push toward climate justice. Pictures and videos posted to social media on Monday morning showed protesters halting traffic at a number of Washington intersections. D.C. police identified 14 locations that were blocked at some point according to The Washington Post.

In a video posted to social media on Monday New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio again directly blamed climate change for 2012's deadySuperstormSandy a contention that lacks scientific support and touted his plan to spend 10billionto fortify and protectLower Manhattan against future storms. Even as local leaders warned that de Blasio's plan to construct new barriers would actually destroy the waterfront neighborhoods he says he wants to protect de Blasio insisted his views were now mainstream among New Yorkers. After Sandy there weren't a lot of climate change deniers left in New York City de Blasio said directly into the camera after reminding viewers that the stormleft dozens dead and cost the city billions in economic losses.We need to protect this city and this country and this world from global warming. There's no national policy to do it right now. ... We have to do it ourselves. Mayor de Blasio added in the video which appeared on Facebook and Twitter that the federal government also must act quickly We have to fight for the bigger changes like the Green New Deal de Blasio said. The mayor claimed that studiesundertaken by his office and others has determined that if the city does not prepare for climate change rising seas will expose 20 percent of lower Manhattan to daily flooding by 2100. However past expert predictions on the effects of global warming have proven inaccurate at best. For exampleUnited Nations scientists predicted that the world had only 10 years to immediately address climate change all the way back in 1989 in order to protect entire cities from destruction and a resulting flood ofeco refugees. ANASA scientist falsely predicted the same thing in 2006. Contrary to de Blasio's assertions no study has defintively linked the existence or power of Superstorm Sandy to man made climate change or made the claim that such a link can be definitively established at all.Some contested studies have however suggested the storm may have become more intense to some degree as a result of warming sea temperatures. We suggest that it is more useful to regard the extreme circulation regime or weather event as being largely unaffected by climate change and question whether known changes in the climate system's thermodynamic state affected the impact of the particular event stated one paper produced by researchers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. The researchers added Some examples briefly illustrated include 'snowmaggedon' in February 2010 Superstorm Sandy in October 2012 and supertyphoon Haiyan in November 2013 and in more detail the Boulder floods of September 2013 all of which were influenced by high sea surface temperatures that had a discernible human component. The Green New Deal backed by de Blasio has not attracted universal support even among Democrats after the resolution'sbotched rollout in Congress earlier this year included the release of an official document by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez's officethat promisedeconomic security even for thoseunwilling to workas well as the elimination offarting cows and air travel. The Democratic mayor on Thursday first announcedhis planto meet the existential threat of climate change specifically by extending a section of the lower Manhattan coastline as much as 500 feet into the East River. He said the 10 billion effort to protect lower Manhattan from flooding by extending the shoreline between the Brooklyn Bridge and the Battery will be funded partly by private development if federal funds are not available. WHAT DOES TRUMP ADMIN'S OWN CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT SAY IS COMING? If there's federal money in play it probably looks one way de Blasio said last week.If there's not federal money in play we have to get some private money into it and there has to be some development. Officials have been developing schemes to fortify New York City's waterfront since Superstorm Sandy destroyed thousands of homes and businesses in 2012. De Blasio said it will cost about 500 million to fortify most of lower Manhattan from future effects of climate change including rising sea levels and intense precipitation with grassy berms and removable barriers. But planners determined that protecting the lowest lying area including South Street Seaport and the financial district will require adding more land over several years. De Blasio who is contemplating joining the crowded field of 2020 Democratic presidential candidates said the 10 billion landfill project should be supported by federal funds but that's unlikely to happen during the administration of Republican President Donald Trump. Lower Manhattan is one of the core centers of the American economy he said. It's where the financial capital of the United States is. The security of lower Manhattan should be a national priority. The fact is it is not. And it's incomprehensible to me that there's no sense of urgency from the federal government. He added We can't afford to bury our head in the sand and that's right now what our federal government is doing. The plan to extend the coastline will go through the city's environmental review process de Blasio said but he hopes to avoid the endless dragging on that usually accompanies something of this scale. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But the prospect of private development on the newly built land is sure to meet resistance from downtown Manhattan community members. City Council member Margaret Chin who represents the area said amore resilient future cannot be paid for by private real estate development that would destroy the waterfront neighborhoods that we are trying to protect. De Blasio announced the climate resilience plan at a news conference after previewing it inNew York magazine. This is the existential threat de Blasio said. This is the core issue we all must face as aggressively as humanly possible. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	False	False	True	True	True
While a sobering new UN report on climate change indicates humans might have little time to change our ways to avoid environmental catastrophe President Trump isnt worried pointing to scientists on both sides of the picture. Referencing an uncle who was a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology whom he never spoke to about climate change as apparent proof of his scientific bona fides Trump told the Associated Press that he has a natural instinct for science and that the climate goes back and forth back and forth. The US president remains unconvinced that human activity is the cause of climate change. While he has backed away from a 2012 claim that the concept was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing noncompetitive he is now convinced that somethings changing and itll change back again according to aninterviewhe gave with 60 Minutes on Sunday. Trumps appointee to the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt notoriously attempted to roll back several key environmental regulations passed under Barack Obama including the Clean Power Plan the Clean Water Rule and a proposed ban on the pesticide chlorpyrifos. Pruitt also oversaw a 23 percent budget cut to the agency and filled science advisory panels with industry representatives instead of unaffiliated scientists. Trump may believe in climate change now but he remains convinced that scientists who see a human role in the process have a very big political agenda. Meanwhile he doesnt want to sacrifice the economic well being of our country for something that nobody really knows. While some Democrats favor bold moves to address climate change others perhaps still shell shocked by the failure of their 2009 cap and trade bill under Obama shy away from anything more than incremental measures citing the hostile political environment in Congress. Rep. Gerry Connolly D VA said Democrats should focus on the practical and the opportunistic in the short term while working toward big picture aspirational goals in the long term. Some might argue the concept of a long term when it comes to the environment was rendered irrelevant by the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. It projected that humans have until 2030 to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions if we want to avoid catastrophic climate change in the form of massive sea level rise increased drought permafrost melt and coral reef die offs.

The much maligned rat is not a creature many would associate with coral reefs. But scientists studying reefs on tropical islands say the animals directly threaten the survival of these ecosystems. A team working on the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean found that invasive rats on the islands are a big problem for coral reefs. Rats decimate seabird populations in turn decimating the volume of bird droppings a natural coral fertiliser. The findings are published in Nature. Scientists now advocate eradicating rats from all of the islands to protect these delicate marine habitats. The Chagos Archipelago provided a large scale natural laboratory to answer this question although the islands are uninhabited by humans some of them are now home to invasive rats brought by ships and shipwrecks. Other islands have remained rat free. The islands with and without rats are like chalk and cheese said Prof Nick Graham from Lancaster University. The islands with no rats are full of birds they're noisy the sky is full and they smell because the guano the birds are depositing back on the island is very pungent. If you step onto an island with rats there's next to no seabirds. By killing seabirds this study revealed rats disrupt a healthy ecosystem that depends on the seabird droppings which fertilise the reefs surrounding the island. On rat free islands seabirds including boobies frigatebirds noddies shearwaters and terns travel hundreds of kilometres to feed out in the ocean. When they return to the island they deposit rich nutrients from the fish they feed on. These nutrients are leaching out onto the reef explained Prof Graham. He and his team were able to track the source of those nutrients back to the fish that seabirds fed on by analysing algae and sponges growing on the reef. We also found that fish on the reefs adjacent to islands with seabirds were growing faster and were larger for their age than the fish on reefs next to rat infested islands Prof Graham explained. There were also significantly more fish on rat free reefs than on those around ratty islands. Coral reefs cover less than 0.1 of the ocean's area but house about one third of ocean biodiversity. Coral reefs are also hugely threatened said Prof Graham. So anyone who cares about extinctions and biodiversity needs to care about the future of coral reefs. The reefs and their abundance of marine life provide livelihoods for millions of people around the world so the decline in coral reefs is poised to become a humanitarian crisis. This team of researchers advocates rat eradication projects on islands throughout the world. Coral reef systems are at crisis point because of climate change said Prof Graham. And we're desperately trying to find ways to enhance the resilience of coral reefs and allow them to cope with climate change. This is one of the clearest examples so far where eradicating rats will lead to increased numbers of seabirds and this will bolster the coral reef.	True	False	False	True	False
GUILLERMO ARIAS via Getty Images A child in the caravan of roughly 7200 Central American migrants headed north to the U.S. Mexico border. Now with the White House poised to gut the federal governments only two major rules to reduce planet warming emissions and Trumpthreatening to cut aid to drought and violence afflicted Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador critics say the administrations strategy to deal with climate change is taking shape frustrating national security experts who say hunkering down and militarizing borders will do little to mitigate global warmings threats. A quasi fascist policy of fear mongering about immigration and corresponding militarization of the border is clearly the major thrust of Trumps response to the mounting impacts of climate chaos said Ashley Dawson author ofExtreme Cities The Peril and Promise of Urban Life in the Age of Climate Change. Despite the repeated dismissals of climate science by the president and many of his top advisers the Trump administration officially forecasts that the planet is expected to warm by 7 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century a projection buried in a 500 page environmental impact statement in August. Thats roughly double the temperature scientists say will cause cataclysmic drought storms and sea level rise and roughly four times the warming the planet has already experienced since the pre industrial era. Under those conditions more than 1 billion people globally could be forced to flee their homes by 2050 and2 billion by 2100. Tropical regions where many of the roughly20000 to 40000 migrants who crossed the U.S. southern border each month in the past year came from are expected to be hit the hardest. Its difficult to draw a direct line between climate change and a migrants decision to leave home and neither the United Nations nor nearly any other major countries currently offer legal avenues for asylum seekers fleeing the effects of global warming. New Zealandbecame the first country late last year to create a special status for climate refugees with 100 annual visas as low lying island nations in its corner of the Pacific face existential threat of sea level rise. On the opposite side of the ocean a hotter climate is expected to parch once fertile lands. In an email Jennifer Francis a Rutgers University climate researcher said its likely that increasing drought in Central America is making it more difficult for farmers there to make a living. The President had willing partners in Congress and could have worked on immigration border security DREAMers and all that Joseph Majkut director of climate policy at the Niskanen Center a libertarian think tank said in an email. But he didnt take advantage of that opportunity. Having missed the chance to seek actual reforms we now get a militaristic and hasty response to a predictable stress. Climate change is contributing to make nations unstable both nations in our neighborhood and others abroad said Femia whose Washington based policy institute includes former top national security advisers. The best way from a security perspective is to bolster the resilience of those countries so you reduce the likelihood of instability reduce the likelihood of conflict and reduce the likelihood of displacement that might force outward migration. That doesnt seem likely in the near term. The president attempted to cut funding forUnited States Agency for International Development by 33 percent this year though bipartisan support for the federal governments dedicated aid agency staved off the proposal. By deporting hundreds of thousands of Central Americans from the United States the administration like the Obama administration before it is bolstering gang recruitment in countries like El Salvador according to a December report from the International Crisis Group. That worsens the violence that many cite as a main reason for fleeing northward.	False	True	False	False	False
Newly released emails show senior Environmental Protection Agency officials working closely with a conservative group that dismisses climate change to rally like minded people for public hearings on science and global warming counter negative news coverage and promote Administrator Scott Pruitt's stewardship of the agency. John Konkus EPA's deputy associate administrator for public affairs repeatedly reached out to senior staffers at the Heartland Institute according to the emails. If you send a list we will make sure an invitation is sent Konkus wrote to then Heartland president Joseph Bast in May 2017 seeking suggestions on scientists and economists the EPA could invite to an annual EPA public hearing on the agency's science standards. Follow up emails show Konkus and the Heartland Institute mustering scores of potential invitees known for rejecting scientific warnings of man made climate change including from groups like Plants Need CO2 The Right Climate Stuff and Junk Science. The emails underscore how Pruitt and senior agency officials have sought to surround themselves with people who share their vision of curbing environmental regulation and enforcement leading to complaints from environmentalists that he is ignoring the conclusions of the majority of scientists in and out of his agency especially when it comes to climate changing carbon emissions. They were obtained by the Environmental Defense Fund and the Southern Environmental Law Center which sued to enforce a Freedom of Information Act request and provided them to The Associated Press. The EPA maintains close working relationships with a broad range of public and private groups and Heartland is just one of many the agency engages with to ensure the public is informed said EPA spokesman Lincoln Ferguson. It demonstrates the agency's dedication to advancing President Trump's agenda of environmental stewardship and regulatory certainty he said. The public hearing referred to in the May 2017 email ultimately was canceled when the EPA official who runs it fell ill the EPA said. But Bast contended in an email sent to EPA staffers and others that the official called off the hearing after learning that climate change skeptics planned to attend. The Heartland Institute calls itself a leading free market think tank. It rejects decades of science saying fossil fuel emissions are altering the climate and says on its website that curbing use of petroleum and coal to fight climate change would squander one of America's greatest comparative advantages among the world's nations. Of course The Heartland Institute has been working with EPA on policy and personnel decisions Tim Huelskamp a former Republican congressman from Kansas who now leads the group said in a statement to the AP. They recognized us as the pre eminent organization opposing the radical climate alarmism agenda and instead promoting sound science and policy Huelskamp wrote. He said Heartland would continue to help Pruitt and his staff. Ferguson said Pruitt and his top officials have also met with groups known for their campaigns against climate changing emissions and pollutants from fossil fuels including the Moms Clean Air Force the American Lung Association and others. But Ben Levitan of the Environmental Defense Fund said mainstream climate change groups have received nothing like the outreach and invitations that Heartland and other hard right groups have been getting. Certainly in some ways this is normal and in the course of business that ebbs and flows with the ideology of the administration in power said Meredith McGehee executive director of Issue One a non profit promoting ethical government and bipartisan political reform. Heartland is not registered as a lobbying group. Spokesman Jim Lakely said the group has logged its contacts with EPA and that they fall below the level required for disclosing as lobbying. An email last February shows Bast forwarded to followers an email with the line From the White House rallying activists to public hearings the EPA was then holding around the country on repealing an Obama era power plan meant to curb fossil fuel emissions. The email is signed by a Pruitt political appointee and gives the name of another EPA official for activists to call. It's not clear from the email however who initiated the attempt to rally conservatives for the public hearing. Konkus was a Republican political consultant when Pruitt named him to the agency. His duties include reviewing awards of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants. The Washington Post reported in September that Konkus had been scrutinizing grant applications for mentions of climate change which he reportedly calls the double C word. Emails show he and former EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman repeatedly reached out to Heartland to talk over critical coverage by the Post. Lakely the Heartland spokesman responds he's shared the article with colleagues asking them to jump to your aide sic and defend this position. Konkus also contacted Heartland and other conservative groups asking for what he calls echo amplifying word of Pruitt's regulation cutting efforts according to the emails. And an email from Bast shared with EPA staffers and others shows the then Heartland president celebrating news that a reporter Justin Gillis was leaving The New York Times. Ding Dong the Witch is Dead. Still waiting for Chris Mooney and Juliet Eilperin at the WaPo and Seth Borenstein at AP to flame out Bast writes. Spokespeople for the AP The Washington Post and The New York Times declined comment.	False	True	False	True	False
The American political conversation about climate is indeed scary and depressing. But the decarbonization of the real U.S. economy as opposed to the cardboard fossil fuel handicapped White House version continues. Indeed decarbonization is accelerating giving me confidence that in a year or so it will be clear to everyone that the U.S. is on track to meet and perhaps exceed its inadequate 2025 Paris objective cutting emissions 26 28 percent. That goal requires reducing emissions by 1800 million tons of CO2.At the end of 2016 the U.S. was almost halfway emissions down 850 million tons or 13 percent.This progress was led by the utility sector where efficiency renewables and natural were replacing coal so fast that power sector carbon was down 25 percent. The world rightfully worries when they hear Donald Trump proclaim he is going to bring back coal and watch the administration and the Republican Congress try to roll back such common sense requirements limits on the wasteful flaring and leaking of methane from oil and gas fields. But Trumps promise to have America withdraw from the Paris climate agreement has sparked a stunning wave of climate leadership from U.S. cities states and businesses a wave that is still building but by the time it crests may more than make up for Trumps stubborn foot dragging. Lets begin with bringing back coal. Since Trump was elected no new coal plants have been announced or opened 10 plants with 5600 megawatts instead have announced they will shut down. West Virginias largest utility wont expand coal generation because it cant find customers for coal power CSX a leading coal hauling railroad thinks coal is going away so fast that it has stopped replacing coal rail cars.Nowthe Sierra Club has estimated that additional coal plants whose retirement have already been announced would cut emissions about 160 million tons. Closing vulnerable plants facilities that no longer make economic sense to keep operating could avoid another 275 million tons. If present trends continue the club also documented that the U.S. could triple renewable electricity overall the utility sector should be emitting 500 million tons of carbon less in 2025 than it was just last year. While coal fades state governments representing almost 60 percentof the American economy are racing forward.In January California released its plan to cut its emissions by 40 percent by 2030 and went on to extend its cap and trade program for another decade until 2030 this time with support for the first time from the oil industry! California is also on the verge of requiring 100 percent of its power to come from renewables. Overall a dozen states are debating increasing their reliance on renewable power.Maryland just established a 25 percent renewable power goal overriding the veto of a Republican governor. The Nevada legislature went for 40 percent but has not yet been able to overturn a similar veto. The 15early adaptor states in the Climate Alliance will report this week that they are already on track to reduce their 2025 emissions by 24 29 percent. And some of Americas most Republican climate skeptical states Oklahoma Kansas North Dakota and even Texas are steadily replacing coal with renewables for economic reasons. These dont usually get counted in reporting on bottom up climate action but they have a huge positive impact on emissions. Whether their state legislatures and governors are leading on climate or not Americas cities where most of our climate pollution originates are embracing a decarbonized future.In June when Trump promised to pull out of the Paris agreement 125 cities told the world we are still in the Paris agreement.Today only three months later the number has ballooned to 238. The U.S. Conference of Mayors representing more than 1000 of Americas largest cities voted unanimously to endorse the goal of 100 percent renewable power and since Trumps election the number of U.S. cities with 100 percent policies has mushroomed more than 40 cities are now committed individually and five have hit that target! But government is not alone.The private sector where companies are increasingly competing with each other to succeed in the carbon free economy of the future is making Trumps climate denial braggadocio increasingly irrelevant. The Mars Candy Company recently committed a billion dollars to ensure that its operations and supply chain would reduce their climate impact by 67 percent by 2050. The number of companies who have signed the pledge of support for the Paris agreement has almost doubled from 906 in June to 1729 this week. And global firms will impact the U.S. climate footprint. VW announced a few days ago that it will offer electric versions of all its models entering the competition against current global EV leader U.S. based Tesla which delivered its first Model 3 in July. It is true the Trump administration is struggling to hold back the future with appalling decisions like EPAs recent announcement that it would delay cleaning up toxic water pollution from coal power plants for two years.But the courts are steadily shredding much of this the conservative 10th circuit just ruled that Trump must consider climate impacts before issuing new coal leases on federal lands. As the CEO of one of Americas historically coal dependent utilities Tom Fanning of the Southern Company says You cant keep waves off the beach.King Canute knew this. And the decarbonization of the American economy the real economy not the fake news economy shows its still true.The world can see and measure America is still in.	False	True	False	True	False
The internal combustion engines days may be numbered in California where officials are mulling whether a ban on sales of polluting autos is needed to achieve long term targets for cleaner air. Governor Jerry Brown has expressed an interest in barring the sale of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines Mary Nichols chairman of the California Air Resources Board said in an interview Friday at Bloomberg headquarters in New York.The earliest such a ban is at least a decade away she said. Brown one of the most outspoken elected official in the U.S. about the need for policies to combat climate change would be replicating similar moves by China France and the U.K. Ive gotten messages from the governor asking Why havent we done something already? Nichols said referring to Chinas planned phase out of fossil fuel vehicle sales. The governor has certainly indicated an interest in why China can do this and not California. Embracing such a policy would send shockwaves through the global car industry due to the heft of Californias auto market. More than 2 million new passenger vehicles were registered in the state last year topping France Italy or Spain. If a ban were implemented automakersfrom General Motors Co. to Toyota Motor Corp. would be under new pressure to make electric vehicles the standard for personal transportation in the most populous U.S. state casting fresh doubts on the future of gasoline and diesel powered autos elsewhere. The Association of Global Automakers said consumers must be able to afford the cleaner cars that California says are needed to meet its climate goals. The trade association represents Toyota Honda Motor Co. and other overseas carmakers in the U.S. We have been working with California on intelligent market based approaches to emissions reductions beyond 2025 and we hope that this doesnt signal an abandonment of that position Global Automakers Chief Executive Officer John Bozzella said in a statement. California has set a goal to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050. Rising emissions from on road transportation has undercut the states efforts to reduce pollutionaccording to Next 10 San Francisco based non profit. To reach the ambitious levels of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions we have to pretty much replace all combustion with some form of renewable energy by 2040 or 2050 Nichols said. Were looking at that as a method of moving this discussion forward. California has the authority to write its own pollution rules which dates back to the 1970 Clean Air Act. Those rules are underpinned by waivers granted by the Environmental Protection Agency. Nichols said the state would likely take a different legal route to enable a possible ban rather than use an EPA waiver since the Trump administration would be unlikely to approve one. For example California could use vehicle registration rules or control the vehicles that can access state highways she said. We certainly wouldnt expect to get a waiver for that from EPA Nichols said. I think we would be looking at using some of our other authorities to get to that result. Read more California Sets Demands for Auto Emission Talks With Trump China will likely order an end to sales of all polluting vehicles by 2030 the chairman of electric carmaker BYD Co. said Thursday. France and the U.K. have announced 2040 as their end date for sales of fossil fuel powered cars. A ban for California could also still be decades away from implementation and just how far out remains to be seen Nichols said. There are people who believe including who work for me that you could stop all sales of new internal combustion cars by 2030. Some people say 2035 some people say 2040 she said. Its awfully hard to predict any of that with precision but it doesnt appear to be out of the question.	False	False	False	True	False
BERLIN Green parties in Germany France Britain and elsewhere celebrated big gains in elections for the 751 seat European Parliament amid growing voter concerns over climate change expressed in large scale student protests over recent months. Provisional results Monday showed the left leaning Greens bloc coming fourth in the election with 69 seats an increase of 17 compared with 2014. If confirmed the results could put the Greens in a position to tip the scales when it comes to choosing the next head of the European Commission. The rise of the Greens with their distinctly pro European Union stance marks a counterpoint to that of the far right anti migrant parties that have been growing in popularity across Europe in recent years. Whoever wants legitimacy from us and the legitimacy of the many who went onto the streets will need to deliver now said Sven Giegold a leading candidate for the German Green party that scooped up more than 20 of the vote nationwide an increase of almost 10 compared with 2014. READ MORE Europes voters elect new parliament as nationalism mounts voters elect new parliament as nationalism mounts The drift from the traditional heavyweight parties to the Greens in Germany was particularly pronounced in large cities such as Berlin Munich and Hamburg and among young voters where the party beat its bigger rivals among all voters under 60 according to the Infratest dimap research institute. Armin Laschet the governor of Germanys most populous state North Rhine Westphalia and a member of Chancellor Angela Merkels center right Union bloc called the outcome a wake up call for politics. In neighboring France 25 of voters aged 18 25 voted for the Greens compared with 15 for the far right National Rally and 12 for President Emmanuel Macrons Republic on the Move according to the Ifop polling organization. Overall the French green party EELV received almost 13.5 of the vote coming third. Yannick Jadot lead candidate of EELV welcomed the great green wave in Europe. The French sent us a very clear message they want environment to be at the heart of our lives at the heart of the political game and that message has been spread across Europe he said. The very good score of the greens in Germany Luxembourg Belgium and France sends a signal that the center of gravity of the European politics is shifting that in addition to the populists and the pro business parties there are the Greens Jadot said. Green parties also polled strongly in Austria Sweden Ireland Denmark and the Netherlands. In Britain the Greens a largely insignificant force nationally took 11 seats in the European Parliament vote. This was kind of a vote for all europhile and pro integration positions the Greens have championed Martin Florack a political scientist at the University of Duisburg Essen told German public broadcaster ARD. The enmity was reflected in comments by Alexander Gauland the co leader of the far right Alternative for Germany party who declared the Greens our main enemy on Monday. The Greens will destroy this country and our job must and will be to fight the Greens said Gauland whose party has claimed climate change isnt a man made phenomenon but instead caused by factors such as solar activity a theory most scientists dismiss. A senior member of the anti immigration and euroskeptic Danish Peoples Party Kenneth Kristensen Berth said the issues of the climate and the environment were a bit hysterical during the election but insisted that Denmarks second largest political group is not a climate denial party. Among those celebrating the Greens rise was Biggi Tran a 26 year old in Berlin. She attributed the result to young peoples fears about global warming. The climate issue is super important at the moment Tran said. Manuel Rivera a Green party member in the Germany capital said the European Parliament was the right place to tackle climate change. I think people realize that there are issues you cant solve at the national level he said. Giegold the German Greens lead candidate said voters expect the party to deliver on its environmental pledges not secure powerful posts in the executive European Commission. Across Europe this was a vote to protect the climate he said. People didnt take to the streets to elect or kick out a party but for these problems to be solved. Green lawmakers in the European Parliament plan to scrutinize the blocs 200 billion euro 223.7 billion agriculture budget which environmentalists say places too much emphasis on large scale farming and not enough on eco friendly agriculture he said. The Greens also want every law passed at the EU level to undergo a climate check. The party has strongly backed scientists calls for the bloc to end all greenhouse gas emissions by mid century. Achieving this goal would require a drastic shift in Europes economy away from fossil fuels to clean energy and low carbon lifestyles. Some measures proposed for cutting emissions have already faced strong headwind including Macrons plan for a fuel tax hike in France that triggered protests from workers even as environmentalists accused the president of not doing enough for the climate. Sylvie Corbet in Paris and Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin contributed to this report. 	False	False	False	False	False
The head of the Environmental Protection Agency has said America has nothing to apologise for on climate change and retains a seat at the negotiating table claiming After all were the United States. Scott Pruitt joined other officials in declining to say whether Donald Trump believes human activity contributes to climate change a day after the president pulled America out of the landmark Paris agreement. Pruitt claimed Trump wants better terms within the Paris framework or an entirely new deal and dismissed warnings from world leaders that it is not negotiable. Well thats up to them right? the EPA administrator told reporters. The United States has a seat at the table. After all were the United States and we are leading with respect to CO2 reduction. We have made tremendous progress. If nations around the globe want to seek to learn from us on what were doing to reduce our CO2 footprint were going to share that with them and thats something that should occur and will occur in the future. We will reach out and reciprocate with nations that seek to achieve that. Trump announced on Thursday that the US the worlds second biggest greenhouse gas emitter would immediately stop implementing the 195 nation agreement brokered by Barack Obama in 2015. There was a global backlash and the EU said on Friday it will increase cooperation with China to combat climate change. Pruitt denied that America has abandoned the victims of climate change around the world arguing that it has done a tremendous amount to reduce carbon output to 1990s levels and will stay engaged and continue to export relevant technology. This is not a message to anyone in the world that America should be apologetic of its CO2 position. Were actually making tremendous advances. Were just not going to agree to frameworks and agreements that put us at an economic disadvantage and hurt citizens across this country. He echoed Trumps attack on members of the agreement as having economic rather than environmental motives. The world applauded when we joined Paris and you know why? I think they applauded because they knew it was going to put this country at an economic disadvantage and the reason European leaders want us to stay in is because they know it will continue to shackle our economy though we are leading the world with respect to our CO2 reduction. The EPA administrator was asked repeatedly whether Trump believes climate change is a hoax as Trump previously claimed but refused to give a straight answer. Theres enough to deal with with respect to the Paris agreement and making an informed decision about this important issue he said. Thats where our focus has been the last several weeks. For his own part Pruitt acknowledged that global warming is occurring and that human activity contributes to it in some manner. But he added Measuring with precision from my perspective the degree of human contribution is very challenging. Sean Spicer the White House press secretary was similarly evasive on the topic. Asked if he can talk to Trump about the cause of climate change and report back at the next press briefing he replied If I can I will. Spicer gave short shrift to suggestions that Trumps decision will lift China as a global leader. I think part of the reason the president said it was a bad deal yesterday was because countries including China were not making substantial progress in reducing their carbon footprint. They werent doing enough and America was carrying the load so I think by negotiating a better deal hopefully we can get a better result for our country and the world. Nicaragua and Syria are the only countries not party to the Paris accord the former says it is not ambitious enough. Under a long exit process Americas withdrawal will not be become formal until November 2020.	True	True	False	True	True
President Donald Trump has announced that the US is withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate agreement. He said moves to negotiate a new fair deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers would begin. Mr Trump said during last year's presidential election campaign that he would take the step to help his country's oil and coal industries. Opponents say withdrawing from the accord is an abdication of US leadership on a key global challenge. The Paris agreement commits the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures well below 2C above pre industrial levels and endeavour to limit them even more to 1.5C. Only Syria and Nicaragua did not sign up to the deal. Speaking in the White House Rose Garden Mr Trump characterised the Paris agreement as a deal that aimed to hobble disadvantage and impoverish the US. He claimed the agreement would cost the US 3tn in lost GDP and 6.5 million jobs while rival economies like China and India were treated more favourably. In order to fulfil my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord... but begin negotiations to re enter either the Paris accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States he said. The speech contained several rhetorical flourishes reminiscent of his campaign speeches. We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us any more and they won't be he said. I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh not Paris. I promised I would exit or re negotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests. Many trade deals will soon be under re negotiation. The BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan in Washington says the move will be welcomed by many Trump supporters as for them this is less about science and more about sending a signal to so called global elites. Analysts say the US withdrawal from the Paris agreement will make it more difficult for the world to reach the goals that it set for itself in the Paris agreement. The US contributes about 15 of global emissions of carbon but it is also a significant source of finance and technology for developing countries in their efforts to fight rising temperatures. Mr Trump did not give a timescale for US withdrawal but White House sources had earlier suggested it could take up to four years. Former US President Barack Obama who agreed to the Paris deal immediately criticised the move accusing the Trump administration of rejecting the future. Republican congressional leaders and the US coal industry backed the move with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell supporting Mr Trump for dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama administration's assault on domestic energy production and jobs. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the decision one of the worst policy moves made in the 21st Century because of the huge damage to our economy our environment and our geopolitical standing. The leaders of France Germany and Italy issued a joint statement rejecting a renegotiation of the agreement. We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible and we firmly believe that the Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated since it is a vital instrument for our planet societies and economies it said. This was echoed by UK Prime Minister Theresa May who expressed her disappointment and told Mr Trump in a phone call that the deal protects the prosperity and security of future generations. Leaders of the Nordic nations Sweden Finland Denmark Norway and Iceland also condemned the move. A United Nations spokeswoman said it was a major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security. Small island nations whose existence is threatened by rising sea levels were critical of the move. The President of the Marshall Islands Hilda Heine said it was highly concerning for those of us that live on the frontline of climate change. Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk confirmed that he was leaving his role as an adviser to the Trump administration in protest. Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world he tweeted. President Trump's statement is a very clear repudiation of the Paris agreement and international efforts to fund climate mitigation and adaptation in poorer countries. In many ways it is far worse than many had expected. He sees it as a clear job killer as an economy strangler and a desperately unfair stitch up by other countries wanting to take economic advantage of the US. He spoke of being open to re negotiating the deal or trying to build a new agreement but the idea of re negotiation is an unlikely scenario. The scale of his opposition seeing the deal as a massive redistribution of US wealth to other countries is a clear indication that he has fully bought into an economic nationalist and climate denier perspective. The question of unfairness cropped up again and again how the world's worst polluters China and India had no meaningful obligations placed on them by the deal. The overall tone and content of his speech clearly plays to his base but is also a clear disavowal of multilateralism especially on climate change and will definitely push other countries more closely together on this issue. Climate change or global warming refers to the damaging effect of gases or emissions released from industry and agriculture on the atmosphere. The Paris accord is meant to limit the global rise in temperature attributed to emissions.	True	False	False	True	False
Thecreationof the DMZ in 1953 marked a ceasefire in a war that divided Korea and resulted in the deaths of 2.5 million people including more than 36000 American soldiers. With the exception of Panmunjom a small village where peace negotiations were held and is still the site of some diplomatic engagements people are not allowed in the DMZ. Over 60 years have passed since the creation of the DMZ. In that time the inaccessible land between the barbed wire fences has turned into a land of pristine nature and life. It has become a refuge for venous wild flora and fauna with over 106 endangered species including the musk deer mountain goat otter golden eagle mute swan bean good common Korean battering Mongolian racerunner Korean necklace pod and the vesper iris. The DMZ is also a sanctuary for migratory birds visited by rare and wild bird species from all over the world in early October. Smithsonian Magazine reported that before the Korean War much of the wetlands area of the DMZ was cultivated farmland. The Seoul based newspaper the Dong A Ilbo reportedThursday that some experts think the DMZ should be designated a UNESCO biosphere preserved through international support. The World Heritage Committee ambassadors at UNESCO have praised DMZ as a wonderfully preserved natural heritage with potential to be registered as a natural reserve immediately Korean Ambassador to UNESCO Lee Byung hun told the Dong A Ilbo. South Korea applied for registry in 2012 but was thwarted by North Korean opposition according to the Dong A Ilbo. The DMZ is not only home to various wildlife but also to wetlands Kim Kwi gon professor emeritus at Seoul National University told the outlet. The region should be classified according to value such as key areas with high preservation value and buffer areas. Other areas could be designated for economic cooperation and travel. Dong A Ilbo reported that the National Institute of Ecology NIE affiliated by the Ministry of Environment announced on Wednesday that 37.8 percent of the 267 endangered species in Korea are living in the DMZ. The NIE regularly updates Koreans about the state of nature in the DMZ through videos it posts on its social media accounts. The data collected in the DMZ took place from 2014 to 2017. Previous data has been collected starting in 1974.	True	True	False	False	True
Buildings disappear in the smog in Ulaanbaatar where residents have resorted to sipping 'lung' tea and 'oxygen cocktails' in a desperate bid to protect themselves from pollution Fed up with the smog in Mongolia's capital residents have resorted to sipping lung tea and oxygen cocktails in a desperate bid to protect themselves from pollution despite health officials saying there is no evidence they work. Ulaanbaatar topped New Delhi and Beijing as the world's most polluted capital in 2016 UNICEF said in a report warning of a health crisis that has put every child and pregnancy at risk. With residents of so called ger slum districts using coal stoves to cook and heat their homes in the world's coldest capital where temperatures can dip as low as 40 Celsius 40 Fahrenheit pollution has skyrocketed. While most of the pollution comes from stoves in the gers road transport and power plants add to the toxic mix. On January 30 air pollution was 133 times higher than the safe limit set by the World Health Organization WHO. UNICEF reported that cases of respiratory infections have nearly tripled and pneumonia is now the second leading cause of death for children under five. Worried parents have held protests to press the government to take action. But some businesses are cashing in even though a WHO official says there is no evidence that such anti smog products work. Batbayariin Munguntuul sitting with her children while an air purifier runs at her home in Ulaanbaatar Advertisements in Mongolia boast that drinking just one oxygen cocktail is equal to a three hour walk in a lush forest. At the produce section of the State Department Store blue cans of oxygen called Life Is Air are on sale for 2 and promise to turn a glass of juice into a foamy sweet oxygen cocktail after spraying some into a glass through a special straw. Other stores and pharmacies have oxygen cocktail machines that resemble coffee makers and can turn a juice into a frothy drink for 1. Pregnant women are among the most avid customers of the Russian made product with some saying they are following their doctor's orders. Batbayar Munguntuul a 34 year old accountant and mother of three drank oxygen cocktails when she was pregnant but she ended up spending much more money on medicine. Every winter we constantly buy medicine she told AFP. It has reached a point that it is like just any other grocery product that you have to buy regularly. Like many other Mongolians she has chosen to buy an air purifier to make sure her family breathes clean air at home. Her machine which filters out toxic fumes cost her 300. The average level of PM2.5 particles which penetrate deep into the lungs was 75 micrograms per cubic metre last year or three times the exposure recommended by the WHO for a 24 hour period. Air pollution has been linked to asthma bronchitis and other long term respiratory diseases. Some Mongolians drinking special teas named Enkhjin Ikh Taiga and Dr. Baatar that claim to clean lungs. Dr. Baatar's CEO Baatar Chantsaldulam said sales surge by 20 to 30 percent during winter when pollution tends to reach its peak. First it takes all the toxins out of the blood then it turns the toxins in the lung into mucus and all the plants in tea helps boost the human immune system he told AFP. But Maria Neira the head of the WHO's public health department said the real solution to protect the lungs and the cardiovascular system was to reduce air pollution and avoid exposure to it. The business community will offer plenty of those solutions Neira said referring to the oxygen cocktails and lung teas. We don't have any scientific evidence whether they provide any benefit she said. For the past 10 years people have known that air pollution has reached dangerous levels Parents Against Smog coordinator Tumur Mandakhjargal told AFP. However policymakers only address the issue by talking about passing out clean stoves and clean coal Mandakhjargal said. The NGO says the government should give some 200000 ger residents access to loans so that they install heating insulation and replace their stoves with cleaner heaters. It also complains that a ger relocation plan has been too slow. The government spent 120 million between 2008 2016 to combat pollution with half of the funds coming out of its foreign aid revenue. Part of the money has gone to distributing low emission stoves to residents of ger districts. Last year the parliament approved a tax exemption for companies that sell air purifiers while Prime Minister Ukhnaa Khurelsukh issued an order to distribute 1.6 million worth of the appliances to all schools. Non profit organisations are giving away air purifiers and anti smog masks to schools kindergartens and hospitals. The non profit group Smog and Kids donated a South Korean made air ventilation system to a kindergarten in one of the capital's most polluted areas and the difference in air quality inside and outside the classrooms is palpable. Such systems can cost up to 2500 plus 500 for installation. But Smog and Kids representative Tumendalai Davaadalai said air purifiers were not the answer to the problem. Mobile air purifiers don't give oxygen they're not plants. The decision by Khurelsukh's cabinet to distribute air purifiers is a very bad decision Davaadalai said. They are just funding businesses without any positive results.	True	False	False	False	False
President Donald Trump is making good on his campaign promise to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement a move thats been called a moral disgrace and thats expected to hinder much needed progress in the fight against global warming. A failure to tackle climate change will mean more extreme weather dirtier air and water and more food shortages. Itll also mean more disease. Researchers have long been arguing that the effects of climate change could undermine the last 50 years of gains in global health increasing the spread of infections like yellow fever and chronic diseases like asthma and heart disease. Now is not the time to be scaling back efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The December 2015 agreement which has been signed by nearly 200 countries aimed to cut greenhouse gas emissions and keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. The US had committed to cutting its emissions by up to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. These goals were widely viewed as a win for public health. Americas retreat now could be a major setback. There are a number of ways climate change puts us at a greater risk for disease. Chief among them a warmer planet is one thats more hospitable to disease. Disease carrying vectors like mosquitoes thrive in warm and moist environments. Zika dengue and chikungunya are all spread by the Aedes type mosquito. And one of the reasons researchers think Aedes may be reaching new places and more people lately is climate change. Its not just mosquitoes though Bird flu cholera Lyme disease salmonella researchers believe all are being made worse by climate change. At a February meeting on climate change and health former Vice President Al Gore focused his talk on this problem. Climate change is tilting the balance disrupting natural ecosystems and giving more of an advantage to microbes he said. Changing climate conditions change the areas in which these diseases can take root and become endemic. Read Maryn McKennas New York Times story for more on this. In addition deforestation and urbanization are moving humans into areas where they havent lived before and putting them into closer contact with animals that carry disease causing microbes like bats during West Africas 2014 Ebola outbreak. Brian Deese a senior adviser to President Barack Obama overseeing climate change and energy policy and former Ebola czar Ron Klain explained why in a piece at the Washington Post Climate change destroys habitats and stresses animal populations such as the bats of West Africa forcing them to hunt for food nearer to humans. Humans likewise pressed by climate impacts encroach more closely on animal habitats. While we cannot know that climate change was the cause of the specific interaction between bats and humans that is believed to have launched the Ebola outbreak in Guinea we will see more of these interactions in the future and more epidemics as a result. Ebola demonstrates that even localized dislocation of people and animals can create global risk. Climate change is a threat multiplier for much broader dislocation accelerating the complex factors that drive people from their homes. Greenhouse gases are not only harmful to the environment they also increase the risk of everything from asthma to heart disease. According to the Global Burden of Disease project more than 5 million people die worldwide each year because of air pollution and emissions from coal fired plants are a major risk factor here. Its one reason why health experts have been pushing policymakers to rapidly phase out of coal. For miners the immediate health risks include black lung disease and scarring of the lung tissue. But the pollutants emitted when coal is processed including sulfur dioxide particulate matter nitrogen oxides and mercury have much more far reaching effects on many more people. In one large study involving 450000 Americans followed between 1982 and 2004 researchers found that increased exposure to the particles in fossil fuel emissions increased the risk of death from heart disease and particles from coal burning were five times more damaging than other similar particles. Reducing emissions from coal fired power plants makes it easier to breathe. Over the past 30 years the percentage of Americans with asthma has more than doubled and climate change has been a significant driver of that trend. Air pollution triggers asthma attacks contributing to lung abnormalities particularly in the developing pulmonary systems of children. The Paris agreement was no panacea but it nudged the world in the right direction. Now the US moves backward. Its not just the future of the environment thats at stake here. Our health hangs in the balance too.	True	False	False	True	False
A Tesla Model 3 is touted as a zero emissions car by government regulators but it actually results in more carbon dioxide than a comparable diesel powered car according to a recent study. When the CO2 emissions from battery production is included electric cars like Teslas are in the best case slightly higher than those of a diesel engine and are otherwise much higher reads a release from the German think tank IFO. Its better read as a warning that new technologies arent a climate change panacea. Recall the false promises about corn and cellulosic ethanol The Wall Street Journal editorial board wrote of the study. RELATED 2020 Democrats Back Plan Thats Already Raising Electricity Prices Driving a Tesla Model 3 in Germany for example is responsible for 156 to 181 grams of CO2 per kilometer compared to just 141 grams per kilometer for a diesel powered Mercedes C220d that includes emissions from producing diesel fuel. IFO looked at electric car production in Germany which is heavily reliant on coal power. Electric car emissions in other countries depend on their energy mix but Germany is the worlds third largest electric car maker. China and the U.S. are the first and second largest electric car producers respectively. China gets 65 percent of its electricity from coal power and the U.S. relies on coal for 27 percent of its electric power. China is also the top battery producing country using coal power to produce batteries for electric vehicles that are then subsidized for being zero emissions. California for example requires automakers to cut greenhouse gas emissions in cars by producing lower emissions vehicles or buying credits from companies like Tesla that make electric vehicles. At the federal level the U.S. gives tax breaks of up to 7500 per electric vehicle. Federal subsidies for Teslas are set to be phased out since the company founded by Elon Musk hit the 200000 vehicle production cap. However Congress is debating whether or not to extend electric car subsidies. Its not just battery production but charging vehicles that emit lots of CO2. Germany gets 35 percent of its electricity from coal fired power plants so charging a Tesla in say Bavaria results in 83 grams of CO2 per kilometer driven. Over the long term hydrogen methane technology offers a further advantage it allows surplus wind and solar power generated during peaks to be stored and these surpluses will see a sharp increase as the share of this renewable energy grows study co author Christoph Buchal professor of physics at the University of Cologne said in a statement. IFO isnt the first research group to conclude electric cars might not reduce carbon dioxide emissions as promised. A study released in 2018 also found driving electric cars might come with higher emissions than diesel vehicles largely because of lithium ion battery production. Likewise a Manhattan Institute study from 2018 also found putting more electric cars on the road would likely increase emissions compared to internal combustion engine vehicles.

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke spent the last week targeting environmental groups that have for years opposed activities like logging and thinning to reduce the risks of catastrophic wildfires on federal lands. The former Montana congressman blamed litigation from radical environmentalists who would rather see forests and communities burn than see a logger in the woods in a USA Todayop edpublished Wednesday. Zinke also called out extreme environmentalists in aninterviewwith KCRA that aired Sunday. The day before that Zinke lambasted environmental terrorists groups that have not allowed public access that refuse to allow harvest of timber in aninterviewwith Breitbart Radio. Deadly wildfires have consumed over 1 million acres in West Coast states damaging structures and forcing thousands to flee their homes. The recent death of a firefighter battling the nearly 350000 acre Mendocino Complex Fire brings thedeath tollto six for this season. So whats the point of attacking environmentalists? Zinke is taking the conversation away from global warming and bringing it back to land management including the litigation and environmental laws that keep officials from actively managing the forests. Instead activists focus on global warming arguing human caused warming has expanded wildfire season due to longer hotter drier conditions in the western states. At the same time these groups often oppose efforts to clear forests of debris and dead wood that fuel fires when hot dry weather sets in every year. Ive heard the climate change argument back and forth Zinke told the Sacramento based KCRA. This has nothing to do with climate change. This has to do with active forest management.RELATED Californias Biggest Utility Continues To Blame Global Warming For Wildfires Started By Its Own Power Lines Wildfire experts tend to see land management and urban growth as prime drivers of wildfires. Many experts also see global warming as a factor in the rise of fires but admit the relationship is more complicated than the media lets on. The story cant be a simply that warming is increasing the numbers of wildfires in California because the number of fires is declining. And area burned has not been increasing either University of Washington climate scientist Cliff Masswrotein a recent blog post. In fact the recent National Climate Assessmentspecial reportgave low to medium confidence for a detectable human climate change contribution in the western United States based on existing studies. Most wildfires are caused by humans mostly unintentionally. Sparks from vehicles or equipment power lines arson and cigarettes are some of the ways humans cause massive blazes. Lightning is the cause of wildfires humans dont spark. In California for example humanscaused95 percent of all wildfires with power lines and utility equipment becoming a growing problem. Research also shows that wildfire season has primarily grown from population growth in fire prone areas increasing the chances of a fire causing spark. Environmentalists have obviously not taken kindly to Zinkes remarks but are particularly incensed by his dismissal of global warming as a driver of catastrophic wildfires. Randi Spivak public lands program director at the Center for Biological Diversity said the administration is missing the main issue by being dismissive of climate changes effect on the fires. Climate change creates drought high wind conditions low humidity. Fire creates its own weather Randi Spivak the public lands director at the Center for Biological DiversitytoldThe Hill. You can thin all you want till the cows come home but fire will overtake that Spivak said adding what is misleading is people like Zinke and other people who refuse to talk about climate change and how we need to tackle that. Name calling and finger pointing wont change the truth that climate change is exacerbating wildfiresechoedthe Sierra Clubs Athan Manuel. The long term safety of our communities relies on reducing carbon pollution. Zinke actually did say fire season had gotten longer and temperatures had warmed but added that doesnt relieve you of the responsibility to remove the dead and dying timber and manage our forests so you dont have these catastrophic burns. But Zinke is correct that environmental litigation has kept federal agencies including the Interior Department and U.S. Forest Service from thinning clearing debris and conducting prescribed burns to keep forest growth in check. A 2014studypublished in the Journal of Forestry found vegetative management or logging projects continued to be the dominant type of management activity involved in Forest Service land management litigation representing nearly three times more cases than any other type of management activity. The Forest Service was found more likely to lose cases where plaintiffs advocated for less resource use particularly in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals where the agency won less than half its cases. In fact the 9th Circuit on Mondayoverturneda Forest Service plan for part of Idahos Payette National Forest. The judge sided with environmental groups and ruled renders the Project inconsistent with the desired vegetative conditions set forth in the Payette Forest Plan from 2003. The servicesplanthat got overturned included getting fire conditions toward historical range of variability to reduce wildland fire risk improve wildlife habitat through mechanical thinning harvest and prescribed burning.

Investigators are looking into the Hanford nuclear facility in Washington state after contractors were filmed dumping radiation affected water and later tried to bury the evidence at the site of one of the largest nuclear cleanup efforts in the world. Several videos obtained by Seattles KING TV show workers at the Hanford facilitys Plutonium Finishing Plant PFP dumping liquids from large metal containers that are labeled Caution radioactive materials. In nearly 25 years of working here Ive never seen anything like that a Hanford worker told KING. The workers are employed by Washington River Protection Solutions WRPS the organization responsible for cleaning approximately 53 million gallons of high level radioactive and chemical waste stored in the containers at Hanford. The facility dates back to the Manhattan Project in the 1940s. For decades it produced the majority of the plutonium for the US nuclear weapons arsenal. In 1988 production stopped and the site became a burying ground for radioactive waste. Hanford has since become the most contaminated spot in the Western Hemisphere prompting a multi billion dollar clean up process that isnt expected to be completed until 2060. The soils under Hanford are extensively contaminated over a broad broad area. The one thing you dont want to do is create more waste sites said Dirk Dunning a chemical engineer and Hanford expert. WRPS told state investigators that workers dumped around 15 gallons of potentially toxic water on August 15 and 200 gallons on August 17 according to a document from the Department of Ecology. Washington law makes it a gross misdemeanor to discharge pollutants into the water or soil. The company was also required to report any discharge of toxic waste to the Department of Ecology within 24 hours. However WRPS did not report the discharges for nearly a month and a notification from the Department of Ecology shows the company only made the report days after KING emailed WRPS federal and state officials and the Environmental Crimes Unit of the state Office of the Attorney General about the incident. They knew it was wrong to dump the liquids but they did it anyway. They were hoping no one would question it. They definitely knew it should have been reported a WRPS employee said. WRPS had been tasked with digging up 18 underground nuclear waste hoses and putting them in containers which would then be buried in a nuclear waste dump at the facility. When workers found one of their containers filled with rainwater they decided to dump it onto the ground rather than testing the water or transferring it to new containers. A contract shows the company would earn 58333 for each hose that was removed for a total of more than 1 million dollars if they finished the project by September 30. WRPS dumped the toxic liquid in order to meet their deadline said Tom Carpenter executive director at Hanford Challenge a watchdog organization working to keep contractors working at the facility accountable. They are here for the money and thats it Carpenter told KING. This fee structure ignores human nature which is to take shortcuts to get the money without any accountability unless they get caught. The Department of Ecology has launched an investigation and has already been to the site to take soil samples to check for chemicals such as arsenic lead and fluorene at the first dumping site. However after WRPS did a radiological survey and identified beta and gamma radioactive contamination they removed the contaminated soil and surrounding debris which can no longer be tested by investigators. The disposal of radioactive waste at Hanford has been plagued with problems. RT visited the site last year after workers were evacuated from the facility due to a leak of thousands of gallons of toxic waste. Locals said that the site occasionally burps radiation which has led to a number of employees developing serious medical conditions over the years. In August the company tested more than 300 workers and found 20 percent tested positive for radiation contamination. The Department of Energy estimates that 444 billion gallons of radioactive material and chemical waste were discharged onto the grounds of the facility and into the Columbia River in the first 50 years since the facility opened. Dumping at the site without a permit became illegal after the nonprofit advocacy group Heart of America Northwest sued the Department of Energy in 1993. After seeing the recent footage of workers dumping the toxic waste at the site state Representative Gerry Pollet who also serves as the executive director of Heart of America Northwest called their actions outrageous. This is the kind of thing that caused Hanford to be the most contaminated place in the Western Hemisphere in the first place. I am shocked to see something like this in 2017 Pollet said. Its a crime. Im convinced by looking at this that youre witnessing a criminal violation of several statues not just one.	True	True	False	False	True
A mid spring snowstorm in Colorado over the weekend postponed a rally that sought to bring attention climate change and global warming as well as protest President Donald Trumps climate policies. A march slated to take place in Colorado Springs on Saturday had to be cancelled after weather forecasters predicted heavy snowfall and blizzard like conditions. Only a few inches of snow fell in the Colorado Springs area but more than a foot of snow fell on other parts of the state. Sometimes Mother Nature throws you a curveball! We know we arent in the business of risking anyones safety. Dangerous conditions and wet heavy snow in the forecast for tomorrow a local climate change organization wrote on their Facebook page. The rally and march was rescheduled for Sunday afternoon. The freezing weather and snow however was unable to postpone a similar rally in Denver where pictures of a snowman at the global warming rally made rounds on Twitter. As well as an ironic sign In other parts of the country where similar marches and rallies took place the weather was a little kinder to the liberal climate alarmist narrative. In Washington D.C. the temperature was in the upper 80s to near 90 as people gathered to protest Trumps climate policies. The Peoples Climate March which was supported by hundreds of thousands across the country and tens of thousands in Washington was sponsored by environmental groups labor unions and social justice groups. Video showed thousands marching in the streets of Washington where former Vice President Al Gore Hollywood superstar Leonardo DiCaprio and Virgin Atlantic owner Richard Branson showed up to protest as well. This weekends protests come one week after last weeks March for Science.	True	False	False	True	True
Britishtaxpayers face paying more to help developing countries tackle climate change after Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris agreement left a 2.3billion black hole. The US President pulled the plug on billions of dollars his country pledged as part of a 78billion international commitment to help poor countries switch to renewable energy. And now other rich nations including the UK could be called on to cover the cost. International Development Secretary Priti Patel yesterday indicated she would be reluctant to plug the financial gap left by Mr Trump's decision to pull out. She stressed the importance of the fund in heading off wider humanitarian crises such as droughts and floods and said leaders should focus on cutting waste from the programme rather than pumping in more cash immediately. Asked whether the UK could contribute more she told the Daily Mail 'It is not always about money it is about ways of working and how to achieve effective outcomes. 'I think we can work more effectively in making sure that every pound that goes in to the fund is achieving what it is meant to do.' Mr Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris agreement was met with dismay around the world yesterday. China and Europe pledged to unite to save 'Mother Earth' as others including the UK and Russia reaffirmed their commitment to the international accord. A key part of the 2015 Paris deal signed by more than 190 nations was a commitment from the richest nations to contribute 78billion a year to the Green Climate Fund to help poorer countries tackle global warming. The UK has promised 720million money that comes from the foreign aid budget and private investors. Former president Barack Obama had pledged 2.3billion from the US. The Paris Climate Agreement commits nations to reduce carbon emissions to stop the world overheating. But Mr Trump who previously dismissed climate change as a 'Chinese hoax' wants to renegotiate terms that are 'fairer' to the US. In a Press conference after a summit between the EU and China European Council president Donald Tusk said the bloc was stepping up co operation with China on climate change. 'Today China and Europe have demonstrated solidarity with future generations and responsibility for the planet' he said. Russia said it was still likely to back the Paris pact although a Kremlin spokesman said Washington's withdrawal had punched a gaping hole in the agreement because the US was one of the biggest generators of emissions. Coal crazy China tries to improve its image Chinahas stepped forward to replace the US as a world leader on climate change. Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris climate accord will bolster China's global stature and help it profit from renewable energy investment an expert predicts. That is despite China being the top emitter of greenhouse gases and by far the world's largest consumer of coal. In a joint statement yesterday the EU and China said action on climate change was 'more important than ever' and both committed to 'significantly intensify' their efforts. Nick Mabey of the climate change think tank E3G said it was the 'strongest bilateral statement on climate' he had seen adding 'President Trump has driven the EU and China together to write the rules for the clean economy.' Coal still accounted for 62 per cent of China's total energy consumption in 2016. In January it suspended or cancelled plans to build another 100 coal fueled power plants. But dozens more are still expected to be built. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sought to ward off criticism by saying the US would continue trying to curb greenhouse emissions despite pulling out of the Paris accord. But French President Emmanuel Macron turned Mr Trump's 'Make America Great Again' campaign slogan on its head saying that it was time to 'make the planet great again'. Prime Minister Theresa May told Mr Trump of her 'disappointment' at his decision in a phone call with the President shortly after his announcement on Thursday. But she was criticised by Labour for failing to add her name to a joint statement issued by European leaders to say that the Paris climate accord cannot be renegotiated as Mr Trump has demanded. Jeremy Corbyn said 'Given the chance to present a united front from our international partners she Mrs May has instead opted for silence and once again subservience to Donald Trump. It's a dereliction of both her duty to this country and our duty to our planet.' Gareth Redmond King head of climate and energy at the World Wide Fund for Nature said investment in renewable energy was a great business opportunity. 'We're calling on the next UK government to step up as a global leader on tackling climate change' he said. 'It is what the public wants it makes economic sense and it is what the world needs in order to safeguard the lives of future generations.'	True	False	False	False	False
Comedian Bill Nye accused CNN of doing a disservice to its viewers for inviting a well respected physicist on Earth Day to argue about the legitimacy of man made global warming. Nye who is well known for hosting a childrens TV show in the 1990s scolded CNNs New Day Saturday panel Saturday for pitting his environmentalist pedigree against the climate skepticism of physicistWilliam Happer. He also suggested the 24 news channel should instead drown out people like Happer with 98 scientists who believe in man made global warming. And I will say much as I love the CNN youre doing a disservice by having one climate change skeptic and not 97 or 98 scientists or engineers concerned about climate change Nye said after the Princeton University academic suggested that it is a myth to believe that carbon dioxide is a pollutant causing widespread ecological destruction. Carbon dioxide is a perfectly natural gas its just like water vapor its something that plants love. They grow better with more carbon dioxide and you can see the greening of the earth already from the additional carbon dioxide in the atmosphere he added. He went on to say that Nyes views on science are backward. Science is based on observation Happer said and if you observe whats happening to for example the temperature the temperature is not rising nearly as fast as the alarmist computer models predicted. Its much much less factors of two or three less. Happer a science adviser to President Donald Trump made public his skeptical views on climate change in January. He told reporters that climate change is tremendously exaggerated adding that climate research is important but I think its become sort of a cult movement in the last five years. Nye who has a degree in engineering but no professional science background called Happers position completely wrong and suggested the physicist was cherry picking a certain model. Some scientists maintain people like Nye are the ones cherry picking data. Climate models predicted Antarctic sea ice would shrink and that climate change would boost snowfall in the southern hemisphere yet neither of those predictions have panned out. In fact scientists now say natural variability is overwhelming their models. Scientists with Columbia Universitys Earth Institute for instance found theres beenalmost no change in Antarcticas snowfall. They blamed strong natural variability for the models failures. Scientists have also warned thatAntarctica has been losing 147 gigatons of ice per yearfor years mostly from melting on the northern Antarctic Peninsula. A NASA conducted in 2015 meanwhile foundAntarcticas ice sheet increased in mass from 1992 to 2008 which essentially offset ice melting in the western part of the Antarctic. Nye for his part has been one of the most belligerent apostle for the environmental movement. Hes even suggested that throwingglobal warming skeptics in jail could be a potential solutionduring an interview with the conservative Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow.

Wyoming's economy is dominated by coal other fossil fuels and mineral extraction. The formula here has worked residents in Wyoming enjoy among the highest per capita GDP in the nation. So naturally there's been some hostility toward new sources of energy that could threaten that. It's a complicated history with wind says Jeremiah Rieman director of economic diversification strategy for Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead R. I think you're seeing a change. And certainly we're hearing the message loud and clear as we go through this economic diversification strategy effort that wind and renewables need to be a part of that. The push toward wind is playing out in a high rise office building 100 miles south of Wyoming's capital in Denver. There TransWest Express is laying out plans to build a 730 mile transmission line across the American West. CEO Bill Miller points to a map and the start of the project 1000 wind turbines to be built on a ranch in south central Wyoming. It starts there and runs a little bit west and then due south into northwest Colorado says Miller tracing a line through Utah and then down south of Las Vegas. If all goes according to plan in three years Miller says the winds of low population Wyoming will be bringing electricity to where it's needed in California. To my knowledge this is the largest transmission line development that has occurred in this country in probably 50 years. TransWest Express which is part of the Anschutz Corporation owned by billionaire Phillip Anschutz is looking to harness Wyoming's wind because well it's super windy. The winds howl in southeast Wyoming because they're rising at the continental divide then pushing through a gap in the Rocky Mountains. So if you remember your high school physics class there's this thing called the Venturi effect where you narrow something and that naturally speeds up an air flow. And that's really what we have here says economist Robert Godby director of the Center for Energy Economics and Public Policy at the University of Wyoming. Wyoming may have strong winds but the state ranks just 16th for wind generation. Godby says Wyoming hasn't exactly made things attractive for developers We have the only wind generation tax in the country where we actually tax people who produce electricity with wind. Meanwhile many other states are creating incentives for wind development for example by creating renewable portfolio standards that require a state to obtain a certain amount of its energy from sources like wind and solar. I think it's really unfair that Wyoming has this reputation for being hostile to wind or anti wind says Jason Beggar director the Wyoming Infrastructure Authority a state entity tasked with developing large transmission projects. It's not an anti wind philosophy it's just the philosophy of the state we tax our natural resources to fund government. Beggar says it's tough to build in Wyoming because roughly half of the state is federally owned land. So when you go to Texas or you go to Iowa you're generally just negotiating with a landowner whether it's a farmer whomever says Beggar. Well in Wyoming you have to file permits with the federal government and that includes things like land use wildlife mitigation mineral disturbances. There are factors and factors and factors. Beggar says the Trump administration has shown a willingness to cut red tape and move things along more quickly. Meanwhile conservationists and environmentalists have bristled at the rollback of regulations. There's another challenge facing Wyoming wind climate change skepticism. Coal burns dirty and produces a lot of greenhouse gases. Many states are pushing renewable energy to move away from that. But in Wyoming it's complicated. Climate change is a pretty tough subject to talk about with some people because it's a threat no matter how you look at it says Robert Godby. It's a threat to world climate it's also a threat to people's livelihoods in Wyoming. And those two things are kind of in conflict. If you're a state like Wyoming where you produce so much fossil fuel in particular coal that's threatened by any sort of climate change policy we might put in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Wyoming's governor Matt Mead professes skepticism on climate science but not on the markets which are moving away from dirtier burning fuels like coal. That's why he's pushing for a more diversified economy. At the end of the day the debate in Wyoming is really about jobs. Bill Miller says that when people learn about the tax revenues and jobs their transmission line and wind farm will bring to Wyoming they like that. These are good high paying jobs. And when we finish this project the permanent jobs are going to be roughly 150 people well paid fully benefitted jobs that are really a boon to those communities says Miller. Wind projects in Wyoming won't come anywhere close to creating enough work to replace the coal industry. Still the jobs are an important part of the state's broader diversification strategy. Roughly 60 percent of our youth between the ages of 18 and 24 will not be here 10 years from now and that's a trend we would like to see disappear says Rieman. Whether new opportunities come from digging up coal or harnessing the wind for job seekers in Wyoming that detail may be of secondary importance. This article originally appeared at PRI's The World.

WASHINGTON A mammoth lands bill that would protect more than 2 million acres and permanently reauthorize a key land and water conservation program heads to President Donald Trump following the House's overwhelming approval Tuesday. The 363 62 vote to pass theNatural Resources Management Act came two weeks after the Senate approved the bill 92 8. Years in the crafting the measurecombines more than 100 separate bills that collectively would designate1340000 acres of new wilderness 367 miles of new scenic rivers and 2600 miles of new national trails. It also would createfour national monuments including the home of slain civil rights icon Medgar Eversin Mississippiand expandthree national parks including Joshua Tree in California. In addition the legislation would require the U.S. Forest Service and the Department of the Interior to begin providing GPS locations for crews on wildfires and to begin using drones to scout and map wildfires in real time. The bill won easy passage in the House in part because it included dozens of individual member's parochial priorities stretching across all 50 states. But it also enjoyed larger buy in. Democratsgot behind the bill because it would expand environmental protections. Republicans supported it because it would expand access to public lands for recreational and hunting purposes. Related Green New Deal What is it and what does it mean for climate change? Related Crumbling national parks Congress looks to hike funds for repairs after years of neglect The very basis of all of the bills that are in here is to put people above government Utah Rep. Rob Bishop the top Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee said on the House floor before the vote. If indeed we're going to have public lands there should be access to those lands. The measure also permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund which uses federal royalties from oil and gas drilling to preserve public lands. It had expired in September. Although the bill does not guarantee that the royalties about 900 million a year flow into the program environmental groups consider making the LWCF permanent an enormous victory. Rep. Debbie Dingell D Mich praised the program for its universal benefits saying the conservation fund has steered 3.9 billion to some 40000 projects in every county across this country since it began in the 1960s. LWCF has protected some of our most treasured natural resources while creating jobs supporting local economies and providing countless opportunitiesfor recreation she said on the House floor.

The word choices by administration officials and the extent to which they're going to avoid referencing global warming altogether are notable in the aftermath of recent severe hurricanes and in the face of questions about what could have caused them. In the wake of Hurricane Irma both Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long and acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke avoided explicitly answering whether the government needs to be more focused on climate change because of hurricanes. Instead they both said the focus should be on resiliency. Regardless of what causes disasters it's our job within the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA to manage the consequences Long told CNN. The only way we become resilient as a nation is we have to create that true culture of preparedness among our citizenry which we do not have and then we also have to look how we move forward when it comes to infrastructure protection. Duke echoed Long's thoughts on the need for resilience. We live in a changing world and as the FEMA administrator said we always have to look at not just the response but the preparedness and the resilience Duke said. And I think it's important that as we come together as a country we look at the changes in our world and make sure that in planning and response that we are adapting properly. Trump dismisses climate change question by contradicting himself on hurricanes Other departments are also adopting the language replacement in some cases making unannounced changes and replacements to their websites and names of programs. In February shortly after President Donald Trump took office the Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration changed language across its website relating to the environmental effects of transportation. The changes swapped words like adaptation with resilience and also renamed the Sustainable Transport and Climate Change Team to The Sustainable Transportation and Resilience Team according to a Environmental Data and Governance Initiative Website Tracking report That same month the Environmental Protection Agency removed all mention of climate change from its water utilities programs. The Climate Ready Water Utilities program was renamed to Creating Resilient Water Utilities. Other references to climate change were also scrubbed from the website Inside Climate News first reported. Over at the USDA an internal memo obtained by CNN that was shared in the first days of the administration to staffers gave specific guidance to ditch the term climate change adaptation and instead opt for resilience to weather extremes. The terms resilience and resiliency rose to popularity in the US government during former President Barack Obama's administration used specifically to denote preparing something to ward off the future effects of climate change. For example following Superstorm Sandy the Department of Housing and Urban Development established a first of its kind competition called the National Disaster Resilience Competition. The aim of the competition was to award grants to communities hit by natural disasters to fund rebuilding them to better weather future events worsened by climate change. The idea is when dollars are spent to rebuild you don't just want to rebuild the same old way you want to rebuild in a way that is smarter and makes it less likely that they will be effected the same way in the future storms that's resiliency former HUD Secretary Julian Castro who awarded the grant at the time told CNN. There's no question that climate change is at least a contributing factor to some of the intensity of these natural disasters. ... The administration ought to take that into consideration and not try to decouple those two Castro said. The verbal judo they are trying to do doesn't serve local communities at all. But administration officials counter that resiliency can have a dual meaning even one that means essentially the same thing but without the overt climate change undertones. Resilience came into our nomenclature in our last administration but that doesn't mean that it's a verboten word any longer said Brian Sullivan a HUD spokesman. The last administration made that very direct connection between the use of that word and words like sustainability with climate change and while there may be a reluctance to do that now I don't think that means folks are any less committed to making sure the next storm is less costly Sullivan said. While Sullivan acknowledged that there's been an intentional shift of language at the department especially as the topic of climate change continues to be discussed or avoided hand in hand with storm preparedness he argues that at the end of the day the administration has the same goals for rebuilding communities. I don't know if there's an operating definition of what resilience means he said. Regardless of why you're doing it what you're doing would be the same whatever motivates you. Whether you believe in climate change or you don't you are embarking on some future activity. We could tie this to climate change or we could tie it to saving taxpayer money.

CNN A new US government report delivers a dire warning about climate change and its devastating impacts saying the economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars or in the worst case scenario more than 10 of its GDP by the end of the century. The federally mandated study was supposed to come out in December but was released by the Trump administration on Friday at a time when many Americans are on a long holiday weekend distracted by family and shopping. The global average temperature is much higher and is rising more rapidly than anything modern civilization has experienced and this warming trend can only be explained by human activities Easterling said. Coming from the US Global Change Research Program a team of 13 federal agencies the Fourth National Climate Assessment was put together with the help of 1000 people including 300 leading scientists roughly half from outside the government. Without significant reductions in greenhouse emissions the annual average global temperature could increase 9 degrees Fahrenheit 5 Celsius or more by the end of this century compared with preindustrial temperatures the report says. The costs of climate change could reach hundreds of billions of dollars annually according to the report. The Southeast alone will probably lose over a half a billion labor hours by 2100 due to extreme heat. Farmers will face extremely tough times. The quality and quantity of their crops will decline across the country due to higher temperatures drought and flooding. In parts of the Midwest farms will be able to produce less than 75 of the corn they produce today and the southern part of the region could lose more than 25 of its soybean yield. Heat stress could cause average dairy production to fall between 0.60 and 1.35 over the next 12 years having already cost the industry 1.2 billion from heat stress in 2010. Wildfire seasons already longer and more destructive than before could burn up to six times more forest area annually by 2050 in parts of the United States. Burned areas in Southwestern California alone could double by 2050. Dependable and safe water for the Hawaii the Caribbean and others are threatened by these rising temperatures. Along the US coasts public infrastructure and 1 trillion in national wealth held in real estate are threatened by rising sea levels flooding and storm surges. Energy systems will be taxed meaning more blackouts and power failures and the potential loss in some sectors could reach hundreds of billions of dollars per year by the end of the century the report said. The number of days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit will multiply Chicago where these days are rare could start to resemble Phoenix or Las Vegas with up to two months worth of these scorching hot days. Sea levels have already gone up 7 to 8 inches since 1900. Almost half that rise has been since 1993 a rate of rise greater than during any century in the past 2800 years. Some countries are already seeing land underwater. By midcentury it's likely that the Arctic will lose all sea ice in late summer and that could lead to more permafrost thaw according to the report. As the permafrost thaws more carbon dioxide and methane would be released amplifying human induced warming possibly significantly. What can be done The report was created to inform policy makers and makes no specific recommendations on how to remedy the problem. However it suggests that if the United States immediately reduced its fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions it could save thousands of lives and generate billions of dollars in benefits for the country. Reactions to the new report have been strong across the scientific community. In Houston communities of color have endured back to back major weather events without the acknowledgment from Washington that climate change is the cause. We've known for years that it's true and it's important to our organizing and our local policy efforts that information like this is not only considered but believed and acted upon. Scientists who have been raising the alarm about the negative consequences of climate change for years welcomed the findings.	True	False	False	True	True
Despite longstanding opposition to renewable energy on the part of President Trump who gave a rambling nearly incoherent disquisition on windmills last weekend the wind power industry in the United States continued to grow in 2019. The country set records for newly installed capacity of wind power in both the second and third quarters of 2019 according to a report by the American Wind Energy Association reaching a total of 100 gigawatts roughly on a par with nuclear plants although in terms of actual power generated as distinguished from theoretical capacity wind is still a fraction of nuclear and fossil fuels. Wind now supplies clean and efficient power to the equivalent of 32 million American homes sustains 500 U.S. factories and delivers more than 1 billion a year in new revenue to rural communities and states Tom Kernan CEO of AWEA said in a statement. At a time when global carbon emissions that cause climate change continue to rise wind power now accounts for 6.5 percent of the energy America produces. Once the wind turbines are constructed the energy they produce is carbon neutral and renewable indefinitely. Yet Trump who believes that climate change is a hoax is no fan of windmills as he once again made clear last weekend in a speech in Florida. Well have an economy based on wind. I never understood wind. You know I know windmills very much. Ive studied it better than anybody. I know its very expensive. Theyre made in China and Germany mostly very few made here almost none. But theyre manufactured tremendous if youre into this tremendous fumes Trump asserted. Gases are spewing into the atmosphere. You know we have a world right? So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous tremendous amount of fumes and everything. You talk about the carbon footprint fumes are spewing into the air. Right? Spewing. Whether its in China Germany its going into the air. Its our air their air everything right? So they make these things and then they put them up. Trump who filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against the government of Scotland to block the construction of offshore wind turbines he said would mar the views from one of his golf resorts also complained in his Florida speech that wind turbines killed birds. Go under a windmill someday you'll see more birds than you've ever seen ever in your life Trump said. While it is true that an estimated 234000 birds die each year in collisions with wind turbines according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service many more are killed by flying into buildings or by domestic cats. In 2018 the Trump administration eliminated criminal penalties for unintentional migratory bird deaths resulting from industrial or agricultural activity the New York Times reported. Despite the rapid growth in the construction of wind power facilities across the U.S. the Interior Department announced in August that it was withholding approval for a wind project off the coast of Massachusetts similar to the one Trump opposed in Scotland. Interior Department spokesman Nicholas Goodwin said in a statement that the government needed to make sure the project was safe and environmentally responsible. In April Trump without citing any evidence told a Republican audience that wind turbines were dangerous to human health. They say the noise causes cancer Trump said. That claim like all the others Trump has made about wind power was quickly refuted. The American Cancer Society is unaware of any credible evidence linking the noise from windmills to cancer a spokesman for the group told the Times in an email.

In a new study economist and environmental analyst Nicholas Loris explained that climate change simply isnt responsible for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Bottom line Loriss analysis stated that man made warming was not responsible forHarvey and Irma. Man made warming did not cause Harvey and Irma Loris wrote. As carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions have increased there have been no trends in global tropical cycle landfalls. Loris said that the average number of hurricanes per decade reaching landfall in the U.S. has fallen over the past 160 years. He added that the study is based on concrete mainstream science and cited reports from The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and NOAA to corroborate hisanalysis. Loris also disputedassertions that global warming supercharged these hurricanes which made them deadlier citing work by University of Washington climatologist Cliff Mass and former director of the National Hurricane Center Bill Read both of whom rejected this claim after conducting research into the phenomenon. With the eastern seaboard still in the thick of hurricane season as well asthe most recent devastation caused by Category 5 Hurricane Maria which was said to cripple Dominica with widespread devastation en route to Puerto Rico and possibly the States its important to maintainlevelheaded perspective and communication on natural disasters while speakingtruth amidstapprehension. In a hyper political environment pro climate change and anti climate change theory rhetoric serves only to distract from the real issue at hand the necessity of serving people impacted by natural disasters and the implementation ofstandardized response to these crises. While much of the media and government is ensconced in creating division among political parties and ideologies its more important to avoid playing into alarmist rhetoric whichonly serves to encourage people throughanxiety and panic. Instead of focusing on the apprehensionand divisiveness surrounding the causes of natural disasters its more important than ever that we maintain our humanity and come together tohelp one another.

Unchecked climate change will cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars and damage human health and quality of life a US government report warns. Future risks from climate change depend... on decisions made today the 4th National Climate Assessment says. The report says climate change is presenting growing challenges to human health and safety quality of life and the rate of economic growth. The warning is at odds with the Trump administration's fossil fuels agenda. During a blast of icy weather in Washington this week Donald Trump tweeted whatever happened to global warming? Now without mentioning the president his own scientists have answered their boss's question in comprehensive detail. Global warming is here in the United States they say now. It is already deadly serious and without urgent dramatic change it will be catastrophic. This report is striking for two reasons. First it is not abstract. It gives many specific examples overwhelmed dams in South Carolina failing crops in the parched Great Plains a rise in insect borne disease in Florida. And secondly it majors on the economic impact in effect challenging the White House's insistence on prioritising economic growth over environmental regulation. With warnings about the effects on crumbling infrastructure falling crop yields and decreasing labour productivity the report sounds an alarm that climate change will soon cascade into every corner of American life. The White House said the report compiled with help from numerous US government agencies and departments was inaccurate. Spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said it was largely based on the most extreme scenario which contradicts long established trends by assuming that... there would be limited technology and innovation and a rapidly expanding population. The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is human induced and warn that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity. The US climate assessment outlines the prospective impacts of climate change across every sector of American society. With continued growth in emissions at historic rates annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century more than the current gross domestic product GDP of many US states the report says. Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century. The report notes that the effects of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country including more frequent and intense extreme weather and climate related events. But it says that projections of future catastrophe could change if society works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to the changes that will occur. Environmental groups said the report underlined their demands for action. Brenda Ekwurzel director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists and one of the report's authors said the report made it clear that climate change was not some problem in the distant future. It's happening right now in every part of the country she said. That view was echoed by Abigail Dillen president of environmental group Earthjustice. While President Trump continues to ignore the threat of climate change his own administration is sounding the alarm she said. In October President Trump accused climate change scientists of having a political agenda telling Fox News he was unconvinced that humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures. After taking office he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures well below 2C above pre industrial levels. At the time Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new fair deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers. During his election campaign in 2016 Mr Trump said climate change was a hoax. However he has since rowed back on that statement saying in a recent interview I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference. A report released in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC the leading international body evaluating climate change said it could only be stopped if the world made major and costly changes. That means reducing global emissions of CO2 by 45 from 2010 levels by 2030 and reducing coal use to almost zero and using up to seven million sq km 2.7 million square miles for land energy crops. If the world fails to act the researchers warned there would be some significant and dangerous changes to our world including rising sea levels significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity and the ability to grow crops such as rice maize and wheat.

Biden took questions from a group in New Castle New Hampshire Friday. One woman associated with the environmental group 350 New Hampshire Action Rebecca Beaulieu asked Biden how voters can trust him if he continues to associate himself with fossil fuel executives. How can we trust that youre going to act on climate on the climate crisis if youre still attending fundraisers that fossil fuel executives are attending? Beaulieuasked according to the Daily Mail. Video shows Biden walking over to the woman taking her hand and making a solemn promise to end fossil fuel before 2050 God willing. Kiddo I want you to just take a look. I want you to look into my eyes Biden began. I guarantee you I guarantee you we are going to end fossil fuel and I am not going to cooperate with them. Before 2050 God willing Biden continued adding that 2030 is not a realistic goal No it cant be done by 2030. No not one single person is arguing it can be done by that. But it can be done by 2050. Maybe 2045? And is the science increases we may be able to move more quickly. But we have to we can fundamentally change things in the next 10 years though so that we set a path? I promise you I promise you. OK. Beaulieu 24 said she wasnt expecting that kind of response from Biden and described it as patronizing. Just a little patronizing because I want to be an adult at the table when it comes to conversations about climate and what were going to do about it and I dont want to be like someone whos sitting on the sidelines waiting for other people to act she said according to the Daily Mail. Im also like actively doing something to try to combat this climate crisis as it stands. Being called a kid is a little patronizing when Im trying to do so much work she added. She also said she was unsatisfied with Bidens refusal to bend his 2050 goal. But I hope that he takes the climate crisis as seriously as he tried to make it seem and that if hes going to keep moving forward with his plans he needs to reevaluate because 2050 is too late she said. Biden recently came under fire for attending a fundraiser hosted by Andrew Goldman a founder of the natural gas company Western LNG. The former vice president dismissed concerns telling viewers of CNNs climate change town hall Wednesday that Goldman is not a fossil fuel executive. He is not a fossil fuel executive Biden said. And the fact of the matter is that what we talk about is what are we going to do about those corporations? What have we done? And everywhere along the way for example Ive argued and pushed for us suing those executives who are engaged in pollution those companies engaged in pollution he added. Ive never walked away from that.	False	False	False	False	True
In its first year in office the Trump administration introduced a solitary new environmental rule aimed at protecting the public from pollution. It was aimed not at sooty power plants or emissions intensive trucks but dentists. Every year dentists fill Americans tooth cavities with an amalgam that includes mercury. About 5 tons of mercury a dangerous toxin that can taint the brain and the nervous system are washed away from dental offices down drains each year. In Trumps first day in the White House the administration told the Environmental Protection Agency EPA to withdraw an Obama era plan that would require dentists to prevent this mercury from getting into waterways. But in June the rule was unexpectedly enacted. This apparent change of heart followed legal action filed by green groups part of a cascade of courtroom standoffs that are starting to slow and even reverse the Trump administrations blitzkrieg of environmental regulations. The Trump administration has been sloppy and careless theyve shown significant disrespect for rule of law and courts have called them on it said Richard Revesz a professor at the New York University school of law. I expect we will see a number of further losses for the administration on similar grounds. If they keep showing the same disregard for the law their attempt to repeal all these environmental regulations will go badly for them. The reversal of Obamas environmental legacy has been spearheaded by Scott Pruitt who heads the EPA the agency he repeatedly sued as Oklahoma attorney general. Pruitt who accused Obama of bending the rule of law and federal overreach has overseen the methodical delay or scrapping of dozens of rules curbing pollution from power plants pesticides and vehicles. Ironically for Pruitt who has touted a back to basics approach rooted safely within the confines of the law this rapidly executed agenda has run into a thicket of legal problems causing the administration to admit defeat in several cases. In July a federal court ruled that the EPA couldnt suspend rules designed to curb methane emissions from new oil and gas wells. This was followed by a hasty retreat in August when the EPA agreed to not delay new standards to reduce smog causing air pollutants the day after 15 states and environment groups sued. Then in December a federal court told the EPA it couldnt delay a new standard for dangerous levels of lead in paint and dust. Other arms of the federal government have also been stymied from implementing Trumps deregulatory agenda. The US Fish and Wildlife Service stung by a lawsuit listed the rusty patched bumblebee as endangered in March after initially delaying the decision. And on Thursday a federal court told the department of energy it must implement four energy efficiency regulations it was looking to scuttle. Many of these legal problems have stemmed from the sheer pace of the rollbacks required public comment periods have been set aside in some cases any rationale for repeal or delay has been missing in others. Opponents of the administration also believe there is a determination to expunge every vestige of Obamas environmental legacy regardless of merit. They are trying to score political points or attempting to grant favours to corporations who dont want to follow the rules said Aaron Colangelo the litigation director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. It all shows that this administration wont protect the environment unless they are sued. They have been reckless and not followed the basic requirements of the law. The EPA now faces a fresh wave of opposition as it looks to craft replacements for major Obama rules such as the clean power plan which sought to limit emissions from coal fired power plants and the waters of the US rule which greatly expanded clean water protections. If the proposed replacements are as expected far less onerous on industry than current iterations environmentalists and around a dozen states headed by New York and California will be poised to further jam up the process in the courts. Over and over again the Trump administration has put the profits of multinational polluters over the health and well being of everyday Americans said Eric Schneiderman New Yorks attorney general. Schneiderman has been prolific in opposing Trumps environmental revisions filing more than 50 lawsuits during the administrations first year to among other things protect the clean power plan enforce stricter vehicle pollution standards and ensure that chlorpyrifos a common pesticide linked to neurological harm to children is banned. Weve already beaten back several of this administrations toxic policies from energy efficiency rollbacks to smog Schneiderman said. Our fight to protect public health and our environment will continue in court.	True	False	False	True	True
CNN The acting director of the federal agency responsible for managing one in every 10 acres of land in the United States has repeatedly denied the existence of climate change and falsely claimed in a 1990s speech there was no credible evidence of a hole in the ozone layer. William Perry Pendley was appointed by Interior Secretary David Bernhardt as the acting director of the Department of Interior's Bureau of Land Management in July 2019. Prior to his appointment Pendley was a conservative activist commentator lawyer and served as the longtime president of the conservative Mountain States Legal Foundation. Despite the total absence of credible scientific evidence the media is convinced and is attempting to convince us that we have global warming an Ozone hole and acid rain and that it is all man's fault Pendley said in a 1992 speech to the Heritage Foundation. In other comments uncovered during a CNN KFile review of his social media activity writings and public appearances Pendley cited an anti Muslim figure to claim Islam was at war with the United States compared undocumented immigrants to cancer and blamed them for diseases. Asked about his comments and if he still holds his views Pendley said his views were being taken out of context and were irrelevant to his role at BLM. As someone in the public arena for nearly four decades I've given countless statements and written scores of articles on a wide variety of topics. Cherrypicking a few of them out of context is neither useful nor connected to my current position. I'm focused now on implementing the policy priorities of the Trump administration and Secretary Bernhardt within the authorities and mission given this agency by Congress. My personal views are irrelevant in this context. 'Environmentalism' is indeed the last refuge of the left the last safe haven for those who trust not the people but big government those who seek to place the power in the hands of federal bureaucrats Pendley said. No wonder the environmental message has became the cause of choice for the elitists of Hollywood. It should not surprise us that they have embraced environmentalism with the same self righteous fervor as they once embraced socialism and communism. Despite the total absence of credible scientific evidence the media is convinced and is attempting to convince us that we have global warming an Ozone hole and acid rain and that it is all man's fault he added. Pendley has repeatedly denied the existence of climate change and mocked the scientific consensus around environmental issues as rooted in bad science. I debated an environmentalist on television here in Denver and and it's he she was quoting people about global warming and I said you realize the people you're quoting just a couple of years ago were predicting global cooling on a massive scale that we would not be able to feed ourselves. And it stopped her for just a second Pendley said. And then she said 'Well it's going to be something.' And that's what the environmentalists say. It's going to be something to quote another movie from the movie The Fly 'Be afraid be very afraid.' And that's what they're preaching. They're preaching fear. At times Pendley's denial of climate change has drifted into even more fringe claims linking the broader US environmental movement to the fall of the Soviet Union and communism. Because of the collapse of communism because the wall has come down because the Soviet Union is no more...the environmental movement is the last refuge of people who favor government over people he said. Who knew? Islam's war with America started just up the road in Greeley Colorado! Pendley tweeted. In the article Spencer floats unfounded conspiracies about leftists allying with Islamic hardliners who adhere to Sharia a system of laws that would have many of them executed. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and President Barack Obama think if one can call it thinking or anything more than wishful thinkingthat Americans should be afraid of terrorist attacks not from all those who embrace radical Islam but from their countrymen who hold very strong views on important issues of the day? Pendley wrote. Pendley has repeatedly used extreme rhetoric to refer to undocumented immigrants. You see the problems Hazleton or Valley Park faces could be in your community next because illegal immigration is spreading like a cancer Pendley wrote. Partly this is because Mexico and some other governments promote and encourage illegal immigration into our country. Pendley went on to say if massive immigration continued you and I will permanently lose the country we love Frustrated by the failure of the federal government to address the issue of illegal immigration and the problems it poses for the tiny cash strapped city including violent crime crowded schools hospital costs and the demand for servicesthe City Council at the request of Mayor Lou Barletta adopted legislation to deal with these problems. Violent crimeincluding dangerous gangs over crowded schools the appearance of diseases once vanquished from the western world escalating hospital costs and an overwhelming demand for government services! Pendley wrote. These are the new problems being faced by small cash strapped cities and towns all across America. The source illegal immigrants.	False	False	False	True	True
Congressional Republicans have opened an investigation into a second U.S. based environmental group over its ties to the Chinese government. Top Republicans on the House Natural Resources Committee asked the World Resources Institute WRI an environmental advocacy group to turn over documents related to its work with Chinese officials and their advocacy in the U.S. Lawmakers want to know if WRIs desire to maintain good relations with the Chinese is affecting the groups U.S. operations and advocacy effectively making it a foreign agent of the communist government. WRIs desire to maintain access to Chinese officials may influence its political activities in the United States Republican Reps. Rob Bishop of Utah and Bruce Westermanof Arkansaswrote in a letter to WRI President Andrew Steer sent Wednesday. Given WRIs close ties to the Chinese government its emphasis on cultivating contacts with various U.S. officials is particularly disconcerting in light of the government partnerships and environmental initiatives involving WRI during the Obama Administration they wrote. RELATED NYT Suggests Global Warming Is To Blame For Roger Federers US Open Defeat Since President Trumps election WRI political activities have turned to influencing state and municipal governments the lawmakers wrote. In at least one governors office WRI has embedded a senior environmental adviser and appears to exercise a high level of control of the governments environmental agenda. WRI describes itself as a nonprofit global research organization that operates in more than 60 countries including China. WRI played a role in the Paris Agreement negotiations in 2015 and praised China for its pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Chinas Paris accord pledge however has been criticized by experts who saw it as nothing more than promising to continue current economic trends. WRI opposed President Donald Trumps decision to leave the Paris accord in 2017 in a statement that also praised China for committing to the climate agreement. WRI is the second group Bishop and Westerman investigated for ties to China. Lawmakers asked the Natural Resource Defense Council NRDC for documents related to its Chinese ties in June. NRDC has a two decade relationship with Chinas communist government which it has heaped praise on for its commitment to fighting pollution and global warming. At the same time NRDC has relentlessly attacked the Trump administration Bishop and Westerman said in their letter to the group. Bishop and Westerman said NRDC and WRI activities mirror those laid out in reports on Chinas vast influence machine which it uses to shape its global image including on environmental issues. WRI has operated in China since 2008 and was issued a registration certificate in 2017 to work under the guidance and supervision of the Beijing Public Security Bureau and Chinese Ministry of Ecology and Environment the lawmakers wrote. WRI leadership regularly interacts with senior Chinese government and Communist party officials and provides public support for Chinese environmental programs Bishop and Westerman wrote.While WRI criticizes policies of the U.S. government WRI is silent on Chinese human rights violations such as arrests of environmental protesters and the mass detention of ethnic minorities. On important issues for Chinese leadership WRIs position appears to closely reflect Chinas goals and objectives the two lawmakers added. WRI did not immediately respond to The Daily Caller News Foundations request for comment.	False	False	False	True	False
ABC News Videos EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the agency unveiled a plan to start considering regulations on cancer causing perfluorinated substances or PFAS. The agency released whatActing EPA AdministratorAndrew Wheelercalled the most comprehensive cross agency plan to address an emerging chemical of concern ever undertaken by EPA. The regulator said it would set a limit for the chemical under the Safe Drinking Water Act by the end of the year. Wheeler said the EPA had already begun the regulatory development process for listing PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances making it easier to marshal funds to clean up contaminations. He said the plan would include new research methods to monitor pollution. Reports last month said Wheeler widely condemned for his links to big industry would not regulate the chemicals known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl compounds sometimes called perfluorinated substances or PFAS at all. But critics say the EPA has gathered more than enough data over the past decade to propose an immediate drinking water standard called a maximum contaminant limit. EPA needs to release strict drinking water standards and not just do a plan or do more research said Judith Enck a former regional EPA administrator who began dealing with a PFAS crisis in upstate New York in 2014. There is enough data to take action. There is not enough urgency by Acting Administrator Wheeler and he is putting the health of millions of Americans at risk. The announcement came as the EPA published its proposal to gut the Waters of the U.S. rule which extended protections to streams and wetlands that feed the drinking water of 117 million Americans. Wheeler whose nomination to be the nations 15th EPA administrator awaits a Senate confirmation vote took heat for refusing to commit to regulating PFAS at a hearing last month. Politico reported in January that the EPA did not plan to limit the chemicals. Asked if it was possible the EPA may eventually fail to set a maximum containment limit or MCL Wheeler said the agency cant predetermine what the outcome will be but has every intention of setting an MCL. The health and environmental effects of PFAS remained virtually ignored by regulators for decades. In the late 1990sa crusading attorneysued E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. over a massive contamination in Parkersburg West Virginia that killed livestock and sickened and deformed many residents in the rural Appalachian community that surrounded the chemical companys plant. After a years long legal battle DuPont divested its Chemours division and the companies reached a670 million agreementto settle 3550 personal injury lawsuits in February 2017. Minnesota based chemical giant 3M is now facing mounting lawsuits of its own. Yet the chemicals remain unregulated at the federal level. In January 2009 the EPA issued its first advisory in response to contamination in Alabama stating that perfluorooctanoic acid or PFOA one of the chemicals in the family posed a health risk only in concentrations higher than 400 parts per trillion. For perfluorooctane sulfonate or PFOS a sister chemical commonly used in fire retardants the EPA pegged the limit at 200 parts per trillion. In 2016 the EPA issued a newhealth advisorylowering the risk threshold to 70 parts per trillion for both PFOA and PFOS. That set off a chain reaction exposing local contaminations across the country including several in New York State. Last May the EPA hosted anational leadership summiton PFAS but the agencys decision to bar reporters from attending sessions and one officials manhandling of an Associated Press reporter overshadowed the event. Later that month the White House and EPA moved to suppress an Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry report that found PFAS pose health risks at 70 parts per trillion. A safer limit would be closer to 11 parts per trillion the agency determined.	False	False	False	True	False
Last year was the Earth's warmest recorded year the third year in a row to set a new record for global average temperatures. Rising temperatures are likely to increase the intensity and impact of major storms scientists say yet in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma the Trump administration has resisted talking about climate change at all. Several key administration officials have been on message this week declining to discuss the issue and how to address the causes of global warming and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Mick Mulvaney the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget said climate change is a longer discussion on another day and a big topic for the media. I'll be more than happy to have a longer discussion on another day about climate change man made climate change Mulvaney told CNN's Jake Tapper on The Lead Wednesday. What we are focusing on right now is taking care of the folks who survived this disaster who need our immediate help he said. There's plenty of time later on to have those discussions and I know we will because climate change is clearly a big topic for the media but we will continue to focus our attention on the folks who need it right now. Both FEMA administrator Brock Long and acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke avoided explicitly answering in CNN interviews Tuesday whether the government needs to be more focused on climate change because of hurricanes such as Harvey and Irma. Both instead said the focus needs to be on preparedness and resiliency. Regardless of what causes disasters it's our job within the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA to manage the consequences Long told CNN. The only way we become resilient as a nation is we have to create that true culture of preparedness among our citizenry which we do not have and then we also have to look how we move forward when it comes to infrastructure protection. Duke echoed Long's thoughts on the need for resiliency a term frequently used during the administration's storm response. We live in a changing world and as the FEMA administrator said we always have to look at not just the response but the preparedness and the resilience said Duke. And I think it's important that as we come together as a country we look at the changes in our world and make sure that in planning and response that we are adapting properly. Pushed about whether the administration should also be looking at the cause of the storm Duke responded I you know the data I don't know what it particularly indicates. We haven't had a major storm like this in a quite a while. Duke added that she had to talk to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration about whether the storms were an anomaly year or a trend year. Global warming will likely cause tropical cyclones to intensify on average globally and add to a larger potential for destruction according to NOAA Tom Bossert White House adviser on Homeland Security was equally remiss to talk about the likely causes of the two hurricanes at a White House briefing Monday. Causality is something outside of my ability to analyze right now he said. There's a cyclical nature to a lot of these hurricanes. We continue to take seriously the climate change not the cause of it but the things we observe. He added that the White House would have to perform a trend analysis in the future insinuating that hurricane systems are cyclical and not tied to global warming. President Donald Trump who pulled the US out of the Paris climate accords earlier this year has previously called global warming a hoax. When asked whether Trump's personal opinion on climate change has changed at all White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said I don't think that it's changed over the last several weeks adding that she remains unsure whether the President is reconsidering the Paris deal following the hurricanes. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt told CNN in an interview about Hurricane Irma on Thursday that the time to talk about climate change isn't now saying the question was insensitive. Here's the issue Pruitt said. To have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm versus helping people or actually facing the effect of the storm is misplaced. In addition to the administration's efforts to wipe mention of climate change from the federal agency websites it has proposed cutting EPA funding intended to assist coastal communities in preparing for the impacts of climate change as well as rolled back regulations meant to advise on building against rising sea levels.

The move fulfills part of President Donald Trump's promise to help the coal industry but will likely face court challenges from environmental groups and several states who see the rollback as detrimental to clean air and efforts to fight the climate crisis. Former President Barack Obama's plan if implemented would have prevented 3600 premature deaths a year 1700 heart attacks and 90000 asthma attacks according to analysis conducted by the EPA under his tenure. The Obama Clean Power Plan was set to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to the climate crisis by up to 32 compared to 2005 levels by the same year. We are gathered here today because the American public elected a president with a better approach EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said Wednesday. In an initial announcement about the proposal last summer the Trump EPA labeled Obama's plan as overly prescriptive and burdensome. Instead the administration says the plan rule instead empowers states promotes energy independence and facilitates economic growth and job creation the release stated. RELATED More coal fired power plants have closed under Trump than in Obama's first term Democrats are betting big on big plans for 2020 Obama's Clean Power Plan was challenged by several lawsuits from industry groups and conservative led states. In 2016 the Supreme Court blocked the regulation but some plants had already started to work on reducing pollution. The new plan which EPA is calling the Affordable Clean Energy rule is designed to boost the struggling coal industry but also likely increase carbon emissions nationwide. EPA argues that any comparison to the Obama rule is incongruous because it was never implemented. The Affordable Clean Energy rule ACE gives states the regulatory certainty they need to continue to reduce emissions and provide affordable and reliable energy for all Americans Wheeler said. Unlike the CPP the ACE rule adheres to the four corners of the Clean Air Act. EPA sets the best system of emission reductions and then states set the standards of performance. But it's unclear how much the industry can benefit as it faces competition from cheap natural gas and renewable sources. US coal consumption has plunged 39 to the lowest level in 40 years according to the US Energy Information Administration. RELATED America's renewable energy capacity is now greater than coal New York Attorney General Letitia James said her state and others will go to court. Given its clear violation of the Clean Air Act I intend to sue the EPA over this Dirty Power rule and look forward to collaborating with other states and cities in taking action to protect all Americans from the increasingly disastrous impacts of climate change James said in a statement. Connecticut is in close coordination with states across the nation and we are prepared to take legal action to block this measure the state's attorney general William Tong. There is no serious debate climate change is a severe threat and we ignore science at our own peril. At a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing last week about the direction of the EPA former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy who finalized the Clean Power Plan under Obama said she believes the proposed Affordable Clean Energy rule as well as other proposed rules the agency has made since Trump took office undermines the science and the law in how they're trying to roll back those rules. I do not dispute any administration coming in with different policies but the challenge I think we're facing is they are really changing the rules of the road and not using sound science McCarthy said. They are not looking at cost benefits. They are trying to inflate the cost and lower the benefits in order to justify rules that simply don't make sense under the law.

Reuters Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D N.Y. waves at an enthusiastic crowd of hometown supporters half of whom raised their hands when MSNBC host Chris Hayes a fellow Bronx native asked who was from the borough. On Tuesday four members of the Senates Democratic caucus joined every Republican in voting to block a resolution staking out what should be in future Green New Deal legislation. On Wednesday conservatives leading voice of reason on climate change published a widely shared essay that offered talking points to oppose the Green New Deal without invoking hamburger bans Stalinism or genocide. On Thursday night President Donald Trump smeared the Green New Deal as an extreme 100 trillion government takeover at a rally in Michigan leading the crowd in chants of AOC sucks. As her allies are readying primary challenges against Democrats who refuse to join the Green New Deals 100 co sponsors in Congress Ocasio Cortez said You dont necessarily have to replace everybody. Instead shes betting the increasingly visible and deadly effects of climate change will unite a popular base so vast the market fundamentalists in both parties who oppose the kind of New Deal era big government policies needed to match the scope of the climate crisis will fall in line. For years positions in the debate over mainstream climate policies ranged from hard line denial of climate change on one end to moderate market tweaks on the other. Democrats regularly introduced bills to put a price on carbon dioxide emissions through a cap and trade scheme or a carbon tax. Tax incentives for renewable energy sources like solar and wind enjoyed bipartisan support yet so too did subsidies for oil and gas production. Then in October United Nations scientists forecast average temperatures to increase at least 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit a catastrophic spike likely to cost 54 trillion in damage and countless lives unless world governments took unprecedented measures to halve global emissions over the next decade. A month later a congressionally mandated report by 13 federal agencies confirmed the research. The findings made clear that market fixes alone might have worked in the 1970s when scientists first understood the climate impacts of burning fossil fuels but now its too late. That hasnt helped tamp down opposition from powerful building trades unions that rely on the pipeline and coal train industries for lucrative jobs. Countering the fossil fuel industrys appeal to organized labor is an uphill battle for Green New Deal advocates. Very few renewable energy jobs are unionized and the steady march of right to work laws in red states over the past decade makes it difficult to envision a future in which new industries enjoy the same labor precedents as older ones. Ocasio Cortez said that was one reason the Green New Deal movement could not abandon its class politics to secure support from avowedly pro business conservatives. We cannot allow for the fossil fuel jobs to be better more dignified and higher waged with stronger labor support behind them than new energy jobs she said. What Im tired of is us worrying more about the future of fossil fuels than worry about the future of fossil fuel workers. On Monday Sen. Lamar Alexander R Tenn. cribbed the Green New Deals rhetoric harkening to a World War II level mobilization effort when he proposed a New Manhattan Project for Clean Energy that he said would double federal funding for energy research and implement a five year plan to create new sources of cheap clean energy. That same week Rep. Matt Gaetz R Fla. a loyal Trump ally drafted a nonbinding resolution staking out a Green Real Deal that would acknowledge the threat climate change poses to human health and safety in communities across the United States. We have this idea that left ideas are moving and shaking inside the political atmosphere right now. Thats true. But theyre left in terms of Washington. But in terms of the American people theyre centrist ideas. Heather McGhee senior fellow at the progressive think tank Demos A decade of disputation is followed now by this incredible uptick of Republicans looking around for solutions former Rep. Bob Inglis R S.C. whose support for climate action led to his ouster in a primary challenge in 2010 said at the event where he was the lone Republican. Weve now seen the whites of its eyes. Its here now so its hard to deny.	False	False	False	False	False
The Amazon rainforest is on fire and the consensus is that Brazils far right populist leader Jair Bolsonaro is to blame. Bolsonaro who took office in January and has been referred to as Captain Chainsaw gutted funding for agencies protecting the massive rainforest essentially giving wink and nudge approval for illegal loggers to do their thing. Fire is used as a tool for clearing Amazon land for ranching and the more trees are cut down the more vulnerable the rainforest is to wildfires. There have been almost twice as many fires detected in 2019 so far as there were in the entirety of 2018. Its hard to overstate how threatening this policy is to the climate. The Amazon is the worlds largest rainforest its trees scrub the Earth of a significant amount of CO2 and have captured a huge amount of carbon and methane within their branches and roots. If you lose the trees a lot of greenhouse gases get released and it becomes harder to capture emissions from other sources. Continued fires and clear cutting in the Amazon could cripple the fight against climate change. All of this goes to underscore an important and poorly understood point The wave of right wing populism sweeping the world is not only dangerous for the countries who succumb to it or even to immigrants wishing to move to those nations. Its a fundamental threat to progress against climate change and thus the entirety of the human race. Bolsonaro has been dubbed the Trump of the Tropics a far right firebrand who shares the American presidents hostility to democracy and penchant for saying extremely offensive things about women and minorities. The similarities clearly extend to climate policy Trump famously labeled climate change a Chinese hoax pulled out of the Paris agreement on climate change and recently presented a carbon regulation plan that could actually increase emissions. The American and Brazilian leaders are particularly aggressive on the issue but theyre hardly alone among Western right wingers. A February report from the German Adelphi Institute an environmental think tank found that 18 out of the 21 largest European far right parties are either generally indifferent to climate action or outright oppose it. Nigel Farage the leader of Britains Brexit party recently called climate change a scam during an interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Germanys Alternatives for Deutschland AfD claims in its most recent electoral platform that CO2 is not a pollutant but an indispensable component of all life. By contrast the centrist and left parties in these countries were prior to the populist wave of the past few years doing a markedly better job on addressing climate change not perfect or sufficient mind you but comparatively much better than what the far right parties want. Between 2003 2011 a left wing Brazilian government managed to cut Amazon deforestation rates by 80 percent. Obama massively boosted the American renewables industry via the 2009 stimulus helped negotiate the Paris Climate Accord and implemented the Clean Power Plan to cut emissions from US power plants. In 2005 the EU put in place the worlds first major emissions permit and trading system the European Union Emissions Trading System or EU ETS. So theres a clear contrast between the right wing populists on the one hand and their leading opponents on the other. Right wing populism today centers on a particular kind of chauvinistic nationalism an America First style obsession with the importance of their typically ethnically defined home nation and its independence from international institutions. European populists hate the European Union with its open borders approach to immigration and transnational economic regulations both Trump and Bolsonaro have insulted international institutions and withdrawn from global agreements. This brand of populism poses a particular challenge for the effort against climate change. Its a global issue that no one country can solve on its own it requires collective action negotiated through some forum like the Paris Climate Agreement. Its a paradigmatic example of the limits of nationalism and the need for organizations like the UN and EU. You cant propose an effective solution to a transnational problem through a narrowly nationalist framework and yet the nationalists are here attacking both climate policies in their own country and the very idea of global governance itself. This is a crucial time a recent UN report claims we have 11 years to prevent irreversible damage from climate change. Large population centers like the United States Brazil and the EU as a bloc are responsible for a major chunk of emissions. Its especially important that wealthy countries take the lead on the issue. Poorer countries are less likely to act when they think theyre unfairly bearing the burden of a problem kickstarted by Western industrial development. Backsliding in the US and Europe hurts climate action everywhere. Right wing populists are often framed as a threat to Western democracy and they certainly are that. But the stakes are even bigger than they appear at first glance Its not just the survival of Western democracy thats at stake but the planet itself.	True	False	False	True	True
Julin Castro the first 2020 Democratic presidential candidate at the CNN climate town hall set the tone early in the night by giving a shout out to Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington the self professed climate candidate whose six part plan has been adopted by several other candidates since he dropped out of the race last month. Calling climate change an existential threat a phrase that is sure to come up several more times tonight Mr. Castro said his first move as president would be to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord. The United States hasnt actually withdrawn from the global climate change agreement and legally cannot until November 2020 but President Trump has vowed to do so. Still Mr. Castro said its actually what comes next that is most important saying he would impose a fee on carbon pollution enact an executive order prohibiting fossil fuel exploration and development on public lands and spend 10 trillion over 10 years to reach net zero emissions by 2045. The former secretary for Housing and Urban Development and mayor of San Antonio drew on his experience working with families who had lost their homes to flooding and called for subsidizing the National Flood Insurance Program. An activist from the Sunrise Movement a liberal environmental group asked Mr. Castro why he should be trusted to move the country away from fossil fuels when he supported fracking. Shes right. When I was mayor of San Antonio I did believe that there were opportunities to be had with fracking that was going on in South Texas. But he said at the time natural gas was described as a bridge fuel to help wean the country off coal and toward cleaner fuels. Were coming to the end of the bridge Mr. Castro said. He said while he isnt calling for an immediate national ban on fracking he supports local communities that do so and called for moving to cleaner sources. Mr. Castro won some of his strongest applause when he leaned into his rsum as the nations housing chief and connected his work with the need to protect low income communities from environmental damages. He recounted discovering that 70 percent of subsidized housing was within a mile of a superfund site saying Thats the environmental injustice of racism that were dealing with.

Yahoo News reported Saturday that temperatures in Great Britain could reach as low as 14C with snow event after snow event expected to hit various parts of the territory. Forecasters expect the lasting cold spell to begin sometime this month and to continue at least through March. October is now looking like it will turn out to be colder than average with more of a chance of something wintery setting in through the second half of the month according to Exacta Weather forecaster James Madden. There is a strong chance of widespread frosts and the chance of snowfall which will set the scene for November Madden said. This will pave the way for what is shaping up to be a colder than average winter with some extreme cold weather events. Snow events have been few and far between in recent years but this winter is looking favourable to bring snow event after snow event as weather systems from the Atlantic clash with cold stagnated air over the UK he said. Current sea temperatures combined with a weather system over the north Atlantic suggest that a freezing vortex of Arctic air could hit the country later this month Yahoos Victoria Bell reported. The system will presumably descend from the North Pole ushering in a swath of low pressure spanning from Greenland to the northwest coast of Ireland. In the estimation of some meteorologists the 2019 2020 cold spell will rival the bitter winter of 1963 believed to have been the coldest in 200 years. Other weather watchers are less confident that this winter will be a record breaker. Mark Saunders for example Professor of Climate Prediction at UCL claims that there is only a 57 percent probability that this winter will be colder than last years. Late last month a group of over 500 scientists and climate professionals sent a European Climate Declaration to the Secretary General of the United Nations appealing for an open debate on climate change. Climate science should be less political while climate policies should be more scientific the declaration stated. Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation. There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes floods droughts and suchlike natural disasters or making them more frequent they continued. The declarations signers insisted that public policy must respect scientific and economic realities and not just reflect the most fashionable trend of the day. There is no climate emergency. Therefore there is no cause for panic and alarm they noted. We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050. No matter what the winter shapes up to be there is a 100 percent probability that climate alarmists will find some way to attribute the weather to global warming and carbon dioxide emissions.

The idea started to gain traction after a fisherman spoke to Warren at the town hall event expressing concern the Green New Deal does not go far enough to address problems associated with the oceans. My oyster farm was destroyed by two hurricanes. Now warming waters and acidification are killing seed coast to coast and reducing yields. Those of us that work on the water we need climate solutions and we need them now the man said. The trouble is is the Green New Deal only mentions our oceans one time. This is despite the fact that our seas soak up more than 25 percent of the worlds carbon. So whats your plan for a Blue New Deal for those of us working on the oceans? he asked. Warren immediately embraced the idea of a Blue New Deal. I think hes got it exactly right. We need a Blue New Deal as well she continued telling the audience about her conversations with commercial fishermen who say the warming waters are making their jobs more difficult. I talk to folks who fish commercially off our shores down by New Bedford up by Gloucester. You know what they tell me? They keep pulling stuff up that they dont even know what it is. And so what do they do? I talked to one who said so Id call my brother in law who fishes commercially off the coast of Florida because I send him pictures and he says oh yeah we used to catch those down here. But now theyve moved to Boston and to the waters around Massachusetts and New England. So heres what really scares me. This isnt slowing down. Its speeding up. Where are they going next? And what are we going to be left with? We count on our oceans for life not just for food but what it means in our entire climate. You want to call it a Blue New Deal count me in. But part of getting the carbon out of the air out of the water out of the soil is also about the change in whats happening in our oceans these big dead patches now and the patches of trash. However Warren did not issue a specifics for a Blue New Deal proposal Which goes back to a point I was making earlier and that is we cant just think about cleaning up the United States of America. We cannot think about from the East Coast to the West Coast plus Hawaii and Alaska. We cant just think from the Canadian border down to the border with Mexico. We have to think about the whole world. And thats why many of my plans intersect with our global opportunities and responsibilities. Like I said lots of plans elizabethwarren.comclimate. Because weve got to be working on all fronts. Despite Warrens lack of details Democrats seem to be on board with the concept. Were trying to step into this void because most of the climate plans are really focused on the big manufacturing and industrial emitters and the big terrestrial sources of pollution said Jason Scorse director of the Center for the Blue Economy at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies and any early crafter of the Blue New Deal approach. Thats great and they should do this but there is this overlooked ocean component that can play a big role in any eventual climate solution. The ocean is a huge part of the climate system that people dont talk about and it could be part of the solution because the coastal ecosystem holds more carbon said Ayana Johnson a marine biologist and founder of Ocean Collectiv. Its not green versus blue its just that the ocean has a huge part to play in the climate system. Coasts face unbelievable change. Its not all related to climate and carbon but those are amplifying and accelerating those changes at every level from coastal infrastructure to fishery conservation said Brad Warren executive director at the National Fisheries Conservation Center. Scorse argues the U.S. needs to invest in aquaculture growing underwater plants that can capture carbon and protect against storm surges along with shellfish like oysters that help filter the water the Hill reports. It adds that a Blue New Deal would emphasize tremendous investments in coastal infrastructure. Warren has yet to roll out an official Blue New Deal proposal but her 3 trillion climate change planinspired by Washington Gov. Jay Inslee D is expansive pulling from many of her existing plans to address issues broadly related to the topic of climate change.	True	False	False	True	True
After years of failing to pass a carbon tax climate hawks are now rallying behind a bold new proposal for tackling global warming. Known as the Green New Deal this economic stimulus package for the planet promises to dramatically cut carbon emissions through government spending on clean energy jobs technologies and infrastructure. The main selling point of the Green New Deal has been its politics. While carbon pricing has long been touted as the most cost effective policy for reducing emissions it has struggled to gain legislative traction. By contrast advocates of the Green New Deal believe their proposal can build a winning coalition by reframing climate policy as a story of economic growth and opportunity. A Green New Deal is not just good politics. It is good economics. Society can combat climate change by using existing clean technologies to cut emissions today or by innovating new clean technologies to cut emissions in the future. We need both strategies to address global warming. Every second that we delay in reducing our carbon footprint imposes costs on ourselves and on countless future generations. If we want to avoid climate catastrophe we need to make deep cuts in emissions soon. On the other hand the challenges and costs of relying solely on current technologies to address climate change are prohibitively high. We need investments in clean innovation to make it cheaper to reduce emissions in the future. We could achieve the twin goals of slashing emissions and spurring innovation by putting a very high price on greenhouse gases. Carbon taxes can encourage industries to both reduce their footprints and develop cheaper clean technologies. However carbon pricing by itself is not the most efficient climate policy. As we explain in a recent paper the cheaper and faster approach for our society is to combine a moderately sized carbon tax with significant federal spending on the development and deployment of clean technologies. While carbon pricing is the most cost effective way to reduce emissions today government subsidies are the most cost effective way to advance clean technologies tomorrow. The intuition behind all this is simple. Policies work best when they are narrowly tailored to the behavior that they seek to alter. Thus if we want markets to produce more clean innovation we should reward innovators rather than penalize polluters in the hopes that doing so will indirectly induce them to produce innovation. The benefits of directly encouraging clean innovation are striking. Economists have estimated our society can save more than 1.4 trillion a year if governments used a combination of taxes and subsidies rather than taxes only to address climate change. In short good economics calls for the type of broad federal spending on clean innovation that the Green New Deal promises to deliver. Of course the effectiveness of the proposal at spurring innovation will depend on its design the exact details of which have yet to be ironed out. The package should increase funding for early stage clean energy research as this kind of basic science is usually too risky to attract private investors. The Green New Deal should also include subsidies for the adoption and deployment of clean technologies such as tax credits for clean energy investment and manufacturing. These types of policies that help emerging technologies scale up and mature can be powerful drivers of clean energy innovation. Critics will undoubtedly argue that we cannot afford the Green New Deal. This line of attack however ignores the costs of inaction. While the Green New Deal will not be cheap its price pales in comparison to the damage that unchecked climate change will inflict on the economy. This argument also ignores the savings that will result from the push toward clean energy innovation under the Green New Deal. The development of cheaper clean technologies should more than offset the costs of the stimulus package. Opponents will also claim that the government is a bad venture capitalist and that a Green New Deal will pour taxpayer dollars into clean energy boondoggles. While concerns about government waste are certainly real they can be avoided through smart policy design. The government can encourage innovation without favoring particular clean technologies or companies by enacting neutral research and development tax credits. The ideal economic climate policy does include carbon pricing. But we cannot let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Even if the government cannot enact the best policy for cutting emissions today it can still use the best policy for advancing clean innovation tomorrow. The Green New Deal pushes climate policy into uncharted political waters but it does so based on sound economic theories. If we want to save the planet for the least amount of money we need the Green New Deal and we need it now. Quentin Karpilow is a law clerk in the federal judiciary.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren D MA on Friday praised the climate change activists who are striking on Black Friday urging them to stay strong in this fight! Climate change activists across the globe opted to protest what they consider a climate crisis on the biggest shopping day of the year disrupting shoppers at the Water Tower Place shopping mall in Chicago Illinois and holding a Black Friday Funeral For Future in the nations capital Warren emphatically expressed her support for their efforts. Climate change is an existential threat and its going to take a grassroots movement ready to fight for big structural change to defeat it Warren wrote. Im standing with the young activists on todaystay strong in this fight! While protests indeed broke out across the globe the protest in D.C. featured a funeral procession to draw attention to the crisis and show that business as usual can not continue. Well gather on the Southeast lawn of the Capitol to eulogize and mourn all that has been lost and all that is threatened by the climate crisis the events description reads. All those with hopes and dreams who cherish the future are invited to gather in the shadow of the Halls of Congress. The ceremonial closed casket funeral will conclude with a funeral procession through the streets of Washington DC it added quoting activists who called petroleum a plague and the black death of our generation. Were bringing the loss of our future to the steps of the Capitol because they need to prepare to own this death 17 year old organizer Maddie Graham said. We need systemic change. Congress has been feeding our fossil fuel addiction Graham added. They know they are killing our future but they wont take action to save it. Meanwhile Warren has attempted to channel Gov. Jay Inslees D climate change proposals in recent months. Warren said during an interview with New Hampshire Public Radio in October We do those three things we cut carbon emission in our country by 70 percent. Think about that three things 70 percent reduction she added. The host asked Warren a listener question name the specific steps she has taken in her campaign to ensure that your campaigns environmental impact is limited as possible. Warren did not go into detail but claimed that she mostly flies commercial. So Ive mostly been flying commercial Warren said. Its everything from the kind of car we drive and down to do we purchase offsets? Can we make that work s a way to try to reduce the footprint she added	False	False	False	True	False
Trump administration officials are keeping their lips sealed on whether they believe there are connections between the two Category 4 hurricanes that came barreling at the United States in recent weeks Harvey and Irma and climate change. When Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked about a link Monday she touted the country's environmental record and moved on. When Homeland Security Advisor Tom Bossert was asked as he preceded Huckabee Sanders in the briefing he wouldn't talk about climate change's cause. 'I will tell you that we continue to take seriously the climate change' he said. 'Not the cause of it but the things that we observe.' 'Causality is something outside my ability to analyze right now' Bossert also added. When President Trump was asked about it Sunday returning home to the White House from Camp David he simply ignored the reporter's query and walked inside. Climate scientists largely agree that the oceans are heating up leading to larger scarier hurricanes. At Monday's briefing Huckabee Sanders dismissed a climate change question noting that Trump had addressed the issue previously of whether he thought it was man made. In the past Trump has suggested climate change was a hoax created by the Chinese to choke American industry. In June he pulled the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Huckabee Sanders was also asked if Trump was re thinking that decision now. 'I'm not sure specifically on the Paris climate deal but as he said at the time the goal is to always do the very best when taking care of the environment and taking proper steps' Huckabee Sanders replied. 'The United States is one of the best in the world at doing this we want to continue to do that but right now the administration is focused on the recovery and the relief efforts and as Tom Bossert said a few minutes ago we'll look at that analysis once we get through the coming days and focus on the recovery and relief and saving life effort' Huckabee Sanders added. Bossert had suggested that the hurricanes be studied though also pointed out the cyclical nature of the seasons. 'And I think the scientists for the forecast on this particular one they were dead on that this would be a stronger more powerful hurricane season with slightly more than average large storms making landfall in the United States' he said. 'So we'll have to do a larger trend analysis at a later date' Bossert added. The Environmental Protection Agency's Scott Pruitt went one step further when asked about climate change Friday suggesting that it wasn't appropriate. 'To have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm versus helping people or actually facing the effect of the storm is misplaced' Pruitt said. Of course the scientific community as the New York Times put it believes that'drawing links between warming global temperatures and the ferocity of hurricanes is about as controversial as talking about geology after an earthquake.' But in politics it's become a heated issue that speaks to the current red versus blue divide. And while it's primarily Republicans who won't touch the global warming third rail that doesn't always hold true. On Sunday Sen. John McCain R Fla. who has preached bipartisanship in recent months on the heels of his cancer diagnosis told CNN's Jake Tapper that he didn't know why his Republican colleagues were denying climate change adding that it was 'time to sit down.' 'We have to understand that the climate may be changing and we can take common sense measures which will not harm the American people' McCain argued.	True	False	False	True	True
Upside down rivers of warm ocean water may be one of the causes of Antarctica's ice shelves breaking up leading to a rise in sea levels. A new study suggests that in the past increases in Antarctic sea ice in colder climates may have contributed to ice ages. Using computer simulations the research looked at past changes during the glacial periods and noted that previous increases in sea ice levels may have significantly altered the circulation of the ocean which led to a reverse greenhouse effect as carbon dioxide levels in the ocean increased and levels in the air decreased. One key question in the field is still what caused the Earth to periodically cycle in and out of ice ages University of Chicago professor and the study's co author Malte Jansen said in a statement. We are pretty confident that the carbon balance between the atmosphere and ocean must have changed but we dont quite know how or why. ANTARCTICA'S ICE SHEETS CONTAIN RADIOACTIVE CHLORINE GAS 60 YEARS AFTER NUCLEAR TESTS STUDY SAYS The last major ice age ended at the end of the Pleistocene epoch about 11700 years ago as glaciers have periodically grown and then gotten smaller. Researchers believe that changes to the Earth's orbit may be partly responsible for some of the Earth's cooling but additional factors have likely played a part Jensen added. The most plausible explanation is that there was some change in how carbon was divided between the atmosphere and the ocean Jansen continued. Theres no shortage of ideas about how this happens but its not quite clear how they all fit together. Researchers also believe a mini ice age may have occurred roughly 12800 years ago. It likely stems from an asteroid impact that rocked the Northern Hemisphere and led to the Younger Dryas climate event. Jansen pointed out that the Southern Ocean around Antarctica plays a key role in ocean circulation due to the deep waters in the region leading it to have outsized consequences. AIR POLLUTION MORE DEADLY THAN SMOKING NEW STUDY FINDS What this suggests is that its a feedback loop said the study's lead author Alice Marzocchi. As the temperature drops less carbon is released into the atmosphere which triggers more cooling. What surprised me is how much of this increased storage can be attributed to physical changes alone with Antarctic sea ice cover being the key player Marzocchi added noting that future study of the ocean and the role it plays in the carbon cycle can help simulate future environmental change. The research has been published in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience.

Taking hisprevious statementseven further Interior Secretary David Bernhardt told lawmakers Tuesday that he is not obligated to combat climate change because there is no law requiring that he do so. Bernhardt responded by noting that there are over 600 instances in the law directing the Interior Department secretary to do certain things including completing reports and making certain authorizations but he said there is no such mandate for addressing planetary warming. You know what theres not is a shall for I shall manage the land to stop climate change or something similar to that he said pointing the finger at Congress. The hearing was the first of two appearances Bernhardt has before Congress this week to defend the Trump administrations 2020 budget request which calls for a 14 cut in funding for the Department of the Interior. But a good portion of the discussion focused on climate change environmental protections and an ethics investigation against Bernhardt and several other agency officials. A sobering United Nations report released Monday found that up to 1 million species of land and marine species are at risk of extinction due to human actions. Neither Bernhardt nor the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service an agency he oversees and that is primarily responsible for safeguarding the nations imperiled species issued a statement about the report. Rep. Betty McCollum D Minn. the subcommittees chair quoted from the U.N. report and told Bernhardt the country is depending on you to help lead the fight along with us to combat these issues including the biodiversity and climate crises. She asked Bernhardt how he would incorporate the scientific findings into the agencys activities and asked if he would rethink the administrations push to boost domestic energy production. Are we going to stop oil and gas development because of this report? The answer to that is no Bernhardt said. Congress you all have the ability to decide whether we do anything on federal lands. ... If you have a view on what you want to happen well carry it out when you execute it. That is my position. Bernhardt a former oil and gas lobbyist who was confirmed as agency secretary last month told the subcommittee that he recognizes that the climate is changing that human beings are a contributing factor and that the agency is taking the threat into account in its decision making. A pair of dire reports released last year one from the United Nations and another from more than a dozen federal U.S. agencies warned that world governments are running out of time to stave off catastrophic climate change. Still the Trump administration has barreled ahead with its fossil fuel centric energy dominance agenda.Approximately one quarter of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions come from fossil fuel extraction on federal lands according to agovernment report released by the Trump administration in November. Bernhardt who brought with him to the job a slew of potential conflicts of interest from his days as an energy lobbyist also faced tough questions Tuesday about alleged ethics violations. Interiors internal watchdog recently opened two ethics probes the first of them just four days into Bernhardts tenure intomultiple high ranking interior officials including the secretary. Bernhardt stressed as he has before that he takes ethics extremely seriously is working to improve the agencys ethics program and is confident that he has complied with all rules and will be cleared at the end of the investigation.

A climate scientist and a former government expert in the audience for Donald Trumps annual address to Congress said this will probably be the last administration that can forgo talking about climate change in the State of the Union speech. Trump did not mention rising temperatures or extreme weather although he did tout the countrys status as the top producer of oil and gas and boast about how quickly his officials have moved to cut regulations. Lisa Graumlich the dean of the environment college at the University of Washington attended the State of the Union address as a guest of the Washington congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. I have been doing research on climate change since the 1970s and it always seemed very far away in time and space. It was something that was going to happen when peoples grandchildren were alive. And that has changed Graumlich said. I dont think that future presidents will find themselves in this position because people are feeling the effects of climate change. Joel Clement who resigned from the interior department because he said the administration was muzzling scientists and ignoring climate change effects on vulnerable communities now works with the Union of Concerned Scientists. He was invited by the Maine congressman Chellie Pingree. The Trump administrations strategy is to ignore climate change and pretend it doesnt exist and pretend the science doesnt exist even if its coming from its own agencies Clement said. To not say anything about it is just ignorance and its irresponsible. In 10 years Clement said climate change will be central to all policy discussions as one of the top three or four issues in the world Clement said. Several other high profile climate advocates were invited by other Democrats protesting against Trumps doubts of the science and his rollbacks. The New York congressman Paul Tonko invited the League of Conservation Voters Gene Karpinski and the Maryland congressman Jamie Raskin brought along 350.orgs Bill McKibben. The Massachusetts senator Ed Markey attended with the head of the youth led Sunrise Movement Varshini Prakash who is calling for a Green New Deal to tackle inequality and quickly cut greenhouse gas emissions. Markey is expected to join Alexandria Ocasio Cortez this week in releasing expanded language on the high level goals of a Green New Deal. Even the Democratic rebuttal to Trumps speech by the ex Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams only mentioned climate change once in a list of priorities the US could pursue. However Bernie Sanders in his own response speech noted warnings in reports from the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. How can a president of the United States give a State of the Union speech and not mention not one word about climate change when the leading scientists of the world tell us that climate change is real that climate change is caused by human activity that climate change is already causing devastating harm in the United States Sanders said. Furthermore the scientists tell us we have a very short 12 years not a lot of time in order to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels. While very little of the primetime speeches focused on climate change Democrats will hold two hearings in the House on Wednesday about its effects.	False	False	False	True	False
Humans are sleepwalking into a mass extinction of species not seen since the demise of the dinosaurs British scientists warned. Man made global change is threatening the diversity of different creatures that have taken millennia to evolve to live in niche habitats. Creatures that have moved into delicate ecosystems such as coral reefs often live in symbiosis with others and are the slowest to recover their diversity if damaged. But global warming and rising sea levels threatened to wipe out many species that cannot adapt to change quickly enough in a blink of an eye. In particular freshwater habitats are teeming with diverse birds and mammals but they are often form isolated pockets which are vulnerable to sudden change. Professor of Evolutionary Paleobiology Matthew Wills at the Milner Centre for Evolution at the University of Bath said We are sleepwalking into a mass extinction of a magnitude unparalleled since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. Astonishingly we know remarkably little about the physical and biological forces that shape patterns of diversity on a global scale. For example why are there over a million species of insects but only 32 species in their immediate sister group the little known remipedes? Diversity takes millions of years to evolve but can be damaged in the blink of an eye. We are already losing diversity that has never even been documented so it's vitally important to understand the mechanisms that drive evolution into new species. The scientists looked at how the humble caridean shrimp has evolved and diversified since it first appeared in the Lower Jurassic. There are now around 3500 species worldwide living in salt and fresh water habitats and are a vital component of the marine food chain and an important contribution to fisheries worldwide. Research Fellow Dr Katie Davis an evolutionary palaeobiologist at the University of York explained Understanding the processes that shaped the strikingly irregular distribution of species richness across the Tree of Life is a major research agenda. Changes in ecology may go some way to explain the often strongly asymmetrical fates of sister clades and we test this in the caridean shrimps. There are depending upon estimates between two and 50 million extant species of animals Metazoa all derived from a single common ancestral species that lived some 650 million years ago. Net rates of speciation therefore exceed rates of extinction but the balance of these processes varies greatly both between clades and throughout geological time. The scientists examined the patterns of diversity change across the crustaceans's evolutionary tree. By time calibrating the largest ever evolutionary tree for carideans against both fossil and molecular dates it was possible to explore where rates of diversification sped up and slowed down over the last 200 million years. They found the shrimp have independently transitioned from marine to freshwater habitats repeatedly creating much richer pockets of biodiversity. The relative isolation of lakes and rivers appear to increase the diversity of species in a similar way to Darwin's finches on island chains. But rising sea levels caused by climate change could put these pockets at risk disrupting these freshwater distributions and leading to extinctions as a result. By contrast many marine shrimp live in close symbiotic associations with a variety of other animals including corals and sponges which appears to have slowed their diversification rate. Symbioses are most common in shallow reef settings among the most diverse but notoriously delicately balanced and threatened marine ecosystems. The researchers said lower rates of diversification mean it will take longer for carideans to recover from the extinctions that are already inevitably underway. Co author Sammy de Grave head of research at the Oxford University Museum added The study was published in the journal Communications Biology.	False	False	False	False	False
More than 380 people have been confirmed dead after a tsunami triggered by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit an Indonesian city on Friday. Waves up to 3m 10ft high swept through Palu on Sulawesi island. Video on social media shows people screaming and fleeing in panic and a mosque among the buildings damaged. Strong aftershocks rocked the city on Saturday. Thousands of homes have collapsed along with hospitals hotels and a shopping centre. Rescue efforts are under way though hampered by a major power cut. The main road to Palu has been blocked due to a landslide and a key bridge is out of action. Indonesia's disaster agency said at least 384 people had been killed but the number is expected to rise. At least 540 have been injured and 29 are listed as missing. Many bodies were found along the shoreline because of the tsunami but the numbers are still unknown Sutopo Purwo Nugroho a spokesman for the agency told Reuters. When the threat arose yesterday people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims he told a news briefing. The tsunami didn't come by itself it dragged cars logs houses it hit everything on land. Some survived by climbing 6m 18ft trees to escape the huge waves the spokesman said. A less powerful quake earlier on Friday had killed at least one person and injured at least 10 in the smaller fishing town of Donggala. In Palu hundreds of people had been preparing for a beach festival that was due to start on Friday night. The city's main hospital was damaged in the quake and TV footage showed dozens of injured people being treated outside in makeshift medical tents. Palu and Donggala are home to more than 600000 people. President Joko Widodo said troops were en route to the area to reinforce rescue teams and help retrieve bodies. The main airport in Palu has been closed since the tsunami hit. A minister said the runway had been damaged but that it was hoped helicopters would still be able to land. The country's military is sending cargo planes of relief aid from the capital Jakarta. Officials are urging locals not to enter their homes and to sleep away from buildings due to the risk of aftershocks. The earthquake hit just off central Sulawesi at a depth of 10km 6.2 miles just before 1800 on Friday 1000 GMT the US Geological Survey said. A tsunami warning was issued but lifted within the hour. Indonesia's meteorological agency has been criticised for its response but officials said the waves struck while the warning was in place. Dramatic video of the tsunami hitting Palu shows the high waves sweeping away several buildings and then the large tilted mosque in the town about 80km from the quake's epicentre. The situation is chaotic people are running on the streets and buildings collapsed. There is a ship washed ashore said Dwikorita Karnawati head of Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency. A 2004 tsunami triggered by an earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra killed 226000 across the Indian Ocean including more than 120000 in Indonesia. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the Ring of Fire the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim. More than half of the world's active volcanoes above sea level are part of the ring. Just last month a series of deadly earthquakes struck the Indonesian island of Lombok. The biggest on 5 August killed more than 460 people. Have you been affected by the earthquake?

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke let the mask slip this week turning the subtext of his term in office backing fossil fuels into the headline as he spoke to a friendly audience. On Tuesday Zinke gave the keynote address at the Louisiana Oil and Gas Associations fall meeting in Lafayette Louisiana. He told the conference over lunch our government should work for you according to organizers You can debate what Zinke meant by work for you but many heard it as a pledge of allegiance to the industry. And according to the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association the industry members in the room were thrilled with the pledge giving Zinke a standing ovation. An organizer told me none of the speeches at the event were recorded. However environmental activists and some lawmakers were appalled by the statement. And then that evening Zinkes official Twitter account went into damage control mode implying the message was meant for a broader audience rather than just the industries hes supposed to regulate. But Zinke has said pretty much the same thing before. In March he told an energy industry conference Interior should not be in the business of being an adversary. We should be in the business of being a partner. For the record the Interior Departments job is to manage about 75 percent of federal public land which amounts to about one fifth of the total area of the United States. This means conservation preserving culture and facilitating recreation. It also entails leasing rights to mining drilling grazing and logging. However it does not mean that the agency needs to advance the fossil fuel industrys interests certainly not at the expense of the environment. But the Interior Department under Zinke has been pushing much harder to open up public lands to private companies while drastically rolling back its environmental responsibilities. Our mandate is multiple use of public lands and multiple use also includes the development of natural resources as we seek to leverage American energy for American strength Zinke wrote in the departments 2018 22 strategic plan. One place weve seen Zinke pick sides is in his response to Californias record wildfires. Rather than acknowledging the role of climate change in increasing fire risks he blamed environmental terrorist groups while calling for more private logging on public lands. Zinkes words have been loud but his actions have been even louder. Under Zinke weve seen the largest rollback of federal land protections in US history. He also opened nearly all US coastal waters to offshore oil and gas drilling preparing for the largest lease sale in US history. The National Park Service which is part of the Interior Department proposed more than doubling national park entrance fees before settling on increases of 5 to 10. The Bureau of Land Management also part of the Interior Department announced this week it was revising its rules on methane emissions from gas drilling on public lands. Interior is also pushing for more roads in wilderness areas dialing back conservation plans for wildlife and selling leases for Arctic oil and gas drilling. The agency canceled a study looking into the health impacts of coal mining and dismissed violations committed by coal companies. Taken together its pretty clear who Zinke is working for. However the Trump administration has the odd habit of stumbling over itself. President Donald Trumps trade war is already threatening to undo gains for the fossil fuel industry as China readies tariffs on US energy. Zinke himself tendencies exhibited by former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt that have invited scrutiny from lawmakers. Hes opaque with his schedule obscuring his dealings with the energy industry. He took a 12000 flight on an oil executives charter plane. He was involved in a land deal with the chair of Halliburton which may have violated conflict of interest rules. The Government Accountability Office had to end a probe in June into whether Zinke threatened Sen. Lisa Murkowski R AK over her vote on Obamacare because the Interior Department didnt cooperate. He also has his office fly a secretarial flag when hes in the building and minted his own challenge coin. With Pruitt no longer sucking the oxygen out of the room congressional Democrats are now eyeing Zinke and have promised more investigations of his conduct should they take control of the House in the fall. Zinke is one the most ethically challenged members of the Cabinet and maybe one of the most ethically challenged secretaries of the Interior weve had in living memory Rep. Gerry Connolly D VA who could chair the House Oversight Government Operations Subcommittee if Democrats win in November told Politico this week. Theres rich material here to look into his behavior and his fitness for continued service in the office.	False	False	False	False	False
The United States submitted a formal notification that it will withdraw from the Paris climate agreement Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Monday a move that has been widely expected since President Trump announced his intention to do so in 2017. The climate agreement which went into force Nov. 4 2016 committed countries that signed the measure to take certain voluntary steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The agreement was not legally enforceable and countries set their own emissions targets. The accord banned countries from announcing their intent to withdraw in its first three years meaning Monday was the first day the U.S. was allowed to submit its intent to leave the agreement since it went into force in 2016. President Trump made the decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement because of the unfair economic burden imposed on American workers businesses and taxpayers by U.S. pledges made under the Agreement Pompeo said in a statement. The United States has reduced all types of emissions even as we grow our economy and ensure our citizens access to affordable energy. LEONARDO DICAPRIO PRAISES GRETA THUNBERG AS 'A LEADER OF OUR TIME' Trump has previously said that the Paris climate agreement harms the U.S. economy and would hurt American jobs if left to stand. Compliance with the terms of the Paris accord and the onerous energy restrictions it has placed on the United States could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025 according to the National Economic Research Associates Trump said in the Rose Garden in 2017 when he announced plans to remove the U.S. from the accord. This includes 440000 fewer manufacturing jobs not what we need believe me this is not what we need including automobile jobs and the further decimation of vital American industries on which countless communities rely. They rely for so much and we would be giving them so little. Some opponents of the agreement have noted that countries such as Russia and China were not affected as significantly by the accord as the United States and pointed out the unencouraging results of the Kyoto Protocol raising questions about whether the Paris agreement would reduce global greenhouse gas emissions at all. GRETA THUNBERG TURNS DOWN ENVIRONMENTAL PRIZE SAYS 'CLIMATE MOVEMENT DOES NOT NEED ANY MORE AWARDS' Half of the countries that were legally bound to the Kyoto Protocol treaty failed to adhere to their pledges and the host country of Japan even increased their carbon emissions Sen. Jim Inhofe R Okla. said as the Paris climate agreement was being debated in 2016. Now we find ourselves celebrating an agreement where the worlds largest carbon emitter China is permitted to increase their emissions until 2025 and to continue bringing a coal fired power plant online every 10 days. We even turn a blind eye to the fact that China lied about its carbon emissions when it first came to the table with its pledge last year. Others however see America backing out of the international pact to limit greenhouse gas emissions as an abdication of global leadership and denial of basic climate science. By withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement to double down on a coal fossil fuel energy agenda Trump has engaged in a unilateral disarmament in the economic arms race that is the transition to clean energy said Michael Mann a climate scientist and professor at Penn State University. The challenge of averting dangerous and irreversible climate change and massive coastal inundation devastating floods and droughts is that much more an uphill climb with Trump's pullout from the Paris agreement. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In his statement Monday however Pompeo maintained that the United States was on the right track both economically and environmentally. Our results speak for themselves he wrote. U.S. emissions of criteria air pollutants that impact human health and the environment declined by 74 percent between 1970 and 2018. U.S. net greenhouse gas emissions dropped 13 percent from 2005 2017 even as our economy grew over 19 percent.	False	False	False	False	False
I actually did feel there was a real chance that he might come to his senses and stay in the Paris Agreement said Gore who has spent years in pursuit of action on climate change and on Tuesday joined CNN for a town hall moderated by Anderson Cooper. Gore met with Trump after the 2016 election at the invitation of Ivanka Trump and he spoke again with the President by phone in early May. But Gore's and Ivanka's influence clearly was not enough. After some delay Trump announced in the Rose Garden in June that he intended to pull the United States out of the climate agreement. Gore declined to get into the details of his private conversations with Trump but said those conversations had left him with reason to believe Trump would keep the United States in the agreement but added that thankfully his worst fears about the withdrawal were not realized. I was worried that other countries might use it as an excuse to pull out themselves Gore said. But I was gratified when the next day the entire rest of the world doubled down on the commitment to meet the terms of the Paris Agreement and then in this country so many governors and mayors and business leaders said 'We're still in.' Gore said that even with Trump's decision the United States could still manage to meet its own commitments under the Paris Agreement. The town hall featured people across the country who challenged Gore on the issue or asked his thoughts. Mayor James Eskridge of Tangier Island Virginia said his home town needed a sea wall to fight erosion but claimed sea level rise was not affecting them. I'm not a scientist but I'm a keen observer Eskridge said. And if sea level rise is occurring why am I not seeing signs of it? Earth to warm 2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century studies say Gore said he was aware of the town's situation and said the town was losing ground to rising seas. Tangier Island gained national prominence after Trump called Eskridge in response to a CNN piece on the town. Arguments about science aren't necessarily going to be of any comfort to you Gore said. Won't necessarily do you any good for me to tell you that the scientists do say the sea level is rising in the Chesapeake Bay and that you've lost about two thirds of your island already. Eskridge stood by his claim saying If I see sea level rise occurring I'll shout it from the house top. ... I'm just not seeing it. Gore said it was hard to translate what scientists said into something readily observable and believable. I try every day to figure out ways to do that he said. Gore warned there could be visible signs of a changing climate including stronger hurricanes due to rising ocean temperatures. As the oceans get warmer these ocean based storms get a lot stronger he said. There may not be more hurricanes but the ones that do come are on average likely to be much stronger. However Gore insisted that there is still time to act despite challenges that may lie ahead in adapting to what we can't avoid. We still have the ability to slow it down. We have the ability to prevent even worse sea level rise and and even worse catastrophes that are also caused by the climate crisis Gore said.	False	False	False	False	False
Reuters Climate change will cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century damaging everything from human health to infrastructure and agricultural production according to a government report issued on Friday. The Congressionally mandated report written with the help of more than a dozen U.S. government agencies and departments outlined the projected impacts of global warming in every corner of American society in a dire warning at odds with the Trump administrations pro fossil fuels agenda. With continued growth in emissions at historic rates annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century more than the current gross domestic product GDP of many U.S. states according to the report. It said global warming would disproportionately hurt the poor broadly undermine human health damage infrastructure limit the availability of water alter coastlines and boost costs in industries from farming to energy production. While it said that many of the impacts of climate change including more frequent and more powerful storms droughts and flooding are already underway the projections of further damage could change if greenhouse gas emissions are sharply curbed Future risks from climate change depend primarily on decisions made today it said. The report the Fourth National Climate Assessment Volume II supplements a study issued last year that concluded humans are the main driver of global warming and which warned of potentially catastrophic effects to the planet. The studies clash with policy under President Donald Trump who has been rolling back Obama era environmental and climate protections to maximize production of domestic fossil fuels including crude oil already the highest in the world above Saudi Arabia and Russia. Trump last year announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris Deal agreed by nearly 200 nations to combat climate change arguing the accord would hurt the U.S. economy and provide little tangible environmental benefit. Trump and several members of his cabinet have also repeatedly cast doubt on the science of climate change arguing the causes and impacts are not yet settled. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Environmental groups said the report reinforced their calls for the United States to take action on climate change. This report makes it clear that climate change is not some problem in the distant future. Its happening right now in every part of the country said Brenda Ekwurzel the director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists and one of the reports authors. Previous research including from U.S. government scientists has also concluded that climate change could have severe economic consequences including damage to infrastructure water supplies and agriculture. Severe weather and other impacts also increase the risk of disease transmission decrease air quality and can increase mental health problems among other effects. Thirteen government departments and agencies from the Agriculture Department to NASA were part of the committee that compiled the new report.

WASHINGTON Environmental advocates say now isthe time for decisive action on climate change. Democrats won the House in November riding a platformthat included a call to address the crisis. Global warming was blamed for intensifying natural disasters that killed dozens and cost billions of dollars across the country in 2018. Arecent avalanche of evidence that the climate is already changing radically has hardened the case for immediateaction. Climate change is here and now. And palpably getting worse. That is rapidly changing how Americans think about it David Doniger with the Natural Resources Defense Council wrote in a recent blog. The shift from 'future problem'to 'now crisis'is being fueled by blockbuster scientific reports and blockbuster real world catastrophes. And yetfew including Doniger expect Washingtonto do muchany time soon in the dramatic way scientistsare urging. President Donald Trump who in 2017 yanked the U.S. out of the Paris Accord on climate changecontinues to doubt the science and says radical action would only hurt the economy. At an international climate conference in Poland in December his emissariesdoubled down on the expansionof fossil fuels notably coal. And while incoming House Democratic leaders vow to make climate change a prioritywhen they take control Thursday their most ambitious proposals are expected to die in the GOP controlled Senate where Republicans remain resistant tofar reaching steps aimedat weaningthe nation off carbon. So for Democrats and their environmental allies the next two years in Washington are likely to be more about making a case to voters than actually scoring significant victories on climate change said Bob Shrum a longtime Democratic strategist who teaches political scienceat the University of Southern California. I don't think Trump's going to give an inch on this he said. I think we'll be at a stalemate for the next two years. But I think Democrats can prepare the ground can win the argument and can go into 2020 on these issues ina pretty strong position. Studies suggest there isn'tmuch time for politicking on the issue.Some of the effects are already taking place according to a landmark climate assessmentthe administration released in November. Climate change is contributing to extreme weather conditions the spread of new diseases by insects and pestsand changes to the availability of food and water the researchers say. But the dire warning has done little to prod Capitol Hill Republicans many of whom stillquestion the science behind climate change. Reluctant to cross Trump they barely discuss the issue these dayscompared to three years ago according to an analysis of press releases floor statements tweetsand Facebook posts by software firm Quorom. When Republicansdo talk about it therefrain is that innovation and incentive alone can solve the issue. One of the most notable achievements they toutwas passage of a tax credit to encourage the capture and storage of carbon emissions into the ground before they become airborne and contribute to global warming. More El Nios to strengthen because of global warming will cause 'more extreme weather' study says More Emissions of carbon dioxide into Earth's atmosphere reach record high But they roundly oppose dramatic steps such as a carbon taxto cut the nation off fossil fuels because it would increase the cost of energy. Wyoming GOP Sen. John Barrasso chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committeeand a sponsor of the carbon capture legislation opposes such punishing regulations. Making energy as clean as we can as fast as we can without raising costs to consumers will be accomplished through investment invention and innovation Barrasso wrote in a column for The New York Times. With carbon capture clean energy development and other advances the reliance on fossil fuels must stopas well if the planet has any hope of meeting the net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050 that scientists cite as a minimum to stave off the worst effects of a warming globe. That's a one two punch we need to solve the climate crisis said Conrad Schneider advocacy Director for the Clean Air Task Force a nonprofit organization pushing for carbon emission reduction. Neither alone is going to get it done. One of the few congressional Republicans willing to support a carbon tax is Florida Rep. Francis Rooney. Representing one of the country's reddest districts the former businessman from Oklahoma is a pro Trump conservative on most issues. But on climate change he is is an unflinching opponent largely because rising sea levels threaten his home state. I don't think we need to burn coal Rooney said. A carbon tax is the most market oriented nonbureaucratic efficient way I can see to kill off coal. And Rooney said the intransigence most of his fellow Republicans including President Trumpdisplay on the issue is harmful to the GOP brand and could come back to haunt them in 2020. We need to be reaching out to broaden our base and if you look at this last election our base is narrowing unfortunately he said. I talk to our kids and young people all the time and they are more environmentally sensitive they're more pro alternative energy they get the natural gas thing instead of coal. Tom Steyer the liberal California billionaire who is mulling a presidential run in 2020 believes climate change and Republicans' refusal to follow experts' advice despite the dire warnings will help Democratssweep into office two years from now. When we talk about what's at stake here we're talking about unimaginable suffering by the American people unless we solve the problem over the next 12 years he said recently. And I think that we're very far from doing that. And it is unclear to me that we can summon that will without having substantial political victories across the board.	False	False	False	False	False
Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt is expected to sign a proposed rule on Tuesday that would roll back a key piece of President Obamas climate legacy. But whats largely been lost in the conversation is how much the attempt to repeal the regulation on carbon dioxide emissions will impact peoples health. Pruitt wants to repeal Obamas Clean Power Plan the signature Environmental Protection Agency policy that aims to cut emissions from existing US power plants a big driver of climate change 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. While the big focus of the plan was reducing carbon emissions it also aimed to keep hundreds of thousands of tons of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution out of the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases are not only harmful to the environment but also increase the risk of everything from asthma to heart disease. The Clean Power Plan in other words though never implemented was a big win for health. According to the EPA cutting exposure to particle pollution in the order the CPP does would have averted up to 3600 premature deaths 90000 asthma attacks in children and 1700 heart attacks each year. Which means that the White Houses move to repeal the Clean Power Plan is a one two punch to human health and the environment said Georges Benjamin executive director of the American Public Health Association. Greenhouse gases are an enormous risk to human health. So this means well continue to be exposed to these gases which exacerbate asthma heart disease strokes. According to the Global Burden of Disease project more than 5 million people die worldwide each year because of air pollution and emissions from coal fired plants are a major risk factor here. Its one reason why health experts have been pushing policymakers to rapidly phase out of coal. For miners the immediate health risks include black lung disease and scarring of the lung tissue. But the pollutants emitted when coal is processed including sulfur dioxide particulate matter nitrogen oxides and mercury have much more far reaching effects on many more people. In one large study involving 450000 Americans followed between 1982 and 2004 researchers found that increased exposure to the particles in fossil fuel emissions increased the risk of death from heart disease and particles from coal burning were five times more damaging than other similar particles. Reducing emissions from coal fired power plants also makes it easier to breathe. Over the past 30 years the percentage of Americans with asthma has more than doubled and climate change has been a significant driver of that trend. Air pollution triggers asthma attacks contributing to lung abnormalities particularly in the developing pulmonary systems of children. For the White House bolstering the coal industry seems to trump these other matters. The war on coal is over Pruitt said Monday in Kentucky when he announced the move. For now the environmental community and some state governments are expected to oppose the rule in federal courts. The public health community should be there too. Health isnt a big part of the conversation about Trump administration assault on climate change mitigation policies but it needs to be. Its not just the future of the planet thats at stake here.

Donors to conservative candidates should also finance media projects that promote their values. Politics is downstream from culture is an aphorism the late conservative iconoclast Andrew Breitbart was famous for coining He believed that in the end the people who win elections are the ones telling the best stories and controlling the narrative on any issue. In 2016 Donald Trump won in part because Make America Great Again encapsulated a better story than Hillary Clintons tepid Stronger Together. But popular culture whether it be books TV film music or video games remain dominated by the Left. Sandwiched between much of our entertainment are messages that perpetuate liberal themes The military is bloodthirsty radical Muslims must be handled with kid gloves trial lawyers and climate change activists are crusading heroes and above all corporations are evil. When they are not being greedy or trying to dominate the world they are responsible for polluting the planet. Narratives like the ones above dont get turned into stories by accident. The Tides Foundation which featured Barack Obama on its board before he became president has spent nearly a billion dollars in the past 20 years serving as a cutout for liberal donors who dont want to be identified with a particular cause. One of the most touted projects it has steered donors to is Participant Media an activist entertainment company that produces movies with a message. Among the films Participant has championed are George Clooneys CIA conspiracy thrillers Al Gores climate change documentaries and a docudrama celebrating Ruth Bader Ginsburgs legal career. Another genre beloved by Participant filmmakers is the corporate polluter drama. Dark Waters a film in which a crusading trial lawyer is pitted against the DuPont chemical company is being released nationwide this month. Picking up where Erin Brockovich left off the film asserts that DuPont ignored the dangers posed by a group of chemicals PFAS that were used in nonstick cookware and firefighting. Trial lawyers sued DuPont in 2001 alleging that 80000 people in Ohio and West Virginia had been exposed to PFAS in their drinking water. The case dragged on for years until DuPont and Chemours Company which spun off from DuPont settled some 3500 injury lawsuits for a total of 671 million. No one doubts that there was real liability in the case but Dark Waters is a conspiracy horror movie that ignores facts to shake up its audience. A clear giveaway is that the movie begins with the disclaimer inspired by true events rather than the more commonly used based on a true story. The film ignores recent studies that have found no causal link between PFAS chemicals and infections or dental cavities. Also ignored that the Centers for Disease Control report that the blood levels of PFAS compounds in people have dropped dramatically since the 20 year old events depicted in the story. But the film has served as a springboard for calls to environmental activism. The House Oversight Committee conducted a hearing on PFAS issues last month. Dark Waters leading star Mark Ruffalo was the main witness. Ruffalo best known to filmgoers for playing the Incredible Hulk is an outspoken political extremist. This month he sent out a tweet calling for an economic revolution because in his view capitalism is failing us killing us and robbing from our childrens future. Hes even criticized liberal TV host Ellen DeGeneres for socializing with George W. Bush because the former president hasnt been brought to justice for the crimes of the Iraq War. The real agenda behind Dark Waters is to try to vilify chemical companies and characterize them as the next Big Tobacco. They can then be made a juicy target for both trial lawyers and government regulators. In a CNN interview last month Ruffalo directly linked the issues around PFAS to alleged attempts by government to hide science surrounding fossil fuels not to mention Exxon and climate change. But just last week a New York judge found Exxon not guilty of misleading shareholders on climate change blowing up Ruffalos straw man. The Exxon case shows that the agenda of the left wing groups behind Dark Waters is a moving target one always guided by the trial lawyers laser like focus on the deepest pocketbook. The Left has long understood the role that popular culture can play in shaping politics. Conservatives have largely ignored the radicalization of Hollywood in this struggle. Its time that many people who give money to conservative candidates recognize the need also to finance media projects that promote their values. One example is a proposed big budget biographical film about Ronald Reagan starring Dennis Quaid. Its producers are still searching for final financing before they begin production. If conservatives wind up losing elections and thereby ceding public policy to the Left they will have only themselves to blame for ignoring the war over popular culture that has been steering younger voters to think in more radical terms.

President Donald Trump's Earth Day message greatly differed in tone from his predecessor by not mentioning climate change. The president's statement focused on the beauty of nature and the importance of preserving it for future generations. He said in the second paragraph 'economic growth enhances environmental protection.' This point was reiterated later in a somewhat defensive tweet. Trump said 'I am committed to keeping our air and water clean but always remember that economic growth enhances environmental protection. Jobs matter!' By comparison last year President Obama's message in 2016 took on an urgent tone and said 'Human activity is disrupting the climate and the challenge of combating climate change is one that will define the contours of our time.' However Obama did not mention climate change in 2010 or 2012 statements important midterm and general election years according to AOL. President Bush also pointed to climate change in his 2009 Earth Day statement 'We are taking positive steps to confront the important challenge of climate change. Our work is not done.' President Trump's administration executive orders and tweets indicate he is not a believer in climate change. In 2013 on a chilly day at Trump Tower he tweeted 'Another freezing day in the Spring what is going on with global warming? Good move changing the name to climate change sad!' In a flurry of other tweets he criticized President Obama for prioritizing the environment over other issues such as 'ISIS and Ebola.' On Earth Day thousands of scientists students and research advocatesmarched around the world in protest of Trump's research budget cuts. Many of the signs at the rallies referenced climate change specifically. On Friday Trump asked the Surgeon General Dr Vivek Murthy to resign from his post.Murthy previously spoke out against climate changed and called it aserious danger to public health.

Sen. Bernie Sanders I Vt. upped the ante in his progressive agenda on Thursday when he signaled support forcriminal charges against executives at oil companies. Fossil fuel executives should be criminally prosecuted for the destruction they have knowingly caused Sanders tweeted. His comments were the latest in progressive politicians'long line of attacks on big corporations and their role in climate change. It came on the same day that he released a sweeping 16 trillion plan to address climate change. Sanders paintedhis Green New Dealas a way to end the greed of the fossil fuel industry. OCASIO CORTEZ 'THERE'S NO DEBATE' THAT FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION SHOULD STOP We are going to end the greed of the fossil fuel industry and move to 100 renewable energy he tweeted in an attack on natural gas. Sanders' website indicated that he would as president direct his Justice Department to pursue criminal charges against companies like Exxon. These executives have spent hundreds of millions of dollars protecting their profits at the expense of our future and they will do whatever it takes to squeeze every last penny out of the Earth his website reads. Bernie promises to go further than any other presidential candidate in history to end the fossil fuel industrys greedincluding by making the industry pay for its pollution and prosecuting it for the damage it has caused. The American Petroleum Institute a trade association for the oil and gas industry responded to Sanders in a statement to Fox News. Pitting important environmental goals against working families who rely on affordable American energy is a false choice the organization said. While some may use attacks on natural gas and oil to energize their political base our industry will remain focused on providing the energy that powers Americas economy and modern lifestyle while also continuing to lower carbon emissions beyond their current generational low. While Sanders' pledge seemed unprecedented left wing attacks on big oil are nothing new. Former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman led a coalition of more than a dozen states in investigating ExxonMobil over allegations it misled the public about climate change. That turned into a federal lawsuit alleging the oil giant defrauded its shareholders with its messaging on climate change.Schneiderman resigned in 2018 amid allegations of physical abuse but legal battles continued to swirl around the company. Sanders' plan along with other Democratic climate change proposals wouldlikely inflict a heavy financial toll on companies like Exxon as Democrats embraced timelines that would drastically reduce carbon emissions within just decades of implementation. Congressional Democrats have for example proposed a carbon tax as a way to cut carbon emissions by 100 percent by 2050. The bill would purportedlyrebatea majority 70 percent ofrevenues from the tax to low and middle income Americans as a monthly dividend while spending the rest on infrastructure energy innovation and helping communities transition to a cleaner energy economy. The right leaning Competitive Enterprise Institute indicatedthat businesses would collectively face trillions of dollars in costs as they upgraded commercial and industrial buildings. For example the study found that the battleground state of Pennsylvania would face over 2 trillion in costs for upgrading residential commercialand industrial buildings. Florida would encounter a 1.4 trillion price tag andNew Hampshire the first primary state would face 102.8 billion in retrofitting costs. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sanders andothers have claimed their plans would benefit the economy. The Vermont senator predicted his plan would create 20 million jobs and pay for itself over 15 years. The cost of inaction is unacceptable Sanders' website claimed. Economists estimate that if we do not take action we will lose 34.5 trillion in economic activity by the end of the century. And the benefits are enormous by taking bold and decisive action we will save 2.9 trillion over 10 years 21 trillion over 30 years and 70.4 trillion over 80 years. 	False	False	False	False	False
U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Thursday openly dismissed concerns raised by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson about President Donald Trump's decision to exit the Paris Climate Treaty. Tillerson a former ExxonMobil CEO told senators during his January confirmation hearing that the U.S. should stay engaged in global warming mitigation instead of walking away. 'It's important that the U.S. maintains its seat at the table about how to address the threat of climate change which does require a global response' Tillerson said then. And he has fretted privately to confidants that withdrawing from the Paris deal could both undercut America's credibility on other multilateral agreements and impair relationships with foreign allies. The U.S. commerce chief told Fox News just minutes after Trump blasted the climate agreement as a wealth transfer gimmick that Tillerson is wrong. 'I have a great deal of respect for Secretary Tillerson. I happen to disagree strongly with him on this particular issue.' He added that 'I just don't see the connection frankly' between the Paris pullout and America's trustworthiness in future negotiations. 'I don't agree with that at all. There's no reason to make one agreement connect with another' Ross said using the Trans Pacific Partnership as Exhibit A. 'The sky didn't fall when we pulled out of TPP and the sky certainly won't fall now that we've pulled out of the Paris Accord' he said. 'I think the president is right.' Ross said much of the predicted backlash from other countries that drive global warming concerns would be rooted in economics not science. 'Any time that people were taking money out of your pocket and you make them put it back in they're not going to be happy. And that's what's happening here' he said. 'This wasn't about climate. It was about U.S. money going to other countries.' Ross has firmly rooted himself in the train of thought that sees climate change agreements as thinly veiled pretexts for demanding global payouts from Washington and a free ride for its trade adversaries. 'The president made clear we already are far ahead of other countries in terms of CO2 reduction' Ross said describing U.S. efforts to reduce carbon outputs. 'And how can it be an effective deal when it allows China and India two of the major polluters to keep increasing their pollution for another decade or two?' 'That doesn't sound to me like a climate accord' he said. 'It simply sounds like a transfer of wealth from the United States to other countries.' Tillerson on the other hand has aggressively pushed for greater recognition of America's obligation to lead the charge. Three weeks ago he signed an international document establishing the importance of the Paris Treaty in tackling climate change. The Fairbanks Declaration was adopted at the meeting by the members of the Arctic Council whose members like the U.S. have territory above the Arctic Circle. The declaration says that the Arctic 'is warming at more than twice the rate of the global average resulting in widespread social environmental and economic impacts in the Arctic and worldwide.' Last year just one day before Trump was elected Tillerson told a conference in Abu Dhabi that 'at ExxonMobil we share the view that the risks of climate change are serious and warrant thoughtful action. Addressing these risks requires broad based practical solutions around the world.' 'Importantly as a result of the Paris agreement both developed and developing countries are now working together to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions' he said then 'while recognizing differing national responsibilities capacities and circumstances.' Tillerson who met with the president on Wednesday in a last ditch effort to change his mind about pulling out of the Paris Accord did not attend Thursday's Rose Garden announcement that America's participation was at an end.

Atlantic hurricane season has reached its peak and as Florida deals with devastation wrought by Irma RT takes a look at where the phenomena come from and if they are really becoming more frequent? The 2017 hurricane season has already seen Texas rocked by Harvey and Florida battered by Irma and there are concerns that Jose which is currently lashing the Caribbean could hit the US east coast. While September is the most active month for hurricanes worldwide the North Atlantic hurricane season is set to continue until November 30 raising the question where are these monster storms originating? READ MORE 4 dead as Hurricane Irma rocks Florida leaving 3.5mn without power PHOTOS VIDEOS Most of the major hurricanes that have impacted the US originated in Cape Verde a nation on a volcanic archipelago off the northwest coast of Africa according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA. The interaction between the hot dry air of the Sahara Desert and the cooler more humid air from the Gulf of Guinea below creates high altitude winds known as the African Easterly Jet. Blowing from east to west across Africa the winds form clusters of thunderstorms once the waves of air have enough moisture lift and instability. The storms typically form every two to three days in a region near Cape Verde but it is not until the period between summer and autumn that conditions become favorable for the development of tropical cyclones. Tropical waves of air interact with the warm equatorial water of the Atlantic as they head west prompting columns of warm moist air to rise from the ocean and create an ideal environment to develop into a full blown hurricane. However if the Saharan Air Layer commonly known as Saharan dust is in the vicinity at the time it can weaken tropical cyclones over the Atlantic. This very dry air is most likely to have an impact in July and early August Dr Gerry Bell a hurricane climate specialist with NOAA told RT.com. This is when atmospheric conditions are only marginally conducive if at all for tropical storm formation. Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Andrew began life as tropical waves off the coast of west Africa. Irma was first spotted as a tropical disturbance off the Cape Verde Islands in late August before becoming a hurricane over the Atlantic as it moved west. Cape Verde hurricanes are known for being particularly large and intense however not all hurricanes hitting the US originate here Harvey evolved from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean Sea. A 2015 study examining the relationship between West African tropical disturbances and Atlantic hurricanes found that the larger an area covered by the disturbances was the more likely it would develop into a hurricane only one to two weeks later. Is the US getting hit more frequently by hurricanes? Hurricane seasons have generally been longer since 1995 according to Bell which he says is consistent with a high activity era. The season lengths since 1995 are comparable to those during the last active era of the 1950s 1960s. A study published in Nature last year led by James Elsner a climate scientist and geographer at Florida State University found that while hurricanes were becoming more powerful they were also becoming less frequent. However there appears to be little consensus among scientific researchers. An early draft of the government publication the US Climate Science Special Report published by the New York Times notes an observed upward trend in North Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s. The NOAA Geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory meanwhile says it is too early to conclude that global warming has already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane or global tropical cyclone activity. However expects it to result in more intense tropical cyclones globally with substantially higher rainfall rates by the end of the 21st century. It notes however that there is little evidence to suggest that climate change will lead to a large increase in numbers of tropical storms or overall hurricanes in the Atlantic.

Democrats vying for president revealed a fundamental split over how aggressively the US should tackle climate change in a seven hour town hall meeting on Wednesday. Bernie Sanders painted an apocalyptic future wreaked by the climate crisis and pledged to wage war on the fossil fuel industry. A high energy Elizabeth Warren urged optimism for building a better America and the former vice president Joe Biden who has a pitched a more moderate proposal said he would push other nations to recommit to stronger action. Sanders said without radical change the world will be uninhabitable. The damage to the world will be irreparable the Vermont senator said adding that he is proposing the largest most comprehensive climate plan presented by any presidential candidate in the history of the United States. With many questions focused on what candidates would ask Americans to sacrifice Elizabeth Warren pushed back on the framing. Asked if the government should tell people what kind of lightbulbs they can have the Massachusetts senator quipped Oh come on give me a break! There are a lot of ways that we try to change our energy consumption and our pollution she said. Some of it is with lightbulbs some of it is on straws some of it dang is on cheeseburgers. But most of the responsibility lies with industry not individuals she said adding this is exactly what the fossil fuel industry wants us to talk about. Biden meanwhile pitched himself as the candidate who could lead negotiations with the diplomatic might of the US. He said his first step as president would be to call an international meeting to strengthen the Paris climate agreement. We should be organizing the world demanding change we need a diplomat in chief Biden said. Look whats happening now in the Amazon whats going on? Nothing. Biden who critics say has one of the less progressive climate plans also got grilled on his plans to attend a fundraiser hosted by the founder of a natural gas company. He claimed the supporter is not a corporate executive. Where Biden would invest 1.7tn to fight climate change Warren proposed 10tn and Sanders would put forward 16.3tn setting them widely apart. The Democrats faced questions on whether their proposals would ban fracking for natural gas prohibit exports of oil gas and coal change nutritional guidelines to limit meat consumption and transition to all electric vehicles. Their answers and reactions to them foreshadowed the fight ahead with conservatives and industry regardless of who becomes the next president. Donald Trump in a thread on Twitter charged that Democrat plans will raise your energy bill and prices at the pump. The fossil fuels industry through the oil trade group the American Petroleum Institute and the American Energy Alliance said the plans would hurt poor Americans. Tonight while American families worry about making ends meet the Democrats running for president will be working hard to outbid each other on who can raise electricity and gasoline prices the highest and the fastest the alliance said in an emailed statement. The event was perhaps the longest stretch of primetime television ever dedicated to climate change held after the Democratic National Committee refused to sanction an official climate debate between candidates and amid unprecedented pressure from young activists and the Democratic voting base to tackle the climate crisis. On Wednesday a list of demands was released by a coalition of youth led groups whose lodestar is Greta Thunberg the Swedish teenager and activist who sparked a global wave of walkouts by school students over the climate crisis. Thunberg arrived in New York last week after crossing the Atlantic in a solar powered yacht for an upcoming UN climate summit. According to Yale University polling the climate emergency is now the second most important voting issue for Democrats behind healthcare. Among all voting Americans nearly seven in 10 are worried about climate change the highest ever recorded level of concern. There are strong bipartisan majorities in favour of setting pollution limits on industry businesses cars and trucks. Donald Trump who is dismantling rules aimed at lowering planet warming gases attacked the Democratic candidates for proposing unrealistic costly plans. The Democrats destructive environmental proposals will raise your energy bill and prices at the pump the president wrote on Twitter. Dont the Democrats care about fighting American poverty? Trumps campaign quickly took the opportunity to post a clip of California senator Kamala Harris saying she would ban plastic straws alongside an ad for Trump branded straws. But some young conservatives have raised concerns that Republican intransigence over the climate crisis will cost the party a generation of voters. Recent Newsy Ipsos polling found that 59 of millennial and Generation Z Republicans support the Green New Deal. There are a lot of young people who are conservative and believe in climate change They will not vote for a Republican if theyre voting on this issue said Benjamin Backer founder of the American Conservation Coalition which proposes action on the climate crisis. And I think thats a problem with the lack of involvement from the Republican Party on this issue for the past 10 years.	False	False	False	False	False
The U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA is actively trying to muzzle and minimize scientific reports warning about the impacts of climate change according to a Monday Politico report. The research Trump officials are trying to keep hidden could help farmers deal with the impact of climate change such as how climate change affects the protein in wheat fed to cattle or how changes in carbon dioxide levels alters the nutrients in rice. But rather than promote such peer reviewed research by the USDA's Agricultural Research Service ARS the agency refuses to even issue press releases. In one instance about research on rice the agency tried to dissuade a research partner the University of Washington from publicly discussing research. It was so unusual to have an agency basically say 'Don't do a press release' Jeff Hodson a communications director at the university told Politico. We stand for spreading the word about the science we do especially when it has a potential impact on millions and millions of people. Research from Politico showed the USDA did not attempt any promotion or press releases for 45 ARS studies that mentioned climate change. The intent is to try to suppress a message in this case the increasing danger of human caused climate change said Michael Mann a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. Who loses out? The people who are already suffering the impacts of sea level rise and unprecedented super storms droughts wildfires and heat waves. Anti science censorship has become a hallmark of the Trump administration. In August 2018 a survey of 63000 government scientists warned that censorship has been a problem in the Trump administration from the beginning. When a multi agency report on climate change was released in November 2018 Trump's EPA administrator Andrew Wheeler complained that it had too much science in it. As recently as June the Trump administration prevented a scientist from writing about climate change in testimony before Congress because it didn't jibe with the administration's view on the topic. Trump has been clear that he does not believe in the sound science behind climate change writing it off as a hoax. Trump said he didn't believe the multi agency scientific report about climate change noted above. Trump has also chosen fellow climate change skeptics for the highest levels of his administration including Sonny Perdue who leads the Department of Agriculture. In May career government economists accused Perdue and his agency of retaliating against them for their reports showing that Trump's tax and farm subsidy policies are hurting the very rural voters he promised to help. Now farmers may also feel the brunt of the pain from not receiving information about how to cope with the changing environment. Perdue refused to comment on this latest report that his agency is suppressing scientific research. If you're taking a certain block of research and not communicating it it defeats the purpose of why USDA does the research in the first place Robert Bonnie who worked at USDA during President Obama's administration told Politico. Rather than embrace science the Trump administration is hurting farmers in order to cling to an anti science political position. Published with permission of The American Independent.

At least eighteen environmental groups filed four lawsuits in one day against the Trump administration including suits to keep in place Obama era environmental policies. Environmentalists filed their suit Wednesday. Theyare living up to threats made after President Donald Trump took office namely to use the courts to preserve Obama administration policies. These include orders that stop offshore drilling and force the closure of coal plants. The League of Conservation Voters LCV led eight other groups in a legal challengeof Trumps recent executive order to reopen large swaths of Arctic seas to offshore drilling.LCV is one of the many environmental groups that endorsed Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election. Never in LCVs history have we taken this step Gene Karpinski LCVs president said in a statement. The permanent protections President Obama established for the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans were won with years of research lobbying and organizing. The suit argues Obama used his authority Section 12a of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to put most Arctic waters off limits to development. The act does not allow future presidents to undo placing waters off limits activists argue. The same day Earthjustice and the Center for Biological Diversity CBD filed suits to challenge the administration. Earthjustice sued to stop the Environmental Protection Agencys EPA decision to indefinitely stay the implementation of wastewater discharge rules for coal plants. CBD filed suit against EPA for not finalizing deadlines for the cities of Washington D.C. and Philadelphia to meet ozone standards. CBD also sued for Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitts emails and schedule. Earthjustice and CBD joined LCVs suit against Trumps EPA. So far CBD has filed 15 lawsuits against the administration something which the activist group publicly brags about. CBD famously sued the Department of Homeland Security DHS to stop the construction of a wall on the U.S. Mexico border. CBD wants the court to force DHS to conduct a programmatic environmental impact statement on border enforcement operations. Trump can expect more lawsuits as he continues to rollback Obama era policies. Environmentalists spent years lobbying and campaigning to get such policies in place. The Natural Resources Defense Council NRDC for example played a pivotal role in crafting the Clean Power Plan which became Obamas signature global warming policy. But Trump ordered EPA to review the Clean Power Plan asking the agency to see if it needed to be modified or rescinded. NRDC and other environmental groups were already locked in legal battles to keep the power plant rule from being overturned. NRDC has filed its fair share of lawsuits against Trump as well. They filed two lawsuits against the administration in February to keep the EPA from withdrawing a mercury rule and to oppose an executive order requiring agencies to repeal two regulations for every new one imposed. In March NRDC and other environmentalists sued to block the Keystone XL oil pipeline from being built. Theyalso tried to intervene in a lawsuit against a national ocean monument Obama created. The group filed at least two lawsuits in April challenging Trumps delaying energy efficiency standards for appliances and the administrations refusal to ban certain pesticides. NRDC attorneys are also representing LCV and others in the suit to keep Arctic waters off limits to drilling. Were President Trump able to get away with this the country would lose an important tool for protecting its vital interest in clean and vibrant oceans and coasts Niel Lawrence NRDCs Alaska director told Bloomberg. By now its clear there is no legitimate public interest in further expanding risk to our oceans in pursuit of fossil fuels that we dont need Lawrence said.

In the next few weeksCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom is slated to announce his administrations energy policy strategy and many environmental groups thereare hopingit will include plans to end oil and gas drilling in the nations most populous state and phase out all fossil fuel extraction. At the very least green groups are hoping that Newsom who campaigned last year on a promise to end controversial extraction methods like fracking and who has been a key figure in the fight to curtail climate change will create buffer zones for any new oil and gas wells near schools hospitals and residential neighborhoods and also monitor for dangerous emissions from plugged or abandoned wells. I consider to remain optimistic given how he expressed interest in issues that former California Gov. Jerry Brown did not address Kathryn Phillips the director of the Sierra Club California told Fox News. The governor needs to make a plan to transition the state away from oil and gas toward renewables but also transition workers into jobs in that sector. But as Newsoms term in Sacramento approaches its fifth month many of these groups are losing patience as the governor tries to balance a clean energy agenda with the demands of an industry that supports hundreds of thousands of jobs in a state with around 26 million vehicles on the road. Im taking a very pragmatic look at it in scoping this Newsom told The Los Angeles Times recently. Its also an inclusive scoping because it includes people in the industry that have jobs communities that are impacted from an environmental justice prism but also from an economic justice prism. Its a challenging issue. Newsom must now weigh the support he received from environmental groups while on the campaign trail and his own assurances that he wants California to be powered 100 percent by renewable energy in the near future with any moves that could negatively affect a billion dollar industry in a state that has the worlds fifth largest economy. Even with Californias oil production being in decline for years the state was the nations fifth largest domestic crude oil producerin 2017 according to figures compiled by the federal government. His intentions are very pragmatic Catherine Reheis Boyd the president of the Western States Petroleum Association told Fox News. Newsomunderstands the importance of an industry to the 40 million people who will be driving 26 million combustible engines tomorrow. One practice that environmental groups are hoping Newsom will clamp down on more than his predecessor is hydraulic fracturing. Known more popularly as fracking it is a method of oil and gas extraction in which large volumes of high pressure water are shot into the ground. Fracking has come under intense scrutiny in recent years amid widespread concerns over both the public health and environmental risks it poses. While Brown approved restrictions on the practice back in 2013 he was lambasted by green groups for not banning fracking outright amid his argument that it could provide economic opportunities to some Californians. On the campaign trail last year Newsom was adamantly opposed to fracking but has so far remained quiet about the practice along with the possibility of banning offshore drilling in the state when discussing his energy agenda. Newsom however told the Los Angeles Times that despite his commitment to renewable energies it would be impossible to completely stop Californias reliance on fossil fuels at the moment. One cannot just turn off the switch. One cannot just immediately abut against a century of practice and policy Newsom said. Still California is one of the nations leaders in pushing forth a green energy agenda. Despite the criticism leveled against him for waffling on clamping down on the fossil fuel industry Brown last year signed two pieces of legislation that effectively banned the construction of any new offshore oil and gas pipelines in the states waters and thwarted a Trump administration plan to open nearly 1.7 billion acres of coastal waters to drilling. While California cannot directly block oil and gas drilling off its coast the legislation that Brown signed aims to drive up the operating costs of these operations enough to make the effort unprofitable. Thelaw does this by blocking state land managers from permitting the construction of new pipelines piers wharves or other infrastructure projects necessary to bring oil and gas from offshore drilling sites to land. California has positioned itself as the center of the Trump resistance Jessica Levinson a clinical law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles told Fox News. Its bloody combat. California banned offshore drilling in state waters out to three miles back in 1994 and there havent been any new platforms built in the last 30 years. But California is the nations third largest oil producing state behind Texas and North Dakota and there are still 32 offshore oil platforms and artificial islands in federal and state waters off the coasts of Santa Barbara Ventura Los Angeles and Orange Counties. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP California may be leading the nation in curbing its reliance on fossil fuels and many environmental activists believe Newsom will take even bolder steps than his predecessor energy industry insiders like Reheis Boyd question what the point is when other states and nations are not doing their part as well. I get the idea of taking a lead on this issue and I think many companies agree with this she said. But at what cost is this being done especially when nobody else is doing anything.

Perpetual presidential candidate Bernie Sanders continues his Gimme tour with more and more promises to steal from the poor to give to the rich. This week Bernie met Britta. Britta is concerned about climate change in particular you nasty vile carnivores out there. Britta used her one opportunity to quiz a presidential candidate to ask aboutmeat. Okay. Okay. One second while I get my question. Okay so as you probably know animal agriculture is to blame for the majority of climate change and is the leading cause of deforestation water and air pollution and biodiversity loss. With that being known what do you plan on doing to ensure that Americans limit their consumption of animal products? Climate change is the leading cause of every bad thing on the earth is one hell of a You probably already know Britta. Got any facts to back that up or are we just making assumptions? Because as the great Samuel L. Jackson once uttered on film Never make assumptions. They only end up making an ass out of u and mption'. But Britta doesnt stop there. She goes on to cite Germany as a shining example of who we should want to be like. You may be completely shocked to learn that Bernie Sanders responded by affirming that indeed America needs to be more like the nation that brought us Hitler the Holocaust and the VW Bug only one of those things is good by the way. In case you needed some clarity. Sanders did not say outright that a meat tax is an official policy of his platform but he did give it the old politician shine indicating that he would support such a notion and that also hes interested in helping farmers become more aggressive about combatting climate change. Yes Im sure farmers will be very excited for your help which will be tantamount to them giving up their land their livestock and their livelihood effectively causing a nationwide famine but heysocialists got to socialist. Thank you for the question and its a good question. All I can say is if we believe as I do and you do that climate change is real were going to have to tackle it in every single area including agriculture. Okay? And in fact one of the things we want to do with our farmers out there is help them become more aggressive and able to help us combat climate change rather than contribute to it. So we will certainly youre right weve got to look at agriculture weve got to look at every cause of the crisis that we face. No word yet on if Sanders will be getting equally aggressive with his own multiple vacation properties.	False	False	False	False	False
