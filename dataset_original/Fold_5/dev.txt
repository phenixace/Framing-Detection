A strong tsunami triggered by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake has hit a coastal Indonesian city officials say. Waves of up to 2m 6.6ft high swept through Palu on Sulawesi island not long after authorities had lifted a tsunami warning. Video on social media shows people screaming and fleeing in panic and a mosque amongst the buildings damaged. Officials have reported five deaths but it is not clear if those were as a result of the tsunami. Last month a series of earthquakes struck the Indonesian island of Lombok killing hundreds of people the biggest on 5 August killed more than 460. The earthquake hit just off central Sulawesi at a depth of 10km 6.2 miles just before 1800 1100 GMT the US Geological Survey said. A tsunami warning was issued but lifted within the hour. The dramatic video footage of the tsunami hitting Palu shows the high waves sweeping away several buildings and then the large tilted mosque in the town about 80km from the quake's epicentre. Dwikorita Karnawati head of Indonesia's meteorology and geophysics agency BMKG said the tsunami had receded. The situation is chaotic people are running on the streets and buildings collapsed. There is a ship washed ashore she added. The 2004 tsunami triggered by an earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra killed 226000 across the Indian Ocean including more than 120000 in Indonesia. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because it lies on the Ring of Fire the line of frequent quakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific rim. More than half of the world's active volcanoes above sea level are part of the ring.	False	True	False	True	True
Democratic 2020 hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders on Thursday released his plan for a Green New Deal promising that the multitrillion dollarplan to radically overhaul the economy and combat climate change will pay for itself over the next 15 years. As president Bernie Sanders will launch the decade of the Green New Deal a ten year nationwide mobilization centered around justice and equity during which climate change will be factored into virtually every area of policy from immigration to trade to foreign policy and beyond his campaign said in a press release. SANDERS CALLS FOR 'REGISTRY OF DISREPUTABLE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS' CUTTING PRISON POPULATION IN HALF The Vermont senator has long been an advocate for the Green New Deal but only this year has it become a central policy for many of those seeking the Democratic nomination for president. This year it was given a big push in Congress when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D N.Y. and Sen. Ed Markey D Mass. introduced a formal resolution on it which stalled in the Senate but drewsupport from a number of 2020 hopefuls. All versions of such plans have gone beyond direct energy related policies instead seeking to overhaul the economy and society at large. Sanders plan is no different promising that he will generate the political will necessary for a wholesale transformation of our society and proposing16.3 trillion in public investments. In addition to promises that include reaching 100 percent renewable energy by 2030 and decarbonization by 2050 and ending unemployment by creating 20 million good paying jobs tied to clean energy Sanders claims he will save families money with a host of policies including launching universal high speed Internet weatherizing homes building new public transportation and rebuilding Americas infrastructure. Among those promises are a 681 billion program for families and small businesses to trade in old vehicles for newer more energy efficient motors a souped up version of the Obama administration era Cash for Clunkers program. He also promises justice for frontline communities via a 40 billion Climate Justice Resiliency Fund as well as an extra 200 billion to the Green Climate Fund. The plan also promises support for the climate justice movement to take on the fossil fuel industry and other polluters and lead the globe in solving the climate crisis. In a nod to the social justice part of the plan he says that the deal is an opportunity to uproot historical injustices and inequities to advance social racial and economic justice including redressing the exclusion of black brown Native Americanand other vulnerable communities from the programs that made up the original New Deal. But the White House hopeful also promises that the plan will pay for itself over 16 years sayingexperts have scored the plan and its economic effects. According to the campaign revenue will be generated via a host of measures including slapping the fossil fuel industry with fees litigation and taxes and generating revenue from the sale of energy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Further sources of revenue or savings includetax revenue from the proposed 20 million jobs higher taxes on the wealthy lower military spending and a reduced need for welfare spending due to the creation of millions of good paying unionized jobs. Any such plan is unlikely to get any Republican support and would almost certainly rely entirely on Democrats having strong majorities in both the House and Senate should Sanders win the nomination and the presidency.

President Donald Trump announced his decision to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord at 3 pm Eastern in the White House Rose Garden. A live stream of the announcement is embedded above. Multiple reports indicate that Trump is likely to announce a withdrawal from the agreement though many of these reports have expressed at least some uncertainty including about precisely what language Trump would use. Jonathan Swan of Axios reported that per two sources with direct knowledge of the decision Trump has decided to pull out of the agreement. The Daily Beasts Lachlan Markay reports that the White House is telling congressional staff that Trump will pull out. The Associated Presss Jill Colvin and Julie Pace though report that Trumps decision may not be entirely clear cut and that aides continued to deliberate on caveats in the language. The actual Paris deal agreed to by 195 countries in December 2015 is aspirational rather than binding calling on countries to set goals for emissions reduction. Still the withdrawal of the US would send an unmistakable signal to the rest of the world that the country with the second highest carbon emissions is no longer interested in even pretending to care about reducing them. For years now its been clear that blocking environmental regulations and obstructing action on climate change are top Republican Party priorities. The GOPs leading politicians and media outlets have tended to praise fossil fuel companies and ignore or cast doubt on climate science. The major Republican presidential candidates harshly criticized the Paris deal in particular and Trump promised to withdraw from it during the campaign. Still withdrawing from such a recent agreement that the vast majority of countries across the world have signed on to has serious consequences for Americas role as a global leader. So the question of whether the US should actually pull out of the agreement has reportedly been the subject of intense debate within the Trump administration. According to Politicos Andrew Restuccia and Josh Dawsey White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt have been the leading voices urging Trump to withdraw while Ivanka Trump and the so called New York or globalist White House camp have been advocating for staying in. Silicon Valley business leaders like Apple CEO Tim Cook and Tesla CEO Elon Musk have also been arguing that the US should stick to the agreement.	True	False	False	True	False
Fans of Greta Thunberg have expressed relief after the 16 year old posted a string of smiling photographs on Instagram. The environmental activist's recent images taken while touring Canada's east coast in Montreal and Quebec are in sharp contrast to images of the 16 year old speaking in an emotionally charged appearance last month at the Climate Action Summit 2019 in New York. A photo of Greta scowling when she spotted Donald Trumpwent viral. The teenage campaigner who has 7.2million followers on Instagram looks decidedly happier since she crossed the border from the US something which her followers haven't failed to notice. Writing on Instagram Greta said 'So happy to say that the following weeks I'll travel slowly through the North American continent moving southwest and then eventually through South America towards Santiago. I will stop on the way and visit as many places as I can and of course protest every Friday no matter where I am.' Yesterday the teenager posted an image of herself at theMarine Mammal Interpretation Centre in Tadoussac Qubec after spending a morning watchingwhales. The tone of Greta's images have changed significantly since she addressed the United Nations Climate Summit on September 23rd where she came close to tears in a emotional speech to international delegates. She told them 'I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us for hope. How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words' During the same appearance Greta was seen at the UN headquarters with an enraged expression on her face as US President Donald Trump upstaged her entrance by walking in flanked by news reporters an image that promptly went viral. Among the comments posted by the environmentalist's followers many remarked how much happier the teenager had looked in recent days. On Instagram Jesuissuzette wrote 'Greta you look so much happier now that youre out of America. Enjoy your travels. And thank you for your intrepid Climate Crisis campaign.' Last week Thunberg addressed on social media the negativity she's received for speaking out on climate change saying 'Here we go again... As you may have noticed the haters are as active as ever going after me my looks my clothes my behaviour and my differences. They come up with every thinkable lie and conspiracy theory. It seems they will cross every possible line to avert the focus since they are so desperate not to talk about the climate and ecological crisis. Being different is not an illness and the current best available science is not opinions its facts.' Greta who is taking a sabbatical year from school arrived in North America in August taking a two week crossing on carbon neutral yacht Malizia II to address the United Nations. Greta Thunberg's fiery speech at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York This is all wrong. I shouldnt be standing here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to me for hope? How dare you! You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. And yet Im one of the lucky ones. People are suffering. People are dying. Entire ecosystems are collapsing. We are in the beginning of a mass extinction. And all you can talk about is money and fairytales of eternal economic growth. How dare you! For more than 30 years the science has been crystal clear. How dare you continue to look away and come here saying that you are doing enough when the politics and solutions needed are still nowhere in sight. You say you hear us and that you understand the urgency. But no matter how sad and angry I am I dont want to believe that. Because if you fully understood the situation and still kept on failing to act then you would be evil. And I refuse to believe that. The popular idea of cutting our emissions in half in 10 years only gives us a 50 chance of staying below 1.5C degrees and the risk of setting off irreversible chain reactions beyond human control. Maybe 50 is acceptable to you. But those numbers dont include tipping points most feedback loops additional warming hidden by toxic air pollution or the aspects of justice and equity. They also rely on my and my childrens generation sucking hundreds of billions of tonnes of your CO2 out of the air with technologies that barely exist. So a 50 risk is simply not acceptable to us we who have to live with the consequences. To have a 67 chance of staying below a 1.5C global temperature rise the best odds given by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change the world had 420 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide left to emit back on 1 January 2018. Today that figure is already down to less than 350 gigatonnes. How dare you pretend that this can be solved with business as usual and some technical solutions. With todays emissions levels that remaining CO2 budget will be entirely gone in less than eight and a half years. There will not be any solutions or plans presented in line with these figures today. Because these numbers are too uncomfortable. And you are still not mature enough to tell it like it is. You are failing us. But the young people are starting to understand your betrayal. The eyes of all future generations are upon you. And if you choose to fail us I say we will never forgive you. We will not let you get away with this. Right here right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming whether you like it or not.	True	False	False	True	False
California and 16 other states sued the Trump administration Tuesday over its plan to scrap Obama era auto emissions standards that would require vehicles to get significantly higher gas mileage by 2025. At issue is a move by Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt to roll back 2012 rules aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Under those rules vehicles would have to get 36 miles of real world driving per gallon about 10 miles over the existing standard. Pollutants coming out of vehicles out of the tailpipe does permanent lung damage to children living near well traveled roads and freeways. This is a fact. The only way we're going to overcome that is by reducing emissions Gov. Jerry Brown said in announcing the lawsuit along with other top California Democrats. The rules were set six years ago when California and the Obama administration agreed to a single nationwide fuel economy standard. Pruitt who has sought to block or delay an array of environmental regulations has argued that assumptions about gas prices and vehicle technology used by the Obama administration to set the standards were too optimistic. And he said the standards would hurt automakers and consumers who can't afford or don't want to buy more fuel efficient vehicles. Automakers have likewise argued that the Obama era rules would cost the industry billions of dollars and raise vehicle prices because of the cost of developing the necessary technology. EPA representatives did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the lawsuit. California officials say the standards are achievable and the EPA's effort to repeal them is not based on any new research. They argue the plan violates the federal Clean Air Act and didn't follow the agency's own regulations. California has a unique waiver that allows it to set its own tailpipe emissions standards for vehicles which it has used to combat smog and more recently global warming. Thirteen other states and the District of Columbia have adopted the California standards as their own. California has now sued the Trump administration more than 30 times on topics including immigration and health care policy. The world is not flat pollution is not free and the health and safety of our children is not for sale said Democratic state Attorney General Xavier Becerra standing alongside the governor. Brown who has made fighting climate change a core of his policy and political platform said the state's battles with Washington over climate are the most essential. If we follow the Pruitt Trump path we follow our way off the cliff to disaster he said. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Joining California were Connecticut Delaware Illinois Iowa Maine Maryland Minnesota New Jersey New York Oregon Rhode Island Vermont Washington Massachusetts Pennsylvania Virginia and the District of Columbia. All have Democratic attorneys general.	True	True	True	True	False
The twin disasters of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma showcased once again the media's reflex to use such tragedies to push for liberal climate change policies. In their pursuit of this agenda the broadcast networks' have heavily criticized the Trump administration's policies on the environment. From January 20 through August 31 MRC analysts tallied 75 stories discussing the President and climate change totaling 73 minutes 43 seconds of network airtime. The commentary in these stories was as one sided as the rest of Trump's coverage has been with 88 percent of evaluative statements criticizing the President vs. a mere 12 percent that praised him. Methodology Our measure of spin was designed to isolate the networks own slant not the back and forth of partisan politics. Thus our analysts ignored soundbites which merely showcased the traditional party line Republicans supporting Trump Democrats criticizing him and instead tallied evaluative statements which imparted a clear positive or negative tone to the story such as statements from experts presented as non partisan voters or opinionated statements from the networks own reporters. Using these criteria MRC analysts tallied 121 evaluative statements about the Trump administrations approach to the environment from January 20 to August 31 2017 of which 106 88 were negative vs. a mere 15 12 which were positive. This study does not look at all climate change related stories during this time frame. Instead it covers specifically the coverage of President Trumps environmental agenda on ABC World News Tonight CBS Evening News and NBC Nightly News. The most consistent factor in all of this coverage was the criticism. NBC Nightly News correspondent Matt Bradleys July 30 quip that President Donald Trump shifts American climate commitments into reverse was typical of the media attitude towards the presidents environmental policies. On June 2 Nightly News correspondent Kristen Welker promoted an anti Trump protest over this decision hyping the backlash is only heating up. The same night CBS Evening Newss anchor Anthony Mason spoke of the world of opposition to withdraw from the Paris climate accord. Correspondent Chip Reid echoed by referencing worldwide condemnation. NBC Nightly News anchor Savannah Guthrie on June 1 criticized the move to withdraw from the climate treaty detractors say it is a stunning abandonment of the U.S.s leadership in the world and a grave threat to the planet itself. To their credit CBS stood alone in interviewing a conservative to hear the other side of the climate change debate. On April 22 CBS Evening News correspondent Dean Reynolds noted that Joe Bast CEO of The Heartland Institute looks with approval on Mr. Trumps decision to roll back regulations limiting greenhouse gases and to his appointments of fellow skeptics in the administration. Climate change he Bast says is a naturally occurring cyclical phenomenon caused mostly by the sun not an approaching disaster accelerated by carbon dioxide emissions caused by humans. However before stating this position Reynolds noted that most climate scientists the United Nations as well as NASA dismiss these arguments as propaganda for fossil fuels. On March 28 NBC Nightly News profiled celebrations in coal country over Trumps environmental proposals mentioning a barber shop in West Virginia where they cheered the move hoping it will bring back jobs. Afterwards correspondent Kristen Welker noted that federal data shows mines have been losing jobs for decades under both parties. Right now there are less than seventy five thousand coal jobs compared to more than six hundred and fifty thousand in renewable energy which can be less expensive to produce.

Statements from activists and politicians linking natural disasters to man made global warming are almost always false according to a book debunking misinformation about climate science. The newest version of the book The Rightful Place of Science Disasters Climate Change by University of Colorado professor Roger Pielke Jr. takes on the often false claims peddled in the media about global warming and disasters from hurricanes to floods to droughts. Every time there is a disaster politicians journalists and scientists unfailingly spring to life to tell us that the disaster and the costs and suffering that accompanied it were associated with linked to or even caused by climate change Pielke wrote in his newly updated book. Such statements as Ill show in this book are almost always false he wrote. While no skeptic of man made warming Pielke painstakingly goes through peer reviewed scientific assessments separating the science from the media spin when it comes to natural disasters.RELATED Dan Rather Claims That Global Warming Rarely Tops The Headlines. Is That True? Pielkes motivation in releasing an updated version of his book initially published in 2014 was he saw the issue of extreme weather become politicized. Now journalists and politicians are tying every weather event to man made warming despite the lack of scientific evidence. For example The New Republics Emily Atkinrecently calledfor journalists to put every weather event in the context of global warming. Her call even got a reaction from NPR which defended its reporting but was sympathetic to her message. Popular figures like Bill Nye the Science Guy and former Vice President Al Gore routinely link natural disasters to global warming. California Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown blamed the intense wildfires in his state on a new normal from a warming climate. But the most thorough scientific assessments show no increasing trends in global frequency or intensity for many types of disasters including hurricanes floods droughts and wildfires. While political spin doctors often find ways to parse language and statistics to say things that are plausibly defensible but which are ultimately misleading or just wrong for me such misrepresentations have gone too far in an area where I have some considerable expertise Pielke wrote. The willingness of some in the media and the scientific community to offer false or misleading claims does not offer a route to scientific integrity Pielke wrote. Pielke gives many examples of this including The New York Times hyping of the National Climate Assessment NCA special report released in 2017. The Times claimed the NCA showed how every part of the country has been touched by warming from droughts in the Southeast to flooding in the Midwest to a worrying rise in air and ground temperatures in Alaska and conditions will continue to worsen. The article went on to quote Penn State Universitys Michael Mann to bolster its claim. But Pielke was quick to point how the NCAdid not supportThe Times sweeping claims about warming. Anyone claiming that new US climate report supports attributing trends in extremes to human causes is just wrong Pielke said at the time. However Pielke has paid a price for pointing out inconvenient truths about extreme weather and global warming. Pielkes career beentargetedby Democratic lawmakers and activist journalists to impress a billionaire donor. This stance has ultimately led me to being systematically attacked any time I make a public statement about climate change in effect railroading me out of the climate debate as an unwelcome voice Pielke wrote. While this is often extremely frustrating I remain committed to doing the best job I can analyzing data on climate and disasters in ways that are transparent and grounded in evidence.

Climate scientist Cliff Mass is speaking out against academic political bullying from University of Washington faculty and students stemming from Masss rejection of a carbon tax initiative favored by activists. Science can only flourish when there is tolerance for a diversity of viewpoints and ideas Mass told The Daily Caller News Foundation. Name calling and politicization of science are toxic to the scientific enterprise and undermines our credibility in the general community. I am hopeful that the exposure of such intolerance will lead to an improved working environment in my department and among others in my discipline Mass said via email Wednesday. Climate scientist Judith Curry detailed in a blog postWednesday the actions UW and student activists have taken against Mass in recent months. Curry said Mass was a victim of academic political bullying. There are clearly UW faculty that dont like Cliff Mass including his department chair and most fundamentally they seem to dislike that his blog is getting in the way of their own political advocacy Curry wrote. Mass joined UWs Atmospheric Sciences Department in 1982 where he specializes in numerical weather modeling and weather patterns in the Pacific Northwest. Mass also publishes a science blog and has a popular weekly radio show. RELATED TheDCNF Asked Paris Climate Accord Backers If Theyd Support Banning Private Jets. Most Didnt Respond Mass is no global warming denier as many critics try to label him. Mass has repeatedly called global warming a serious threat and supported policies including carbon taxes to cut carbon dioxide emissions. Despite his agreement with the climate consensus Mass has increasingly come under fire from activists for not toeing the alarmist line when it comes to blaming extreme weather events on global warming. What seems to have driven Masss critics over the edge this time was the atmospheric scientists public opposition to a Washington state carbon tax ballot initiative called I 1631. In particular critics went after a blog post Mass wrote in mid October detailing why he opposed I 1631. Voters overwhelmingly rejected the carbon tax measure in November despite support from Gov. Jay Inslee and other Democrats. I 1631 will be a trough of billions of dollars of cash for left leaning social action and progressive groups and dealing with climate change will be a secondary priority Mass wrote in a blog post with a picture of pigs feeding at a trough. The picture has since been removed. The imagery of pigs feeding at a trough has long been used to describe special interest groups trying to syphon off government spending. State spending seen as wasteful or geared toward a special interest is often called pork or pork barrel spending. However UW students and climate activists claimed it was racist. I 1631 campaigner Izzy Goodman tweetedin October that this alone proves that he is a blatant racist which is probably why his climate policies are too!. She later added UW you going to stand for this? When Mass tried to reason with her UW philosophy Ph.D. candidate Alex Lenferna tweeted Calling you racist for saying racist things is not name calling its an accurate description. The post showed Masss small government racist anti working class view tweeted Lenferna who also campaigned for I 1631. Student activists didnt stop at Twitter insults. Curry who spoke at length with Mass about the events wrote The attacks ramped up when a group of students complained to the Assistant Dean for Diversity Equity and Inclusion. Curry said the students accused Mass of deception being on the payroll of oil companies purposely obfuscating with multiple twitter accounts racism misogyny tokenism Trumpism. Rather than meet with Cliff Mass to discuss the Assistant Dean sent a mass email to the faculty of the Atmospheric Sciences Department echoing student complaints Curry wrote. The assistant deans email claimed the blog had imagery and text that was racially insensitive and caused offense to a significant number of members in the departmental community. The assistant dean made no attempt to contact Mass or try to understand that there was no racism evident or intended and that the image in question was quickly removed from the blog post Curry wrote. The matter didnt end there however and Atmospheric Sciences Department Chair Dale Durran sent a mass email to the Department faculty including the link to Lenfernas post and voicing concern about Mass behavior and racism' Curry noted. Durran held a faculty wide meeting on Dec. 4. Durran reportedly took control of the meeting and even prevented Mass from finishing his opening remarks. RELATED Washington Governor Warns There Is Not Survival From Climate Change. That Is Unless His Policies Are Adopted Durran hectored Mass throughout the meeting Curry wrote. The activist students were true to form hurling all kinds of insulting personal and inappropriate remarks as Mass sat through the inquisition. Duran was an ardent supporter of I 1631. Durran got 21 of his colleagues to sign a public letter published in The Seattle Times in late October endorsing the carbon tax ballot measure. Now is the time to take a big step to kick our carbon habit Durran and his colleagues wrote. However Curry reported that several faculty members felt uncomfortable signing this including one who told her they actually voted against the measure. Durran did not respond to TheDCNFs request for comment.

Former Vice President Al Gore said Monday that the U.S. is going through a challenging time under the Trump administration decrying President Trumps decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. Weve never had a president whos deliberately made decisions the effect of which is to tear down Americas standing in the world starting with his withdrawal from the Paris Agreement Gore said Monday on NBCs Today Show. The climate crisis is by far the most serious challenge we face. Trump announced last month that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement an international pact signed by more than 190 countries to commit to fighting climate change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Gore who has spent much of his time after his 2000 presidential run crusading to fight climate change met with Trump last year at Trump Tower to discuss climate change. The meetings had given Gore hope that the president would come to his senses about the Paris Agreement. But I was wrong Gore said. He declined to elaborate on what was discussed in the meeting. Trump who has called climate change a hoax argued in June that withdrawing from the Paris Agreement would benefit the U.S. economy. Well the business community does not believe that at all Gore said on CBS Sunday Morning. There are now twice as many jobs in the solar industry as in the coal industry. In the U.S. the number of solar jobs is growing 17 times faster than the number of jobs in other industries Gore said calling the solar industry one of the brightest spots in our economic revival. But the former vice president who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his climate change work has faced pushback from some conservatives for his efforts. Fox Friends criticized Gore for comparing the climate change fight to fights against moral issues such as slavery and apartheid in a July 13 speech at the Ecocity World summit in Australia. The climate movement not least in cities is right now in the tradition of all the great moral causes that have improved the circumstances of humanity throughout our history Gore said in the speech. The abolition of slavery. Womens suffrage and womens rights. The civil rights movement and the anti apartheid movement in South Africa. Seriously?? Former VP Al Gore compares climate battle to fight against slavery and apartheid Fox Friends tweeted. The longtime climate change battle advocate has taken criticism of his work in stride. If everybodys just completely happy with what youre doing you may not be working hard enough to bring about the kind of change that we need Gore said on CBS. He added that hell continue to fight climate change adding I could not lay this fight down or put it aside even if I wanted to. I dont want to. On NBC Gore was quick to say that Trumps decision to leave the Paris Agreement is just one of the ways in which the president has hurt Americas standing in the world citing damage to international alliances such as NATO. The months ahead will be a test for the American people Gore said on NBC.	True	False	False	True	True
The Seychelles has created protected areas the size of Great Britain in the Indian Ocean. In exchange for getting some of its national debt paid off the island nation has agreed to protect 210000 sq km 81000 sq miles of ocean. The reserves will limit tourism and fishing activities in the Seychelles to halt further damage to aquatic life. A foundation set up by actor Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the investors that worked on the deal. The Oscar winner said This effort will help the people of Seychelles protect their ocean for future generations and will serve as a model for future marine conservation projects worldwide. Seychelles President Danny Faure said Our large ocean brings development opportunities but also responsibility. By planning properly to protect our environment we can be sure we are also protecting our people and their livelihoods against an uncertain future. This is understood to be the first debt swap designed to protect ocean areas in the world. The Seychelles government agreed the debt swap with the Nature Conservancy a US charity and a number of investors back in 2016. Under the terms of the 21m 15m deal the charity and the investors including the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation paid for a portion of the Seychelles national debt. The country will then direct future national debt payments into a new trust the Seychelles Conservation and Climate Adaptation Trust SeyCCAT. This trust will offer lower interest rates on debt repayments and any savings will go to fund new projects designed to protect marine life and handle the effects of climate change. The Seychelles is raising the percentage of its protected waters from 0.04 to 30 by 2020 as part of the agreement. This first part of the plan creates two new marine parks. The first covers the Aldabra islands home to hundreds of thousands of tortoises nesting bird colonies and the dugong one of the more endangered species in the Indian Ocean. This area will be fully protected with only research and regulated tourism allowed. The second area concerns the seas around the Seychelles' main islands and will limit the fishing and tourism activities there. This is a critical accomplishment in our mission to bring conservation to scale across the globe said Nature Conservancy CEO Mark Tercek. What you see today in Seychelles is what we expect to introduce in the Caribbean and other ocean regions facing the threats of climate change.	True	True	False	True	True
A federal judge smacked down a new effort by the Trump administration to roll back an Obama era rule aimed at restricting harmful methane emissions from oil and gas production on federal lands according to a new report on Wednesday. The news comes as Donald Trumps Interior Department was in the process of delaying the regulation until 2019 calling it too burdensome to the industry. More from the report via The Washington Post The order by a judge in San Francisco came as the Interior Department moved to delay the rule until 2019 saying it was too burdensome to industry. The action followed an earlier effort by Interior to postpone part of the rule set to take effect next year. U.S. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Laporte of the Northern District of California said Interior had failed to give a reasoned explanation for the changes and had not offered details why an earlier analysis by the Obama administration was faulty. She ordered the entire rule reinstated immediately. As the U.S. Magistrate Judge Laporte noted in her ruling the reason she called for the Obama era rule to be reinstated right away is that the Trump administration cannot give a reasoned explanation as to why its flawed. In a way that cuts to the heart of everything this administration has done so far when it comes to environmental policy. After all there is no reasonable explanation for anything this president has done when it comes to the environment whether its allowing toxic sludge to be dumped in our waterways or pulling out of the historic Paris climate accord. While the previous administration let science and data drive its climate agenda the Trump administration has had one goal in mind destroying former President Obamas environmental legacy. On Wednesday one federal judge reminded Donald Trump that hating Barack Obama is not a good enough reason to ignore key environmental protections.	True	False	False	True	True
Strong winds on Sunday were expected to hamper progress for crews battling California wildfires which have now claimed at least 79 lives. Gusts of up to 50mph were threatening efforts to control the Camp blaze which is still only 55 contained 10 days after it brought devastation to northern California. The fire which destroyed nearly 10000 homes and has spread across 233sq miles is already the deadliest American wildfire in a century. And there are fears that the eventual death toll will rise much higher with almost 1300 people still unaccounted for. However it seems likely that number of missing persons may be an over estimate amid confusion over the way the list has been compiled. Butte county sheriff Kory Honea has stressed that the roster has been built up from missing person reports from calls reports and emails since the fire began on 8 November. He has described it as raw data and said there is the likely possibility that the list contains duplicate names and some evacuees who have not reported themselves safe. Californias outgoing Democratic governor Jerry Brown visited the scene of devastation at the town of Paradise with Donald Trump on Saturday. He told CBSs Face the Nation that Trump has got our back and has committed emergency support. Trump initially blamed state officials for poor forest management in making the fires in northern and southern California worse and even threatened to cut off federal funding. At the scene on Saturday Trump recounted a conversation he had in Paris on 11 November with Finlands president Sauli Niinisto who talked about monitoring forest resources with a good surveillance system. Trump said wildfires werent a problem in Finland because the Finns spend a lot of time on raking leaves and cleaning and doing things. But Sauli Niinist president of Finland told one of the countrys leading newspapers Ilta Sanomat on Sunday that he never discussed raking with Trump. I mentioned to him that Finland is a land covered by forests and we also have a good monitoring system and network Niinist said but had no recollection of mentioning raking of leaves or forest undergrowth which the president appears to have seized on as a key point in wildfire prevention while dismissing the issue of global warming. Asked on Saturday whether he thought climate change had a role in the fires he said you have a lot of factors. And asked if seeing the devastation changed his mind on climate change Trump said No. No. I have a strong opinion. I want great climate. Were going to have that. Jerry Brown in the interview aired on Sunday said Changing climate and the increasing drought and the lower humidity and water vapor were important factors. He said Managing the forest is part of it. Theyre a lot denser than they were 200 years ago. But on top of that we have this five year drought. We have reduced rainfall. We have the dryness that turns vegetation and bushes and houses and trees into literally into timber. So its ready to explode. So there is an atmospheric element which is part of the natural cycle and then there is an increasing effect of climate change. But asked if he had made that case to Trump he said I certainly raised it but I didnt feel that that was where we needed to go then added that science would be the guide for analysing the fires and the president in no way negated that.

ROME Pope Francis told a group of lawyers that he could like to introduce the category of ecological sin into official Catholic teaching. We must introduce we are thinking about it in the Catechism of the Catholic Church the sin against ecology the ecological sin against the common home because it is a duty the pope said Friday in addressing participants in an international conference on penal law. More specifically Francis said are all those actions that can be considered as ecocide for instance the massive contamination of air land and water resources the large scale destruction of flora and fauna and any action capable of producing an ecological disaster or destroying an ecosystem. Ecocide is to be understood as the loss damage or destruction of the ecosystems of a given territory so that its utilization by inhabitants has been or can be seen as severely compromised he said adding that such a sin is a fifth category of crimes against peace which should be recognised as such by the international community. The pontiff said that such actions are usually caused by corporations and an elementary sense of justice would require that they be punished for them. An ecological sin is an action or omission against God against ones neighbour the community and the environment Francis said quoting the Fathers of the recently concluded Pan Amazon Regional Synod. It is a sin against future generations and is manifested in acts and habits of pollution and destruction of the harmony of the environment in transgressions against the principles of interdependence and in the breaking of networks of solidarity between creatures. Above and beyond its sinfulness failure to care for the environment is an injustice and a crime Francis suggested and should be legally enforced. I would like to appeal to all the leaders and actors in this area to contribute their efforts to ensuring adequate legal protection for our common home he said. The popes words coincided with the release of a new survey by the Pew Research Center which found that church going Americans accept their clergys on spiritual matters but generally distrust their advice on issues such as climate change. Pew found that 68 percent of U.S. adults who attend religious services at least a few times a year say they have a lot of confidence in the advice of their clergy on growing closer to God yet just a small fraction of this number 13 percent say they have this confidence when the topic is climate change. Pope Francis has thrown his moral weight behind the battle against anthropogenic climate change but has also acknowledged that the Church has no authority on scientific questions. In his 2015 encyclical letter on the environment Francis urging nations and individuals to exercise more responsible stewardship of the created world but insisted that he wanted to encourage debate rather than pronounce on environmental issues. On many concrete questions he wrote the Church has no reason to offer a definitive opinion she knows that honest debate must be encouraged among experts while respecting divergent views. Here I would state once more that the Church does not presume to settle scientific questions or to replace politics Francis said. But I am concerned to encourage an honest and open debate so that particular interests or ideologies will not prejudice the common good.	True	False	False	True	True
He recently posed for a GQ magazine photo shoot with a fly fishing rod in front of snow capped Montana peaks. He rode a horse named Tonto down the National Mall to his first day of work at the Interior Department. And earlier this month he donned a National Park Service uniform to greet park goers at the entrance of the Grand Canyon. Montana born interior secretary Ryan Zinke who meets with President Trump on Friday morning meticulously crafts his image as wilderness loving western cowboy and sportsman. But nine months into his job at the Department of the Interior the federal agency that oversees most public lands and natural resources the act is wearing thin with environmentalists and outdoors enthusiasts who say his early moves demonstrate strong allegiance to the oil gas and other extractive industries seeking access to some of Americas most spectacular protected landscapes. He has reversed an Obama era ban on coal mining on public lands and proposed changes that would shrink the borders of four national monuments set aside by previous presidents. His agency has taken early steps to open the door to oil exploration in Alaskas Arctic National Wildlife Refuge one of the most symbolic and fiercely protected sites of the American environmental movement. Hes announced plans to repeal an important fracking safety rule and loosened safety guidelines for underwater drilling both major shifts away from Obama era environmental protection regulations. Earlier this week his agency set off a new firestorm of criticism by announcing that entrance fees for some of Americas most popular national parks will increase substantially next year. To make it cheaper for coal companies to strip mine in watersheds and make it more expensive for families to visit Yosemite is a perversion of American values said Michael Brune executive director of the Sierra Club. I think the secretary is a fraud. Meanwhile Zinke is also coming under scrutiny for other reasons including his use of private and military jets. According to Politico the secretary spent more than 12000 on a private jet to his home state of Montana and took a private plane to the US Virgin Islands. Zinke who declined to be interviewed for this story called the travel controversy a little BS in a public appearance. Most recently lawmakers from both parties in the mainland US and Puerto Rico have called for an investigation into how a tiny energy company in Zinkes hometown of Whitefish Montana won a major contract to rebuild power lines in hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico. The interior department has denied that Zinke played a role in the contract award. The interior department is in charge of the management and conservation of most federal lands and natural resources and it includes important divisions such as the National Park Service the Bureau of Land Management and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. As such the agency is often the arbiter between oil gas and mining companies seeking access to valuable resources embedded in public lands and environmentalists seeking to protect the same lands for biodiversity wildlife and recreation. Zinke has reshaped the department filling top political posts with former executives and lobbyist for the extractive industries. Deputy interior secretary David Bernhardt for example is a former lobbyist for the oil and gas industry. According to a report by the Western Values Project a progressive organization at least 21 of Zinkes political appointees have backgrounds tied to extractive industries. He sold himself as a Theodore Roosevelt Republican. That means wise use said Land Tawney president of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers a national conservation group headquartered in Montana. More and more sportsmen are waking up to whats going on. Since he took over the department Zinke has also resurrected an arcane military ritual requiring staff to hoist the department flag above the building whenever he enters. Zinke the son of a plumber and a realtor grew up in Whitefish a ski town of 4000 people in northwestern Montana. The6ft 4in secretary is a former high school and college football hero and a retired Navy Seal. Zinke made his name politically as a moderate Republican in Montanas legislature and easily won his first run for Congress in 2014 by a margin of 15 points. He repeated that success two years later despite questions about whether he actually lived in Montana and earlier suggestions that he failed to rise in the ranks of the Navy because of travel spending improprieties. Given his moderate politics in his home state many are scratching their heads over his hardline turn. Observers says hes not ideologically driven like Scott Pruitt the Environmental Protection Agency administrator who has set clear focused sights on dismantling environmental regulations in the United States for the benefit of industry. At his confirmation hearing Zinke said he was concerned about climate change and he regularly declares his love for public lands. Gloria Flora a former US Forest Service manager in Montana and prominent conservationist believes Zinke is fairly easy to explain in the context of political tribalism of the Trump era. Hes a Montanan. Hes on the Trump team. Hes doing Trump politics in every place but Montana she said. When its not personal then you revert to what your team has been saying and the values your team has. It is apparent Zinke wants to cultivate a folksy persona for the public but he doesnt want difficult interactions with that public. Earlier this month when he put on a park workers uniform to greet park goers at the entrance of the Grand Canyon a visitor questioned him on his proposal for national monuments. Zinke shut the man down with a smile and no answers. Whether the Trump administration succeeds in changing the shape of Americas public lands could depend on Zinke. For now his early moves and those potential changes appear to have galvanized a thriving opposition uncharmed by his cowboy style.	False	True	True	True	True
After Florida was hit by the devastating Hurricane Michael this week Sen. Marco Rubio R FL made it clear he would rather lie about climate change whichmakes these storms worse than commit to doing anything to stop it. On Sunday mornings edition of CNNs State of the Union host Jake Tapper pressed Rubio about the recent United Nations report on climate change which predicts global catastrophe if carbon emissions are not cut dramatically in the next 12 years. Do you believe climate change is at least in part man made? Tapper asked. Rubio said that while scientists agree that human behavior is contributing to climate change Icant tell you what percentage of that is due to human activity. He also claimed that many scientists would debate the percentage of what is attributable to man versus normal fluctuations. No matter what we do with laws lets say we went to all solar panels and did all that stuff which is not realistic this trend of sea level rise would still continue Rubio said. Instead of clean energy or reducing emissions Rubio said he is focused on strategies to mitigate those factors that are going be in place no matter what happens with our energy policy. But he added Im also not going to destroy our economy. Almost every word out of Rubios mouth was either a lie or a shameful dodge. There is overwhelming scientific consensusincluding from the United States government that human activity is the main driver of climate change. There is no debate among scientists about this. Human society is overwhelmingly responsible for our warming planet. Thats why it makes no sense to quibble as Rubio does about exactly what percentage of climate change is caused by humans. No matter what the answer is most or all of it. And contrary to Rubios assertions theUnited NationsIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC report says that drastic reductions in carbon emissions could in fact prevent the most catastrophic effects of climate change. The report says that in order to avoid irreversible global warming Global net human caused emissions of carbon dioxide CO2 would need to fall by about 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030 reaching net zero around 2050. Reducing our carbon emissions will also reduce the effects of climate change. Its as simple as that. But Rubio apparently wants to throw up his hands and claim that since rising seas will drown Florida no matter what all we can really do is strengthen levies or lift up roads and buildings. Rubio also seems to think that reducing carbon emissions would do more to destroy our economy than say allowing 1 million Florida homes to flood by the end of this century. Unfortunately Republicans like Rubio have joined Trump in ignoring science and doing everything they can to keep pumping as much carbon into the atmosphere as they can get away with. Americans deserve leaders who will do everything they can to prevent the catastrophic effects of climate change instead of waffling and lying about it like Rubio.

Editors note Radley Horton is a professor at Columbia Universitys Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory where he studies climate extremes impacts and adaptation. He spoke with NewsHour economics correspondent Paul Solman for Thursdays Making Sene segment on flood insurance. The following excerpt of their interview has been edited for length and clarity. Paul Solman How certain are we or can we be that these storms and the flooding associated with them is a function of climate change? Radley Horton There are many components to these storms. And depending on what part were talking about the certainty differs. There are some aspects that are really a sure thing. For example we know that sea levels are rising. We know thats going to continue. And even if storms dont change at all just by virtue of raising that baseline raising that floor were going to see more frequent and more severe coastal flooding. But when we look at some of the really fundamental aspects of a storm itself theres more uncertainty. The balance of evidence suggests that the strongest storms will become stronger with stronger winds more storm surge as the planet warms and as the upper oceans warm. But we cant say its a sure thing. PS What about the larger cycles of the planet? Dont they override or mightnt they override the kinds of things we as human beings are doing in the short term? RH There are many things that can impact the climate for sure. But right now during this era that were living in human activities and the burning of fossil fuels is by far the most powerful influence. Just since the start of the industrial revolution weve increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by about 40 percent. Its already caused sea levels to rise close to a foot in many places along the U.S. coast. So thats increasing the risk of these types of storms. WATCH Less than half of Florida homeowners have flood insurance PS Cant we mitigate the effects of flooding? I mean thats what theyre doing raising houses all over the coastline in the United States and countries like Holland. RH The types of mitigation efforts youre talking about are critical. This is what we often hear referred to as resilience or adapting to a changing climate. And that has to be a key component of all strategies. We absolutely do need to strengthen that infrastructure whether its elevating buildings green infrastructure that can capture some of these excess water. We need those strategies. But you start to wonder at what point have things changed too much for us to be able to adapt to? For example if you look at parts of South Florida as sea levels rise as the water table rises no matter how much money you put into trying to build sea walls that water is just going to make its way up like Swiss cheese through some of that limestone. You cant hold the water back. PS So what would you advise somebody who lives in a floodplain? Should they just get out? Because many cant economically right? Or do they jack up their houses? Is that the best approach? RH If you live in a flood zone certainly you should be thinking about climate change. Thats one of the dimensions. But there are a lot of other factors that impact vulnerability as well. When people were assessing the risk originally and defining the flood zones they made estimates based on 10 20 years of rainfall data. Thats an insufficiently long sample to really estimate the true one in a hundred year risk. Another concern is that since that home was built there may have been changes in development in surrounding areas. If you look at what happened in Houston recently so much of the natural area had been covered up with pavement. That changes the flood risk. But when it comes to the climate change piece and if were talking about homes that are in coastal zones sea level rise is a game changer. PS When the federal government redraws a map in a place like Pequannock New Jersey and includes more and more houses hundreds more houses in the floodplain is the government potentially overreacting? RH The government is trying to update using the latest available information. More years of weather data are now available and thereve been changes in the land use in some of these regions as well that impact the path that that water takes. PS Has flood insurance basically induced people to take risks that they shouldnt be taking? RH Quite possibly. Thats why we need a much deeper discussion both about those properties that currently are insured and about uninsured properties and about properties that as the climate changes are going to be moving into newly defined flood zones. In the future we could see property values fall not because water touches or doesnt touch some of these homes but because of systemic risk the inability of insurance to cover all these assets or investors finally realizing that a lot of critical infrastructure isnt going to be fundable.

Here's the issue Pruitt told CNN in a phone interview. To have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm versus helping people or actually facing the effect of the storm is misplaced. He continued What we need to focus on is access to clean water addressing these areas of superfund activities that may cause an attack on water these issues of access to fuel. ... Those are things so important to citizens of Florida right now and to discuss the cause and effect of these storms there's the... place and time to do that it's not now. President Donald Trump has previously called climate change a hoax and Pruitt has led a push to roll back EPA regulations regarding greenhouse gas emissions. Hurricane Irma is hammering a string of northeast Caribbean islands and making its way toward a possible hit on Florida over the weekend. As the Category 5 storm heads toward the Florida coast experts have been clear about how global warming has contributed to the increased strength of hurricanes this season. Gradually warming temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico as much as 2 degrees Celsius above average could be a pressure cooker for key ingredients of a hurricane extreme winds rainfall and storm surge. Pruitt said that it's up to Congress to eventually address the issue but right now the EPA's focus is on providing assistance to those in need in Florida. Congress should address that at some point. And Congress hasn't he said. All I'm saying to you is to use time and effort to address it at this point is very very insensitive to this people in Florida. Pruitt said that the EPA is putting extra attention into monitoring 80 toxic waste sites otherwise known as superfund sites in the case that they affect the water in Florida. As waters recede in Houston attention turns to chemical facilities There's a multitude of these kinds of sites he said. We are working in advance with the owners of those sites to secure those sites ... to prevent leakage andor harm to citizens in the area. Pruitt also said that to speed up the delivery of fuel and other critical supplies he rescinded all weight and driver restrictions on its highways. Florida has also tried to improve gasoline supplies by getting an EPA waiver for certain regulations that would normally restrict the kind of fuels it can use. He added he's embedded staff in towns and cities in Florida so that they can make real time decisions for the hurricane. My focus has to be on ... these areas that I described he said. And with all respect really that's where I have to focus on. After Harvey 'we have to protect ourselves' After Harvey 'we have to protect ourselves'	True	True	True	True	False
A total of 10 US national monuments are in the Trump administrations sights to be either resized or repurposed in order to allow activities such as mining logging and grazing within their borders. Environmental groups have vowed legal action to stymie any alterations to the protected areas. Here are the 10 national monuments identified for change by Ryan Zinke the secretary of the interior. Designated in December 2016 by Barack Obama Bears Ears national monument is a 1.35m acre expanse of mesas buttes and Native American archaeological sites that sprawls across south eastern Utah. Its many splendors include a series of stunning rock bridges as well as the aptly named Grand Gulch an intricate canyon system thick with thousand year old ruins. A whopping 1.9m acres south central Utahs Grand Staircase Escalante was set aside by Bill Clinton in 1996 and is the largest terrestrial national monument in the US. It contains a series of gigantic plateaus and cliffs the Grand Staircase as well as a string of deep gorges known as the Escalante River Canyons. The first national monument established solely to protect its rich biodiversity Clinton deemed the Cascade Siskiyou an ecological wonderland when he protected it at about 52000 acres in 2000. In his final week in office Obama responded to calls from local conservationists and scientists and expanded the monument adding approximately 48000 acres. Covering nearly 300000 acres of remote desert north east of Las Vegas the Gold Butte monument was created by Obama in December 2016. Its chiseled red sandstone towers canyons and mountains contain a treasure trove of rock art and are an important habitat for species such as the Mojave desert tortoise bighorn sheep and the mountain lion. Roxanne Quimby co founder of Burts Bees cosmetics and her foundation purchased tracts of land in the northern reaches of Maine with the purpose of creating a national park. When this plan was opposed by various state and federal politicians Obama stepped in to create a 87000 acre national monument dominated by mountains and lush forests. Another Obama creation the marine monument was designated in September 2016 and sits off the New England coast. The area was protected to safeguard an ecosystem of deep sea corals three species of whale and an endangered species of sea turtle the Kemps ridley. A huge monument spanning nearly 500000 acres and proclaimed in May 2014. There are several hundred known archaeological sites in this mountainous stretch of New Mexico including some of the earliest known native American settlements. In the 1960s US astronauts used the area to train for lunar missions. Declared by President George W Bush in 2009 and expanded by Obama in 2014 the monument covers 480000 square miles in marine areas to the south and west of Hawaii. The scattered reserve contains rare birds trees and grasses as well as largely untouched coral reefs. Found at an average elevation of 7000ft this New Mexico monument was created in 2013. The area is riddled with volcanic cones with the Rio Grande flowing through an 800ft gorge in the layers of volcanic basalt flows and ash. The monument has several archaeological sites and is considered a key wildlife corridor for migrating animals. The enormous 8.5m acre monument in the south Pacific was declared by Bush in January 2009. Rare petrels shearwaters and terns are found there as well as giant clams reef sharks and rose coloured corals. It is considered by the Fish Wildlife Service as the most important seabird habitat in the region.	True	True	False	True	True
U.S. President Donald Trump displays an Executive Order on Offshore Energy Strategy at the White House in Washington U.S. April 28 2017. Photo Kevin LamarqueReuters On the eve of his 100th day in the White House President Trump signed an executive order Friday intended to let energy companies drill for oil in currently protected areas of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. The move was swiftly condemned by environmentalists but Trump hailed it as a victory for the economy. This is a great day for American workers and families. And today were unleashing American energy and clearing the way for thousands and thousands of high paying American energy jobs Trump said before signing the order. So far Trumps energy policies have aimed at reversing the plentiful environmental protections established by his predecessor former President Barack Obama. In the Roosevelt Room of the White House Trump said the United States is blessed with wonderful natural resources including offshore oil and natural gas reserves which can be harnessed to stimulate energy production and job growth. He said the federal government has closed off 94 percent of these offshore areas preventing potential energy production. And when they say closed they mean closed. This deprives our country of potentially thousands and thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in wealth. I pledged to take action and today I am keeping that promise he said. Trumps signing of the America First Offshore Energy Strategy comes a day before the Peoples Climate March an international protest against Trumps energy and environmental policies. The flagship march in Washington D.C. and the more than 300 affiliated marchers across the globe are expected to draw thousands. Though similar to last weeks March for Science the march on Saturday will focus on Trumps efforts to remove regulations intended to protect the environment and curb climate change rather than scientific integrity. According to Trump the new executive order begins the process of opening many offshore areas to job creating energy exploration and rescinds the Obama administrations permanent protection of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. A month before leaving office Obama banned offshore drilling in nearly all of the Arctic under U.S. control to protect marine life and prevent potential oil spills. He also declared portions of the Atlantic Ocean unsuitable for drilling. Obama relied upon a little known 1953 law that allows the president to ban oil and gas drilling indefinitely in U.S. waters. At the time an Obama administration official suggested that Trump would not be able to reverse the ban without an act from Congress because of its strong legal basis. On Thursday night Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke briefed the press on the contents of the executive order. He said it would direct the Interior and Commerce Departments to review offshore drilling and gas regulations in protected areas. As expected the response to Trumps executive order from the environmental community was swift and harsh. Michael Brune executive director of the Sierra Club released a statement saying that millions of Americans concerned about the dangers of offshore drilling will not be drowned out regardless of the oil lobbys influence over Trump. Just as he has throughout his 99 days in office Donald Trump will fail in this attempt to destroy our beaches and coastal communities. The people have been heard and will continue to be heard Brune said. Greenpeace USAs senior climate and energy campaigner Diana Best also released a statement condemning Trumps executive order. She said that renewable energy has already set the U.S. on course for energy independence and that offshore oil and gas drilling will condemn the nation to decades more of pollution. This executive order from the Trump administration is just the latest in a series of attempted rollbacks that most people in this country do not want and only come at the behest of Trumps inner circle of desperate fossil fuel executives Best said. Holing up at Mar a lago may protect Trump from an oil spill but it will not protect him and his cabinet of onepercenters from the millions of people in this country from California to North Carolina who will resist his disastrous policies.

Reuters U.S. presidential candidate Beto ORourke on Monday laid out one of the most detailed climate policies so far in the crowded Democratic field calling for a 5 trillion investment in clean energy technology and infrastructure over 10 years with a goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2050. ORourke the former Texas congressman made climate change the focus of his first major policy announcement unveiling the plan ahead of a campaign stop meeting with scientists at the iconic Yosemite National Park in California. The greatest threat we face which will test our country our democracy every single one of us is climate change ORourke said in a statement. The plan lays out a series of executive actions that would reverse the energy dominance policies of President Donald Trump who has been rolling back environmental regulation to increase domestic fossil fuels production. ORourkes measures include U.S. re entry into the Paris Climate Agreement ordering a reduction in methane emissions from oil and gas operations halting new drilling leases on federal land and restoring pollution standards for power plants. His plan also calls for raising taxes on the wealthy and on corporations to help fund some 5 trillion in projects to modernize infrastructure and clean energy technology over a decade. The net zero goal in ORourkes and other climate plans means reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions 100 percent or offsetting them by as much as is emitted. The bill will be funded with the revenues generated by structural changes to the tax code that ensure corporations and the wealthiest among us pay their fair share and that we finally end the tens of billions of dollars of tax breaks currently given to fossil fuel companies ORourkes legislative proposal states. The plan appears to align with some of the principles of the Green New Deal a bold set of policy goals introduced by congressional Democrats that would transform the U.S. energy economy to 100 percent renewable sources by 2030 using federal funds to invest in modern infrastructure and green job programs. Most of the Democratic presidential candidates including Bernie Sanders Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren have embraced the Green New Deal which has become a focus of attacks by the Republican party which calls it unfeasible. Other candidates have announced some specific policy measures related to climate change and the environment in recent weeks and Warren has unveiled a public lands policy that would ban new drilling and mining leases on federal lands. Environmental group the League of Conservation Voters on Monday praised ORourkes plan saying that it offered the kind of leadership we need from the next president. Still the upstart Sunrise Movement the youth led group that has pushed the Green New Deal into the spotlight said ORourkes plan fell short of what they said scientists said was necessary to fend off the worst impacts of climate change. The Green New Deal calls for achieving net zero emissions within a decade not by mid century as ORourkes plan sets out. Beto claims to support the Green New Deal but his plan is out of line with the timeline it lays out and the scale of action that scientists say is necessary to take here in the United States to give our generation a livable future said Sunrise founder Varshini Prakash.

Virginias efforts to fight climate change got a big boost after Tuesdays election with Democrats flipping both chambers of the states General Assembly. As part of its pre election platform Virginias Democratic party unanimously endorsed two major progressive environmental resolutions They voted in favor of setting a target of net zero carbon emissions for the state by 2050 and they endorsed the Green New Deal Virginia. Like the Green New Deal resolution introduced in the US Congress Virginias version aims to move the state to 100 percent renewable energy while pursuing social welfare programs like job retraining for workers who would lose their jobs in the transition. Climate change isnt a far off issue for Virginians so its not surprising that some were thinking about it at the ballot box. Many are already starting to feel the effects of the melting ice and warming oceans that result from rising average temperatures. The Hampton Roads region for example is facing the highest rate of sea level rise on the East Coast. Rising waters are worsening the impacts of tropical storms that strike the state and will cost Virginia cities billions of dollars in losses in the coming decades. Thats why Tuesdays results are a big deal for Virginia voters who want the state to do more to limit climate change. The new Democratic legislative majority could also allow Gov. Ralph Northam to fulfill his long thwarted ambition of bringing Virginia into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative RGGI a compact among nine East Coast states to cap and trade greenhouse gas emissions credits. Northam had failed to get the Republican led legislature on board with his climate goals but he signed an executive order in September mandating that Virginia generate 30 percent of its electricity from renewables by 2030 and generate all power from non carbon emitting sources by 2050. Joining RGGI would be a key way to finance this transition toward cleaner energy with revenue coming from auctioning off carbon credits. Virginias Democratic Party also said that it would refuse contributions from energy providers like Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power that generate power from fossil fuels. Its part of a national campaign from environmental activists to push public officials to say no to money from the coal oil and natural gas industries. Yet in many key races Democrats still out raised their Republican opponents. But the test of these election promises will be in how theyre implemented. Virginia gets 53 percent of its electricity from natural gas and 10 percent from coal so its a long uphill walk to zero emissions. Virginia is just the latest state where limiting climate change has proved to be a winning issue The election results also show yet again that Democrats can campaign and win on aggressive action on climate change. And they illustrate that despite high profile criticism from Republicans the Green New Deal is proving to be popular with many voters even in local elections. Ahead of the election polls showed that more than 60 percent of Virginians wanted their government to do more about climate change. Young Virginia voters said climate change was a top tier concern. Candidates like Joshua Cole who won the election for Virginias 28th House District campaigned on environmental action including upgrading infrastructure to make it more resilient and deploying clean energy. With Congress deadlocked and President Donald Trump pulling the United States out of the Paris climate agreement Virginias election also highlights how the biggest opportunities to curb greenhouse gases are occurring at the state level. States like Oregon New Mexico Colorado and Nevada are already locking in more stringent limits on greenhouse gases and setting higher targets for deploying clean energy. And almost every Democrat running for the White House in 2020 wants to ramp up action on climate change should any of them take office. So climate change is likely to remain a key campaign issue for Democrats in the coming elections.	True	True	False	True	True
The US will consider its interests first as it reviews its climate change policy the secretary of state says. Rex Tillerson told a meeting of the eight Arctic nations in Alaska that the US would not rush to make a decision and would consider their views. President Donald Trump has expressed doubts over the human role in climate change and has said he may pull the US out of the Paris Accord to fight it. Meanwhile other Arctic countries have called for a cut on greenhouse gases. They signed an agreement which stated there was a need for urgent global action. Climate change was the biggest issue at the biennial meeting of the Arctic Council in Fairbanks which was overshadowed by the uncertainties over Mr Trump's policy. Mr Tillerson the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil told the meeting that the administration was reviewing how it would approach climate change. We are appreciative that each of you has an important point of view and you should know that we are taking the time to understand your concerns he said. We're not going to rush to make a decision. We're going to work to make the right decision for the United States. Mr Trump is to decide whether the US will leave or reduce its commitments to the Paris agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which was negotiated by around 200 nations and signed in 2015. An announcement is expected after a trip to Europe later this month. The joint agreement by the Arctic Council mentioned the Paris accord only in a passing reference which noted the deal's entry into force and implementation. But the text did not recommit its members to meet the pledges made. Some climate scientists here in Alaska say they are pleasantly surprised by the relatively tough language on climate change adopted by all eight Arctic Council nations including the United States. The thrust of the text argues Prof John Walsh chief scientist at the University of Alaska's International Arctic Research Center actually echoes the approach of the Obama administration. The acceptance of the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide and pollutants like black carbon and aerosols appears significant. But a couple of things are missing. Although the logic of the statement insists that human activity is causing climate change the word human is not actually present. Nor is there a commitment to implement the landmark Paris accord an omission which is causing alarm among environmentalists. Not only that but many of the Trump administration's early policy decisions prioritised economic growth over environmental protection and Mr Tillerson continues to insist that American climate policy remains under review. So in short it is far too early to conclude that the White House has suddenly been persuaded by mainstream scientific opinion on global warming and with US politics in astonishing flux the Fairbanks Declaration may be no more than a holding statement.

Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz unveiled the Green Real Deal on Wednesday as a free market counterproposal to the Green New Deal being pushed by Democratsto combat climate change. The question for America is pretty simple either we want a bunch of bureaucrats in Washington telling us what we cant do or we empower American innovators to unlock things that we can do the Florida congressman said at a press conference in front of the Capitol building. AOC MOCKS CRITICS OF GREEN NEW DEAL'S ESTIMATED 93 TRILLION PRICE TAG 'THEY SOUND LIKE DR. EVIL' His plan which he is putting forward in a House resolutioninvolves a number of planks including revisitingglobal trade and intellectual property policies to create an international marketplace fair to American innovators. Gaetz's planalso aims to modernize the electric grid which he says currently functions as a wet blanket over American innovation. Gaetz claims that upgrading the grid will create an entire class of energy entrepreneurs across the country. He also wants to unlock federal lands from current regulations saying they can be an open canvas for renewable energy research testing and evaluation. The plan comes in response to the Green New Deal a once fringe policy that seeks to overhaul the nations economy and energy use to combat climate change and combat income inequality. But this year it has emerged in the Democratic mainstream with a resolution introduced in the House and support from most major 2020 Democratic presidential candidates. However a test vote on the proposal recently failed in the Senate with no senator voting to begin debate on the legislation. The proposalincludes a host of costly and controversial big government programs including a push for net zero greenhouse gas emissions universal health care andjob guarantee programs. In the press conference Gaetz made references to FAQs released by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortezs D N.Y. office that said the deal aims to upgrade or replace every building for energy efficiency and render air travel unnecessary while joking about getting rid of farting cows. Do we really believe that if we outlaw cars cows planes and buildings that the rest of the world will follow? he said. Of course not they will laugh at us. While Gaetzs proposal consists of free market and small government ideas of the kind Republicans have long embraced the plan is a notable shift for the party towardtackling climate change in some fashion. Traditionally Republicans have been more skeptical about mans influence on the climate. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler was asked in January at his confirmation hearing if he believed warnings from scientists about the threats of climate change. I would not call it the greatest crisis no he said. In an indication of likely conservative opposition to Gaetz'splan advocacy group FreedomWorks issued a statement calling it a sad example of Republicans thinking theyre conservatives by being slightly to the right of far left. Whats more it is presented as a collection of bold new ideas yet most of them are policies and programs that exist and arent working. This is perhaps the only thing real about the Green Real Deal' the statement said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Gaetzsaid at the press conference that he doesn't think the EPA has done a good job of combating climate change and said he wants to shift the debate among Republicans from focusing on theexistence of climate change to how to combat it. I didn't come to Congress to argue with a thermometer and I think that more of my colleagues need to realize that the science of global warming is irrefutable he said.	True	False	False	False	True

UN climate talks ended Sunday without a full agreement of world powers on how to address the imminent threat of global warming. AP News Frank Jordans and Aritz Parra While the negotiations were meant to shore up the Paris agreement and define the terms on which the signatory countries would reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. But Trump has pulled the US out of the deal unofficially since the US cant formally withdraw until November 4 2020 the day after the American presidential election. Vox Umair Irfan The US along with other major polluters blocked a nonbinding measure that set higher standards for emissions reduction across the world and left little more than a weak call to action in the final declaration of the event. New York Times Somini Sengupta Several other countries who are experiencing climate disasters of their own such as Australia and Brazil also participated in gutting the summit.

Washington CNN Hurricane Florence ravaged Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in North Carolina in September leaving behind an estimated 3.6 billion worth of wreckage. But there's no mention of that in a new Pentagon report detailing the impact of climate change on the defense department. The Report on Effects of a Changing Climate to the Department of Defense does not mention Camp Lejeune the Marine Corps Hurricane Florence or even the threats posed by extreme weather events more destructive storms more intense rainfall that scientists say are more likely given climate change and global warming. Those omissions are just one reason lawmakers greeted the Congressionally mandated report with eviscerating criticism on Friday. The report didn't meet the legal requirement to list the 10 most vulnerable military installations for each service they said. And despite the global impact of climate change it didn't list a single US military installation outside the United States. Lawmakers pointing to President Donald Trump's skepticism about climate change and his administration's steady rollback of measures meant to mitigate the impacts of global warming were scathing. The report is an inadequate incomplete partisan document said Sen. Jack Reed the ranking Democratic member of the Armed Services Committee. We know that climate change is real and impacts the way our Armed Forces carry out their missions in different parts of the globe Reed said in a statement. Former Secretary James Mattis recognized and affirmed this fact. The Pentagon report follows a January study by the Government Accountability Office that found that under the Trump administration the State Department removed guidance to overseas missions on how to include climate change risks in their country strategies particularly in relation to migration. The Pentagon report notes that the department is incorporating climate resilience as a cross cutting consideration for our planning and decision making process and not as a separate program or specific set of actions. Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Mike Andrews said the effects of a changing climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to DOD missions operational plans and installations. But Reed noted that despite legal requirements the Pentagon report simply outlined an alphabetical list of 79 military installations. The report reads like an introductory primer and carries about as much value as a phonebook he said. And Rep. Jim Langevin a Rhode Island Democrat who sits on the House Armed Services Committee said he was deeply disappointed. Langevin noted that the the report comes after a year where the Department suffered nearly 10 billion in damage in just two extreme events at Tyndall Air Force Base and Camp Lejeunetwo installations that were not even evaluated. Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said the report highlights the climate vulnerabilities of the top 79 mission assurance priority installations. By using this alternative approach we are able to highlight where there are operational risks. The Pentagon did not answer multiple questions from CNN including why it failed to meet Congress' request to list the 10 most vulnerable installations why it mentioned no military installations outside the US or why the climate factors it considered did not include extreme weather and why Camp Lejeune isn't listed among the 79 installations. Babb also declined to respond to Reed's criticism. The report acknowledges that the effects of a changing climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to Department of Defense missions operational plans and installations. It looks at the impact of recurrent flooding noting that Joint Base Langley in Virginia has seen a 14 inch sea level rise since 1930. It briefly notes military installations affected drought particularly in the southwest and by desertification. The report touches on wildfires that came close to Space Launch complexes and a southern California base as well as thawing permafrost in Alaska. Although no overseas military installations were listed the report noted the widely recognized impact climate change has on fragile regions particularly in Africa and Asia and the instability and conflict it can create. It lists a few projects the defense department has undertaken with partner countries and notes the need to consider how drought and desertification impact overseas bases and missions. The report also raised very briefly the logistical challenge weather conditions can create for intelligence collection surveillance and reconnaissance as well as recovery and casualty evacuation. And it flagged the way climate change will create new security challenges in the Arctic where melting ice means greater access but also greater international competition for the waterways.

Trump's EPA Plans To Ease Carbon Emissions Rule For New Coal Plants The Trump administration plans to eliminate an Obama era requirement that new coal fired power plants have expensive technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions. This latest administration effort to boost fossil fuel industries comes as leaders from nearly 200 countries are meeting in Poland to discuss how to keep greenhouse gasses out of the atmosphere. And amid reports that CO2 emissions are rising again as well as the administration's own report that climate change is causing more severe weather more frequently and could eventually hurt the U.S. economy. The Environmental Protection Agency proposal would revise its New Source Performance Standards for coal power plants allowing coal fired generators to emit more CO2 per megawatt hour of electricity generated. This would ease an Obama era rule that was a central target in critics' accusations of a war on coal. The coal industry argues the existing Obama administration requirements made it all but impossible to build new coal power plants by requiring costly technologies such as carbon capture and storage. EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler a former coal industry lobbyist echoed that argument in announcing the proposed rule change. By replacing onerous regulations with high yet achievable standards we can continue America's historic energy production keep energy prices affordable and encourage new investments in cutting edge technology that can then be exported around the world said Wheeler. Environmental groups argue that in order to reduce climate change risks the world will have to stop burning coal. They blasted the EPA's announcement. This is just one more foolhardy move by a misguided administration that will be judged harshly by future generations said David Doniger senior strategic director of the Climate Clean Energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. Today's proposal is nothing more than another thoughtless attempt by the Trump Administration to prop up their backwards and false narrative about reviving coal at the expense of science public safety and reality said Mary Anne Hitt senior director of Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign. In fact it's not at all clear if the change would help the ailing coal industry. In recent years it has stopped building new plants and been shutting down old ones instead. The federal Energy Information Administration reports U.S. coal consumption has declined over the last decade and this year is expected to be at its lowest level in 39 years. Even as coal use rises in China and India coal has struggled in the U.S. to compete with cheaper electricity produced from natural gas and renewable energy. But coal industry officials believe this rule change will still help. It does appear that this proposal would make it feasible for new coal plants to be a viable option in the future in the United States says Michelle Bloodworth president and CEO of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. This is the latest in a series of efforts the Trump administration has taken to help the coal business. Previous actions include relaxing Obama era regulations on carbon emissions and mercury emissions as well as rolling back existing regulations that govern coal ash. The EPA will collect public comments on the proposal for 60 days and plans to hold a public hearing on the proposed rule change.	True	True	False	True	True
The study by a team of geographers and archaeologists from UCL and King's College London published in Nature Communications suggests that early pastoralists in North Africa combined detailed knowledge of the environment with newly domesticated species to deal with the long term drying trend. It is thought that early pastoralists in North Africa developed intricate ways to efficiently manage sparse vegetation and relatively dry and low fertility soils. Dr. Chris Brierley UCL Geography lead author said The possibility that humans could have had a stabilising influence on the environment has significant implications. We contest the common narrative that past human environment interactions must always be one of over exploitation and degradation. The fact that societies practising 'pastoralism' persisted in this region for so long and invested both economically and ideologically in the local landscape does not support the scenario of over exploitation. Our study shows that increasing human population and sustainable pastoralism did not accelerateand may even have delayedthe decline of the 'Green Sahara'. Around 8000 years ago the Sahara wasn't desert but instead was a vibrant ecosystem that supported hunter gatherers and fisherfolk. The 'Green Sahara' the colloquial term for the African Humid Period was the period in which North Africa became much wetter than it is today thanks to a series of monsoons. As the Earth's orbit slowly changed the rain started to reduce and the vegetation started to die back. Around 5500 years ago the ecosystem in the Sahara went into a terminal decline towards the desert we have today. Pastoralism nomadic or semi nomadic cattle herders blossomed in the Sahara from around 1000 years before that collapse. Previous studies have put the blame for the collapse of the 'Green Sahara' onto these nomads who have often been marginalised in history but this latest studies dispels that myth. The study uses a novel climate vegetation model to determine whether the end of the African Humid Period occurred earlier than expected. The model keeps track of variables such as vegetation and rainfall and other processes such as the amount of energy coming from the sun and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The model found that the 'Green Sahara' should have collapsed earlier than it did. This suggests that pastoralists lasted longer than expected and the techniques they used helped them to adapt to the environmental changes. Dr. Brierley added Those places where pastoralists last longer are where there are more resources. It's a good adaptation to the climate change taking place at the time. There is now work today looking at what we can learn from nomadic pastoralists such as selective grazing strategies which can be applied to sustainable adaption to desertification that we expect from future climate change. Dr. Katie Manning King's College London concluded Despite the largely inhospitable conditions of the Sahara today it is not hard to find evidence of human occupation from the last 11000 years. Thousands of rock art sites illustrate a lush environment large game hunting and livestock herding. The spread of domestic animals across the Sahara occurred at a time of increasing climatic instability and yet these pastoralist populations thrived. It is likely that strategies used by contemporary traditional herders such as seasonal movement and selective grazing were also used by these early pastoralists helping to maintain an otherwise deteriorating ecosystem.

Newly released emails show senior Environmental Protection Agency officials working closely with a conservative group that dismisses climate change to rally like minded people for public hearings on science and global warming counter negative news coverage and tout Scott Pruitts stewardship of the agency. John Konkus EPAs deputy associate administrator for public affairs repeatedly reached out to senior staffers at the Heartland Institute according to the emails. If you send a list we will make sure an invitation is sent Konkus wrote to the then Heartland president Joseph Bast in May 2017 seeking suggestions on scientists and economists the EPA could invite to an annual EPA public hearing on the agencys science standards. Follow up emails show Konkus and the Heartland Institute mustering scores of potential invitees known for rejecting scientific warnings of human caused climate change including from groups such as Plants Need CO2 The Right Climate Stuff and Junk Science. The emails underscore how Pruitt and senior agency officials have sought to surround themselves with people who share their vision of curbing environmental regulation and enforcement leading to complaints from environmentalists that he is ignoring the conclusions of the majority of scientists in and out of his agency especially when it comes to climate changing carbon emissions. They were obtained by the Environmental Defence Fund and the Southern Environmental Law Centre which sued to enforce a Freedom of Information request. The EPA maintains close working relationships with a broad range of public and private groups and Heartland is just one of many the agency engages with to ensure the public is informed said the EPA spokesman Lincoln Ferguson. It demonstrates the agencys dedication to advancing President Trumps agenda of environmental stewardship and regulatory certainty he said. The public hearing referred to in the May 2017 email was cancelled when the EPA official who runs it fell ill the EPA said. But Bast contended in an email sent to EPA staffers and others that the official called off the hearing after learning that climate change sceptics planned to attend. The Heartland Institute calls itself a leading free market thinktank. It rejects decades of science saying fossil fuel emissions are altering the climate and says on its website that curbing use of petroleum and coal to fight climate change would squander one of Americas greatest comparative advantages among the worlds nations. Of course The Heartland Institute has been working with EPA on policy and personnel decisions Tim Huelskamp a former Kansas Republican congressman who now leads the group said in a statement. They recognised us as the pre eminent organisation opposing the radical climate alarmism agenda and instead promoting sound science and policy Huelskamp wrote. He said Heartland would continue to help Pruitt and his staff. Ferguson said Pruitt and his top officials had also met with groups known for their campaigns against climate changing emissions and pollutants from fossil fuels including the Moms Clean Air Force the American Lung Association and others. But Ben Levitan of the Environmental Defence Fund said mainstream climate change groups have received nothing like the outreach and invitations that Heartland and other hard right groups have been getting. Certainly in some ways this is normal and in the course of business that ebbs and flows with the ideology of the administration in power said Meredith McGehee executive director of Issue One a not for profit group promoting ethical government and bipartisan political reform. An email last February shows Bast forwarded to followers an email with the line From the White House rallying activists to public hearings the EPA was then holding around the country on repealing an Obama era power plan meant to curb fossil fuel emissions. The email is signed by a Pruitt political appointee and gives the name of another EPA official for activists to call. Its not clear from the email however who initiated the attempt to rally conservatives for the public hearing. The Washington Post reported in September that Konkus had been scrutinising grant applications for mentions of climate change which he reportedly calls the double C word. Emails show he and former EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman repeatedly reached out to Heartland to talk over critical coverage by the Post. Lakely the Heartland spokesman responded that he had shared the article with colleagues asking them to jump to your aide sic and defend this position. And an email from Bast shared with EPA staffers and others shows the then Heartland president celebrating news that a reporter Justin Gillis was leaving the New York Times. Ding Dong the Witch is Dead. Still waiting for Chris Mooney and Juliet Eilperin at the WaPo and Seth Borenstein at AP to flame out Bast writes.	True	False	False	True	True
Jellyfish numbers have been increasing rapidly in the Mediterranean and one species that has long been a hazard for bathers there the mauve stinger is increasingly being seen around the British Isles. Now one marine biologist says if we can't beat them we should eat them. I'm hovering in a makeshift kitchen watching one of Italy's most eminent marine biologists gleefully playing chef. Prof Silvio Greco is focused on the bubbling contents of a large pot. Dressed up for the part in chef's whites traditional hat and red apron the sustainable conservation expert is perfect for the role. In this water I have put lemon juice and vinegar. After boiling for a few minutes I will plunge it into this ice he gestures explaining how the hot water both sterilises getting rid of bacteria and destroys the stinging poison. What for some might be food hell has got my tastebuds jumping with curious excitement we're about to eat jellyfish. For Greco it's not the first time. I love seafood he beams. Jellyfish remind me of oysters. When you eat them you experience an explosion of the sea on your tongue. They are after all 90 seawater. Today he's enlisted the professional help of restaurant chef Marco Visciola who confesses he's never cooked jellyfish before. He's going to fry it in a tempura batter made of potato wheat and rice flours mixed with sparkling water. No salt? I ask. Zero he tells me. The jellyfish already has the salty flavour of the sea so to bring out its flavour I've left the batter neutral. This isn't some perverse chef's challenge but part of a campaign that Greco is promoting at the Slow Fish festival. Held every two years at Genoa's porto antico the event encourages sustainable fishing and responsible consumption. There are at least four times as many jellyfish in the Mediterranean now as there were in 2004 with global climate change pollution and overfishing mostly to blame. And the message this cooking demo is sending out is if you can't defeat them eat them. The sea is full of them and it's a big problem for biodiversity says Silvio Greco describing jellyfish as rampant opportunistic species that immediately take over any empty space in the water. He explains how their spread is devastating marine food chains and ecosystems and how illegal fishing of natural jellyfish predators like tuna and turtles has left the coast clear for them to multiply. Now man he concludes must be the new predator of jellyfish. It's an idea the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization is encouraging too. For years fishermen have been finding their nets increasingly burdened with unwanted jellyfish that they simply throw back into the sea. Silvio Greco hopes this will change and says that sustainability aside jellyfish is actually good for you rich in protein and collagen low in calories and fat free. At Slow Fish I discover the eat it to beat it approach isn't limited to the Mediterranean. There's a Caribbean delegation of fishers researchers and marine biologists here to pool ideas on how to fight their worst invasive species the lionfish. They are trying to get it on to menus from Mexico to Honduras Costa Rica to Barbados. Its tender meat which apparently tastes like snapper certainly sounds more appetising than jellyfish. But the jellyfish cooking demo is without a doubt the biggest crowd puller of the entire festival. As the tray of fresh medusa fritta is passed around eager fingers grab the piping hot morsels. I select my piece. The tempura is exquisite cracking seductively between my teeth. I'd expected the jellyfish to be chewy like calamari but it's squidgier. It might just be because I'm hungry but I really like it. A young woman exclaims it's surprisingly nice while a Taiwanese lady tells me jellyfish is a common antipasto back home and she was curious to see what the Italians would do with it. The man beside me is unimpressed. The batter's nice but the jellyfish tastes of nothing and it's slippery he grumbles. I ask a three year old what she thinks. Yummy or yucky? Yummy! she grins at me chewing happily. She was probably hungry too. Marco Visciola has also made a boiled jellyfish salad with rice vinegar sesame oil carrot and cucumber a traditional recipe a Japanese colleague gave him. Again I'm impressed although I think jellyfish's neutral taste or lack of taste could lend itself to any decisive flavours. But Marco's sold. For me it was a new experience and there were a lot of curious people he enthuses adding that he now plans to put locally caught jellyfish on his restaurant's summer menu. It's a novelty a chef can offers diners. I think it will become popular. I'm not entirely convinced. But if you never want another seaside holiday to be ruined by a coastal jellyfish invasion perhaps it really is time to stop fretting and start frying.

Environmental concerns are real but the planet still will be here in twelve years. Imagine theres a movie about a meteor heading toward Earth. It will be here in twelve years. Following Hollywood convention once you got past the part where the maverick scientist or precocious kid discovering it struggles to convince the world about the threat youd expect the president or the military to leap into action. Congress is usually left out of such plots but its not a stretch to imagine that Congress would race to authorize a plan to send astronauts into space to prevent Armageddon or a planetary deep impact. If you dont believe me I refer you to the movies Armageddon and Deep Impact. The initial rollout of the Green New Deal a sweeping proposal to overhaul the U.S. economy and taken seriously society itself was supposed to follow a script like this. The United Nations opened the bidding by announcing last year that we had twelve years to keep the pace of climate change from accelerating too fast to contain the damage. Like a high school game of telephone this quickly became a blanket statement that we have twelve years to save the planet. Climate change is a real concern but if we did absolutely nothing to stop it the planet would still be here in a dozen years. So would the human race and many other living things. In fact if America did virtually everything the Green New Dealers propose global emissions of greenhouse gases wouldnt change that much unless China India Russia and all the African nations followed suit. There are people who nonetheless believe that climate change is a world threatening calamity and that exaggeration is a necessary tool to galvanize public opinion. If you Google the phrase twelve years to save the planet youll find people who think its literally true. The problem is that weve heard these things before. In 1989 a U.N. official predicted entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000. In 2008 Al Gore warned that the northern polar ice cap could be gone in five years. Melting polar ice is something to worry about but its not gone. The reasons this is a political problem for climate change warriors should be obvious. First they are their own worst enemy when it comes to maintaining credibility. By working on the theory that they have to scare the bejeebus out of the public they made it easy for people to dismiss them when their Chicken Little prophecies didnt materialize. Another problem which compounds the first is that they get greedy. Working on the premise that a crisis is a terrible thing to waste progressives have a long record of trying to throw other items on their wish list into the anti climate change shopping cart. The Green New Deal as presented by Representative Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D. N.Y. includes high quality health care for everyone guaranteed jobs paid vacations a living wage and retirement security. Indeed its worth remembering that environmentalists targeted the fossil fuel industry for early retirement long before concerns about global warming were on the agenda. The anti oil campaign began with the Santa Barbara oil spill in 1969 back when concerns about another ice age were still taken seriously. You can believe that climate change is a real problem and also be forgiven for thinking progressives are trying to pull a fast one. This is especially so when you consider that proponents of the GND also favor phasing out nuclear power which could provide vastly more electricity than wind or solar and more efficiently. Which gets me back to where I started. Imagine there was a movie about an incoming meteor that could be stopped only with a nuclear warhead and the heroes insisted that nuclear weapons are just too icky to use even to save the planet. Audiences would scratch their heads. They might also think they missed a crucial plot point if the protagonists proposed a sweeping government effort to stop the meteor and then when given the opportunity to vote for it voted present in protest. Thats similar to what happened this week. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell brought the Green New Deal to the floor for a vote and Democrats refused to vote for it. Instead they harangued McConnell for pulling a stunt. They were right. It was a stunt. But sometimes it takes a stunt to expose an even bigger one.	True	True	True	True	False
The Trump administration spent time last year mulling over what its public position on climate science should be and according to a report published Wednesday by The Washington Post outrightly ignoring new research was one option that officials considered. Citing an internal memo drafted in September by President Donald Trumps then top energy and environmental aide Michael Catanzaro the Post reported that White House officials had discussed whether to consider having a firm position on and a coherent fact based message about climate science specifically whether and to what extent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are affecting the climate system and what level of concern that warrants. Three options were reportedly presented in the memo The first was to conduct red teamblue teamdebates to highlight uncertainties in climate data the second was to review scientific studies under the Administrative Procedure Act and the final option was to simply ignore and not seek to characterize or question the science being conducted by Federal agencies and outside entities. No formal policy ever did materialize from the memo or subsequent discussions on the issue. Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt was reportedly an advocate of holding red teamblue teamdebates to publicly critique climate science but that idea wasultimately blocked by the White House reported The New York Times in March. As the Post noted the Catanzaro memo offers a glimpse into the challenges faced by the Trump administration on the issue of climate change.While White House officials continue to publicly downplay climate data and adopt policies to expand fossil fuel production in the U.S. federal agencies have continued to publish research showing that climate change is real man made and a growing threat to the U.S. On Friday for instance the National Park Service published a report that said the effects of climate change like rising sea levels and intensifying stormscould damage park sites across the country. The reports lead researcher had earlier accused the Trump administration of attempting to censor the study by removing all mentions of human caused climate change. Ignoring the overwhelming evidence only sets us back further in addressing this serious threat said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen D N.H.. Ignore distort or censor. Those are the options the Trump White House is considering to deal with the overwhelming consensus on climate change. Unacceptable and immoral. We need a vision and a plan to not willful ignorance.

The Trump administration has proposed changes to the Endangered Species Act ESA a law credited with keeping hundreds of species from going extinct. The change would eliminate automatic protections for threatened plant and animal species and make it easier for species to be removed from the list. Wildlife conservation groups say the proposed change could have disastrous lasting effects on at risk species. Trump officials say the change will streamline the regulatory process. The proposed change is the latest in a series of White House efforts to remove environmental regulations designed to protect vulnerable species and their habitats as well as leave untouched some of America's most wild places. Environmentalist groups have reacted with outrage and the Center for Biological Diversity said these proposals would slam a wrecking ball into the most crucial protections for our most endangered wildlife. If these regulations had been in place in the 1970s the bald eagle and the grey whale would be extinct today. The Endangered Species Act was signed into law in 1973 by Republican President Richard Nixon and now protects more than 1200 plant and animal species. The list of species is maintained by US Fish and Wildlife and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration which oversees marine species. It has been credited with reviving bald eagle populations and bringing the Yellowstone grizzly bear back from the edge of extinction. Here are several species that could be affected by the change or may not currently exist if it was not for the landmark law. Experts agree that arctic sea ice which polar bears require for fishing and hunting is shrinking which is leading to enormous stresses on the world's largest bear species. The proposed change to the ESA includes a narrowing of the definition of foreseeable future. The US government says they want the language clarified to make it clear that it extends only as far as wildlife officials can reasonably determine that both the future threats and the species' response to those threats are probable. Environmentalists fear the new language will make it possible for government biologists to disregard the long term effects of climate change on the environment. The polar bear could be emblematic of many species being affected by climate change says Bob Dreher of the environmental group Defenders of Wildlife. Whether government biologists will recognise this slow acting but inevitable change in ecosystem because of climate change or wait until more evidence is available is unclear he tells the BBC. The ESA provides blanket protections to species which are categorised as either threatened such as the California gnatcatcher or endangered. Endangered species are those likely to go extinct while threatened species are those likely to become endangered. Under current law both are granted critical habitat protections but the Trump administration wants automatic protections for threatened species to be eliminated and in the future to be considered on a case by case basis. Protections for the California gnatcatcher have barred development across nearly 100000 acres of land in the Greater Los Angeles area according to the Los Angeles Times. If not for their current protections their native habitat would likely become part of more urban sprawl. The sage grouse has been a candidate for protection as a threatened species for nearly a decade but it is unclear if it will ever be added. They as well as the dunes sagebrush lizard have seen their territory encroached upon by human development and have seen decreasing populations in recent years. The distinctive sage grouse return to their breeding grounds known as Leks every year. Biologists believe some Leks can be hundreds of years old. If the sage grouse does achieve threatened status environmentalists fear under the new Trump proposal it would be too late for them to gain the broad protections they need. Although the proposed change would only affect future creatures joining the list Mr Dreher says that if the proposed rules had been in effect in the 1970s animals such as wolves and bald eagles may have been extinct by now. In a significant reversal the proposed change would eliminate language that precludes wildlife experts from considering economic impacts when determining when an organism should be listed. Wolves which were re introduced in the lower 48 states have faced criticism from ranchers and farmers who argue that they have impacted their livelihood by killing their livestock. Re introducing them to the continental US came at great cost and effort says Mr Dreher a former US Fish and Wildlife official. Mr Dreher says that the ESA was designed by Congress to say that the value of life on earth is priceless and that politicians should not have to decide whether it is too expensive to prevent extinction. If we made those decisions you can see under different administrations we would end up protecting nothing. Because who knows what a snail is worth? Who knows what a frog is worth?

The failure of carbon tax proposals to catch on in the U.S. and around the world is prompting environmentalists to give up hope of ever implementing it. Carbon fees were once considered an obvious next step in the countrys multifaceted effort to reduce CO2 emissions. Congresswoman elect Alexandria Ocasio Cortez a rising star on the left believes a carbon tax can be one part of her sweeping Green New Deal. Some conservatives have signed on to the idea believing it to be a market based approach to eliminating pollution. Even a number of major energy companies have come forward in support of charging businesses for the amount of carbon they release into the atmosphere. However carbon tax proposals have proven unsuccessful time and time again. Initiative 1631 for example was supposed to serve as a bellwether for how similar legislation could fare across the country. The bill whichcalled for a 15 fee on each metric ton of carbon emissions was put to the test in Washington state during the 2018 midterm elections. Despite the states Democratic lean and the governors public backing the measure was soundly rejectedin November. It was the second time voters in the state had rejected a carbon fee. Such a proposal being rejected in a blue state doesnt bode well for activists who hope to see it implemented nationwide. If it cant pass in Washington state right now Im not sure that says that theres much of a pathway at this moment nationally Washington Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley said of the outcome. Events across the Atlantic have only worsened prospects for carbon tax supporters. In the face of unprecedented protests the French government has decided to suspend a planned gas tax. President Emmanuel Macros had originally proposed a slew of new carbon taxes intended to wean consumers off fossil fuels and transition to electric vehicles. The price hikes however triggered a wave of intense riots. The protests which have lasted for weeks have even become deadly. One man was caught on video over the weekend losing his hand to a grenade explosion. Theres been a predominant conversation in Washington D.C. thats been led by economists and politicos that have tried to frame a carbon tax as the only way Evan Weber a national political director for the Sunrise Movement said to Politico. Its proved time and time again to be not politically popular and we havent even priced the policy at where economists say it needs to be. The idea that a carbon fee is the way out of this mess is something we need to be pushing back on. RELATED Keep It In The Ground Activists Stormed Trump Administrations Event At UN Meeting Activists will instead focus on other causes near and dear to the environmental movement such as pushing energy standards that mandate a total transition to clean and renewable energy. While many have expressed dissolution over the prospect of a carbon tax future other green activists plan to keep charging forward with their own proposals. Supporters plan to introduce various carbon fee bills across state capitols in 2019 including Pennsylvania New York New Jersey Maryland and New England.

Obviously if the temperature continues to go up at some point it can be harmful or even very harmful the billionaire Republican megadonor said during an interview last week on Freakonomics Radio. But the question is What do we do about it about whatever risk there is? And to me the answer is innovation. On the face of it that admission may seem like a shift coming from a man who with his brother David bankrolled a conservative movement bent on hacking away environmental regulations and helped transform the GOP into the only major political party in the developed world to deny the overwhelming evidence of manmade global warming. But to scientists Koch remains a climate pariah who has learned how to temper his message for audiences who dont buy into the view that industry players are somehow more credible than impartial researchers. Its just no longer credible to deny out of hand that climate change is happening or even that its human caused Michael Mann a climatologist at Penn State University and co author of a new book on climate change denialism told HuffPost on Monday. So the forces of denial the special interests the polluting interests have instead turned to a new talking point that they think they might be able to get away with. When you look at all the climate denial arguments theyre basically the flip of all that Its not real its not us its not bad the experts disagree or the experts are unreliable and theres no hope we cant fix it Cook told HuffPost. You expect them to be moving along that spectrum. But that reasoning which sounds measured compared to outright denial of observable phenomena has been employed for years to undermine climate science and does not represent an evolution on the issue. The spectrum of climate science denialism that argument included has not changed much over the past two decades according to a 2015 U.K. study analyzing 16000 documents from conservative think tanks. The philosophical belief that left alone the free market will produce industries and technologies to curb climate change before it becomes catastrophic is flawed. Economist Milton Friedman the so called patron saint of laissez faire capitalism who popularized the belief that corporations should pursue profit and shareholder value above all argued there is little incentive to preserve the environment without some form of government intervention. You need a price on the emission of carbon if youre going to level the playing field Mann said. Even Milton Friedman understood the existence of market externalities the fact that damage to our environment is not accounted for in the free market without placing some sort of price signal. The most popular solution among economists is putting a tax on carbon emissions. In February a group of Republican elder statesmen introduced a plan for a 40 carbon tax that would be returned to taxpayers in the form of a carbon dividend. A cadre of oil and gas giants including Exxon Mobil Corp. endorsed the proposal earlier this month. But the proposition faces dim prospects of becoming law under the Trump administration which has vowed to pump up the oil gas and coal industries. Booming U.S. oil production bolstered by advancements in hydraulic fracturing or fracking technology has helped keep oil prices low since they plummeted in mid 2014. The price per barrel now hovers just above 40. Without some incentive from policymakers to invest in zero emissions energy such as wind solar or hydropower the world is likely to warm well past 2 degrees Celsius or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. That temperature rise would drastically alter the climate submerge coastal communities and could create up to 2 billion refugees. Both government policy and low carbon technological innovations are going to be critical to keeping warming within 2C James Leaton research director at the U.K. based financial think tank Carbon Tracker told HuffPost by email. Obviously policy and technology interact and cannot be seen in isolation with policy stimulating technological deployment and rapid roll out reducing the future level of policy required. Both can impact the relative financial attractiveness of future energy options. These policies that the U.S. government has others have proposed or promulgated have been just symbolic Koch said in the interview. We oppose all of these because they end up being cronyism. They end up helping certain wealthy people to the disadvantage of the less fortunate. Sometimes the pot calls the kettle black. But in this case the kettle is filled with a solution to clean up the greasy mess left behind by the pot. And the pot is a fossil fuel tycoon with a net worth roughly the size of Bulgarias gross domestic product. Its one thing to be an ignorant fool but its quite something else to allow ones malicious ignorance to potentially threaten the entire planet Mann said. That is what is so pernicious about Kochs continued denial of the threat of climate change and the extent to which they have been able to pollute our entire political discourse by using their political wealth to confuse the public and policymakers about the reality of this existential threat.

The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Changes IPCC newly released climate report once again found little to no evidence global warming caused many types of extreme weather events to increase. The IPCC once again reports that there is little basis for claiming that drought floods hurricanes tornadoes have increased much less increased due to greenhouse gases University of Colorado professor Roger Pielke Jr. tweetedSunday night. For example the IPCCs report noted that there is only low confidence regarding changes in global tropical cyclone numbers under global warming over the last four decades. Pielke pointed out this inconvenient data. Much like the IPCCs 2013 climate assessment the new special report confirmed what Pielke and others have said for years about the relationship between global warming and extreme weather. But dont expect to hear that from many other media outlets especially those that often cite individual weather events as evidence of man made warming. For example The Washington Posts write up of the IPCCs report focused on the mainline findings namely that the world is woefully off target to keep future global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. The New York Times highlighted the IPCCs warning of a world of worsening food shortages and wildfires and a mass die off of coral reefs as soon as 2040. Neither WaPo nor NYT mentioned the reports findings on extreme weather. The IPCCs new report is meant to sound the alarm on global warming ahead of the UN climate summit which is to be held in Poland this December. Delegates are expected to make further commitments to implement the Paris climate accord that calls for limiting future warming below 2 degrees Celsius by 2100. Aside from dire predictions however the IPCCs new report also noted that many types of extreme weather events are not getting worse. RELATED Its The Final Chance We Have To Stop Global Warming Until The Next Chance When it comes to droughts for example the IPCC admits there is low confidence in the sign of drought trends since 1950 at global scale. The report says there are likely to be trends in some regions of the world including increasing droughts in the Mediterranean and decreasing droughts in parts of North America. The IPCC also noted there is low confidence due to limited evidence however that anthropogenic climate change has affected the frequency and the magnitude of floods. The report added that streamflow trends since 1950 are non statistically significant in most of the worlds largest rivers. However the reports authors warned that future warming could exacerbate extreme weather and hurt the global economy. The reports authors also claimed extreme weather had already increased contrary to much of their own evidence. One of the key messages that comes out very strongly from this report is that we are already seeing the consequences of 1 degree Celsius of global warming through more extreme weather rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice among other changes Panmao Zhai an IPCC co chair said in a statement issued Sunday.

Some of us knew this already. Butyou rarely hear itsotrenchantly expressed by a former world leader as it was in London yesterday by Aussie ex Prime Minister Tony Abbott in ahard hitting must read speech for the Global Warming Policy Foundation. Abbott is one of only a handful of world leaders to have spoken out against the global warming consensus. The only other ones recently are former Czech presidentVclav Klaus and of course President Donald Trump. This gives you an idea of just how badly infected are the nations of the free world by the green virus. Even those politicians who might nurture doubts in private almost never express them in public. Abbott himself lost his job as Australias prime minister at least in part because he was found guilty of wrongthink onclimate change which he once famously described as crap.The man who replaced him as prime minister Malcolm Turnbull unfondly known as the Honourable Member for Goldman Sachs is himself a leading tentacle of the Green Blob. Abbotts speech which is causing Australias notoriously left wing media to explode like ripe watermelons struck by hollow point bullets ought to serve as a painful reminder to Australias Liberal party of the talent they lost when they decided to knife this Jesuit trained Oxford educated rock solid family man conservative in the back and replace him with the slippery Davos style globalist Turnbull. Here are some of the highlights Climate change is a product of ignorance and an anti Christian society If science was all about consensus wed still be living in caves Greens want to make life nasty brutish and short Wheres the evidence for climate catastrophe? Theres none in Australia thats for sure Contrary to the breathless assertions that climate change is behind every weather event in Australia the floods are not bigger the bushfires are not worse the droughts are not deeper or longer and the cyclones are not more severe than they were in the 1800s. Sometimes they do more damage but thats because theres more to destroy not because their intensity has increased. More than 100 years of photography at Manly Beach in my electorate does not suggest that sea levels have risen despite frequent reports from climate alarmists that this is imminent. But theres plenty of evidence that green lunacy is killing the Australian economy Renewableshave more to do with virtue signalling than with useful energy Theres a reason renewable energy is crap and its so simple even lefties and greens should be able to understand it Hydro aside renewable energy should properly be referred to as intermittent and unreliable power. When the wind doesnt blow and the sun doesnt shine the power doesnt flow. Wind and solar power are like sailing ships cheaper than powered boats to be sure but weve stopped using sail for transport because it couldnt be trusted to turn up on time. Because the weather is unpredictable you never really know when renewable power is going to work. Its marginal cost is low but so is its reliability so in the absence of industrial scale batteries it always needs matching capacity from dependable coal gas hydro or nuclear energy. This should always have been obvious. We think wererational but where green policy is concerned were little better than the Aztecs Oh and by the way the way were carrying on Western Civilization is on its way out	False	True	False	True	False
Democratic US presidential candidate Joe Biden whose first campaign was sunk by plagiarism has been caught plagiarizing bits of his 2020 climate plan. The campaign claims it merely left out the citations. At least three passages from the climate plan Biden's campaign released on Tuesday were copied directly from environmental organizations CREDO activist Josh Nelson tweeted posting original text from the Carbon Capture Coalition and the Blue Green Alliance alongside text from Biden's campaign website. Compounding the gaffe the Carbon Capture Coalition's membership includes the country's largest fossil fuel companies not such strange bedfellows for Biden who received a D grade from Greenpeace last week largely due to his lack of environmental policy but less than ideal for a candidate trying to reinvent himself as green. Biden's campaign waited the better part of a day to address the charges as the news spread buoyed by anger at the candidate over news he'd lied about marching in the civil rights movement finally telling Business Insider that while they had inadvertently left out several citations from the final version of the document posted to the website it had been updated to include references. Biden's habit of plagiarism dates back to his first presidential campaign in 1988 when he lifted a popular speech from a UK politician that mischaracterized his own family background implyinghe was descended from coal miners and the first in his family to attend university. Caught in a pile of lies the campaign responded with a strikingly similar excuse To the degree it wasn't attributed it was an oversight or inadvertent Biden's 1988 campaign aide told the New York Times. It wasn't the only misappropriated speech Biden made before dropping out of the race he also borrowed one from Robert F. Kennedy the previous year and even plagiarized while at law school complaining when he was caught that his intent was not to deceive anyone. The candidate complained the fuss over his plagiarism was much ado about nothing and blamed rival campaigns for blowing the issue out of proportion. Like this story? Share it with a friend!

After this hurricane season the GOP has a dose of reality they are going to HAVE to take climate change is real and it can and will be destructive. With what basically amounts to a humanitarian crisis going on in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria it cannot be ignored any longer. However with a Trump administration it will be if allowed. Fortunately for the country and the world there are some Democrats who will do their best to stop the Republican party from destroying the Earth with their own blatant ignorance. During a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing on Wednesday Senator Jeff Merkley D OR took EPA appointee William Wehrum to task over his inability to acknowledge that greenhouse gases do have a major impact on temperature. Merkley displayed a chart composed by NASA that showed the relationship between rising temperatures and rising greenhouse emissions. Obviously the chart showed that as greenhouse gas emissions go up so does the temperature. It was a basic question asking if the lines followed each other. A five year old could easily note that they do indeed follow each other. Wehrum tried to sleazily worm his way out of answering the simple question. Merkley interrupted Wehrum and asked him to just look at the lines. Wehrum never did answer the question. Merkley thanked him and then let him have it. He then noted NASA found no correlation between solar activity or volcanic activity however they did find a correlation between carbon dioxide and other global warming gases and the rising temperature of the planet. Merkley continued For the rest of the questioning Merkley continued to show just how woefully ignorant the officials in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency are. The truly maddening part though is that Merkley showed the American people that its not just ignorance its intentional ignorance. They refuse to see it accept being ignorant and continue their refusal to acknowledge that climate change is real and it will have and already has had devastating effects on the planet.

When it comes to unraveling liberal hypocrisy Fox News host Tucker Carlson is arguably the best man for the job. And on his show Friday it took Carlson just 90 seconds to completely dismantle liberal outrage over President Donald Trumps decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement on climate change. Progressives across the country and around the world expressed outrage this week over Trumps decision to withdraw from the agreement. But many of those expressing outrage including world famous Hollywood actors and businessmen typically fly around the world in private jets that expel mind boggling amounts of carbon dioxide the exact substance climate alarmists say is the cause of climate change. Carlson explained on his show Friday that despite the fact that those upset about Trumps decision have not bothered to explain whats actually in the Paris agreement they assure us that that deal is the solution to the single most gravest threat this planet has ever faced rising levels of atmospheric CO2. Theyre dead serious about that. You can tell by the outraged looks on their faces and the purple rhetoric Carlson said. But hold on for a minute. Can we really be sure that these people take carbon emissions seriously? To answer that question Carlson said his team compared what the progressives say to how they live. They examined the lives of billionaire businessmen Richard Branson Elon Musk and Bill Gates in addition to Hollywood superstar Leonardo DiCaprio and Hillary Clinton. Branson says fossil fuels are dangerous and he calls Trumps decision America first Earth last. Now on the other hand Branson owes a Desault Falcon 50EX private jet and it burns more fuel on a single flight to Maui than youre gonna go through in a lifetime of trips to the shore Carlson explained. Elon Musk meanwhile is mad about global warming too. Yet he flies around in a Gulfstream G6500ER. Bill Gates says hes deeply concerned yet he still commutes in a 62 million bombardier BD700 global express. Can you imagine the gas milage that gets? Carlson continued. Leonardo DiCaprio says Trumps move threatens the livability of our planet and yet DiCaprio flew a private jet 4000 miles from Cannes France to New York to accept a climate award and then flew back privately Carlson went on to explain. Hillary Clinton tweeted that Trumps pullout was a historic mistake that leaves American workers and families behind. And yet speaking of workers and their families there probably werent a lot of those onboard last year when Hillary used a private jet to fly 20 miles from Marthas Vineyard to Nantucket for a fundraiser Carlson added. Trump announced his decision to withdraw the U.S. from the climate deal which was agreed to under former President Barack Obama on Thursday.	True	True	False	True	True
A mega blaze raging across a 60km 37 mile front north of the Australian city of Sydney cannot currently be put out fire officials have warned. The blaze across 300000 hectares 1150 sq m is just an hour's drive from the nation's most populous city. People who cannot defend their property from approaching fires have been told they should leave immediately. Since October bushfires have killed six people and destroyed more than 700 homes across Australia. The severity of the blazes so early in the fire season has caused alarm and prompted calls for greater action to tackle climate change. How are animals faring in the fires? Fires have also raged across Queensland Victoria South Australia Western Australia and Tasmania. What's the latest on the ground? Several fires have combined to form the mega blaze north of Sydney although more than a dozen locations are affected across New South Wales. At one point on Friday nine fires had been raised to emergency level warnings although these had decreased markedly amid a brief respite in conditions later in the day. The north Sydney blazes were sending black fumes across the city causing a rise in medical problems. New South Wales Rural Fire Service RFS deputy commissioner Rob Rogers told ABC We cannot stop these fires they will just keep burning until conditions ease and then we'll try to do what we can to contain them. He said the 60km stretch from Hawkesbury to Singleton was just fire that whole way. The RFS website listed five fires roughly in a line from Nullo Mountain to Wollombi as out of control at 0500 local time on Saturday 1800 GMT Friday with another out of control at Green Wattle Creek south west of Sydney. Video footage from the Orangeville area showed firefighters running from a wall of fire and the Walkabout Wildlife Park has evacuated hundreds of animals. The Bureau of Meteorology BOM also said that some fires were too big to put out. Fire officials in Ingleburn warned If your property is not prepared for the bushfire season and you're not sure you are able or capable of defending your property if a fire approaches you need to leave straight away. Firefighters from Canada were briefed in Sydney on Friday and will be deployed across New South Wales over the weekend to be joined by teams from the US. There appears to be little respite. RFS founder and former commissioner Phil Koperberg told the Sydney Morning Herald People are nervous and they have a right to be... the worst is yet to come. Tuesday is the next big concern with temperatures inland of Sydney likely to reach 40C plus. Some firefighters have expressed concern that volunteer numbers might not be enough and that there are inadequate water supplies. One said the fires were all ticking time bombs without rain those fires won't be put out. Sydney may be blanketed in smoke for weeks if not months RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said. Is this fire season particularly bad? It hasn't come close to the fatalities of 2009 when nearly 200 people died but the scale of the damage has been huge. How bad is bushfire smoke for health? More than 1.6 million hectares of land have burned in New South Wales alone. The season has hit earlier than normal and has been exacerbated by drought conditions. Mr Fitzsimmons said There is an absolute lack of moisture in the soil a lack of moisture in the vegetation... you are seeing fires started very easily and they are spreading extremely quickly and they are burning ridiculously intensely. The BOM says that climate change has led to an increase in extreme heat events and raised the severity of other natural disasters such as drought. Last week the bureau noted that NSW had endured its driest spring season on record. It also warned that Australia's coming summer was predicted to bring similar conditions to last year's the nation's hottest summer on record. Australia may see 50C days 'in decades' The government has been criticised over its efforts to address climate change. PM Scott Morrison has dismissed accusations linking the crisis to his government's policies. What could be wiped out by temperature rise Hundreds of bushfire survivors and farmers converged on the nation's capital Canberra this week in protest. One woman displayed the charred remains of her home outside Parliament on which she had written Morrison your climate crisis destroyed my home.	False	False	False	True	True
Thousands of European activists plan to blockade a large German lignite mine this week the latest protest of a growing climate civil disobedience movement. While school students have held Fridays for Future rallies for months protesters of the Extinction Rebellion group launched in Britain have risked arrest with more confrontational protests. From next Thursday to Monday Europe's veteran Ende Gelaende EG anti coal activists will hold their sixth large scale blockade of an open pit coal mine and power plants run by German energy giant RWE. The group's online action consensus says In view of the urgency of the climate crisis we consider it necessary and appropriate to go one step further from public protest to civil disobedience. Here is a look at this growing form of environmental activism. Tadzio Mueller a German organiser of the movement argues that massively breaking the rules ... is the only thing that works to prevent the status quo in the face of climate chaos. Azna Lecuyer of the French branch of Ende Gelaende agrees that we feel a passion for actions of civil disobedience especially among young people. This is reflected in demand for training courses everywhere and by the very rapid rise in skills of new activists. Lecuyer stresses that non violence is part of our action consensus it is forbidden to harm the security forces site employees or to damage the equipment. During past protests at the nearby Hambacher Forest police and RWE company staff have accused the most militant protesters of having hurled rocks or molotov cocktails. The Ende Gelaende movement has distanced itself from those environmental militants and any acts of violence. The EG activistsdressed in trademark white overalls symbolising the toxicity of fossil fuelsplan to march from their protest camp to the Garzweiler mine about 10 kilometres six miles away. They hope to evade police roadblocks and enter the vast open pit mining area to occupy strategic locations and technical infrastructure such as rails access roads and excavators. Meanwhile they plan to organise in so called affinity groups of up to 10 people of similar physical fitnessand a willingness to be arrested for trespassing and other offences. Before the protest activists attend training workshops to learn non violent resistance techniques such as locking their arms and legs in formation with names such as the little train or the turtle. What risks do protesters take? Occupying an industrial site is illegal under German law and volunteer legal advisers are on hand to support activists before and after they are arrested. They advise them to say as little as possible while in custody. Other risks lurk at the Garzweiler site. A vast moonscape like terrain where the surface can be unstable after rain or drought it is criss crossed by high power cables and dug up by building sized excavators. When breaking up protesters' blockades German police have in the past employed high powered water jets and pepper spray. Lecuyer says that some activists experience a form of trauma ... due to the high emotions from stress and excitement and the physical effort because you have to walk for miles in groups to the target pass police roadblocks sometimes under water cannon or pepper spray and then hold the blockade.

California's reign as the U.S. state with the worst air pollution continuesas Los Angeles is again the nation's smoggiest metro area according to a report released Wednesday. LAisn't alone when it comes to smog chokedcities in California seven of the nation's top 10 smoggiest cities are in the Golden State including other sprawling cities such as San Francisco San Diego and Sacramento. Los Angeles has had the worst smog for 19 years of the 20 year history of the report. The bad news came fromthe American Lung Association's annual State of the Air report which covers the years 2015 2017. Smog forms on warm sunny days and is made worse by chemicals that exit vehicle tailpipes and power plant and industrial smokestacks. Warmer temperatures make ozone more likely to form. The report covers the two main types of air pollution that plague the USA smog also known as ground level ozone and soot technically known as particulate matter. Want news from USA TODAY on WhatsApp?Click this link on your mobile device to get started The news isn't any good in California when it comes to soot eitherFresno has the nation's highest levels of that form of air pollution and sixof the nation's 10 sootiest cities are again in California. Soot pollution is deadlier and more of a health hazard than smog causingmore premature deaths and lung cancer the lung association said. California's air quality is worsening despite having the strongest environmental regulations in the nation said John Balmes of the University of California San Francisco at a news conference Tuesday. California's soaring population and topography allow air pollution to overcome the state's strict environmental laws the lung association said. The boom in people brings an increase in cars and trucks on the roads and many of those people live in valleys and basins right where pollution tends to settle. Nearly year round sunny skies don't help Those picture perfect days are a major factor in high levels of ozone pollution. The state would be much worse off without its strict laws on tailpipe pollution and eliminating coal fired power plants. The bad news about air pollutionspread nationwide in thereport Smog and soot choked air is worsening amid heat waves and bigger wildfires as environmental protections are rolled back. Many cities increased the number of days when sootsoared to record breaking levels the report says andmore cities suffered from higher numbers of days when smogreached unhealthy levels. About 141 million Americans live with unhealthful levels of air pollution the report says placing them at risk for premature death lung cancer asthma attacks cardiovascular damage and developmental and reproductive harm. This is a higher number than either of the reports from 2017 and 2018. On the other end of the scale only six metro areas recorded no days when smog or short term soot pollution reached unhealthy levels according to the report Bangor Maine Burlington Vermont Honolulu Lincoln Nebraska Wilmington North Carolina and the Melbourne Florida metro area.

Low lying Pacific atolls United Nations officials warn are on the front line of climate change due to rising sea levels are on the whole stable or increasing in sizeaccording to a study. The study published in the journal WIREs Climate Change in September adds to the growing evidence that small island nations in the Pacific and Indian Oceans are proving resilient to rising seas in the face of predictions they may eventually become uninhabitable. In total 88.6 of islands were either stable or increased in size author Virginie K. E. Duvat of the University of La Rochelle wrote in thestudy. Importantly islands located in ocean regions affected by rapid sea level rise showed neither contraction nor marked shoreline retreat which indicates that they may not be affected yet by the presumably negative that is erosive impact of sea level rise Duvat wrote. That may come as a shock in light of reports that Pacific Islanders in places like Kiribati are becoming climate refugees because of rising sea levels which many scientists blame on greenhouse gas emissions. When the United Nations met in 2015 to hash out the Paris climate accord Kiribati joined other island nations in calling for an international agreement to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. Its a matter of survival former Kiribati President Anote Tong said after meeting with former U.S. President Barack Obama that year. Nearly 200 countries eventually signed onto the Paris climate accord. A 2017 CBS News feature on Kiribatis plight claimed that scientists predict the island nation could be uninhabitable within decades and that high tides that inundate their homes already contaminate their water and kill their crops. However Duvats study found Kiribatis North Tarawa island chain was stable with most islands gaining land and that the South Tarawa chain actually increased in size showing the most growth of any atoll studied. In another case one Maldives official predicted rising sea levels would completely cover this Indian Ocean nation of 1196 small islands within the next 30 years. That warning was made in 1988 amid heightened urgency about global warming. Instead Duvatfound that more than 70 percent of the Maldives Huvadhoo islands were stable and that 6 percent had increased in size and only 23 percent decreased in size. The reanalyzed global data reveal that atolls did not lose land area and that 73.1 of islands were stable in land area including most settled islands while 15.5 of islands increased and 11.4 decreased in size Duvat wrote. Scientists worry that future warming could pose problems for low lying islands many of which are no more than a few feet above the water but other human interventions ocean currents and storms likely exert an even bigger role than climate changes. For example Duvat found that land reclamation and causeway construction caused major changes in island land area and configuration not only in urban but also in rural atolls. Also the removal and the clearing of the native vegetation respectively caused marked changes in island configuration and shoreline destabilization on some islands Duvat wrote. Studies have increasingly shown theres been no widespread disappearance of low lying atolls and coral islands have despite rising sea levels. RELATED North Carolina Gov Roy Cooper Says New Green Policies Will Lessen The Impact Of Hurricanes The United Nations latest reportin October noted that models and other evidence indicate that unconstrained Pacific atolls have kept pace with sea level rise with little reduction in size or experienced a net gain in land. Indeed a February study by New Zealand researcher Paul Kench found eight of Tuvalus nine atolls and three quarters of its reef islands grew over the last four decades. The study findings may seem counter intuitive given that sea level has been rising in the region over the past half century but the dominant mode of change over that time on Tuvalu has been expansion not erosionKench said in February. The U.N. report however also warns that with continued warming Small islands are projected to be at risk and very sensitive to coastal climate change and other stressors. Duvat found only instability on islands smaller than 25 acres but even then only a small number actually decreased in size.	True	False	False	True	False

WASHINGTON The Trump administration has completed its plan to roll back major offshore drilling safety regulations that were put in place after the Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster in 2010 that killed 11 people and caused the worst oil spill in American history. The Interior Departments Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement which was established after the spill in the Gulf of Mexico and regulates offshore oil and gas drilling has finalized a proposal for loosening the regulations as part of President Trumps efforts to ease restrictions on fossil fuel companies and encourage domestic energy production. The rules created potentially unduly burdensome requirements for oil and natural gas production operators on the Outer Continental Shelf without meaningfully increasing safety of the workers or protection of the environment says the new 176 page rule which is scheduled in the coming days to be published in the Federal Register before becoming the administrations final policy. This rule supports the administrations objective of facilitating energy dominance by encouraging increased domestic oil and gas production and reducing unnecessary burdens on stakeholders while ensuring safety and environmental protection the new rule says.

As Hurricane Michael pummeled the Gulf coast a less deadly but equally ferocious media storm formed around Florida Governor Rick Scott whose alleged climate change denial has been blamed for putting Floridians in harm's way. Viral videos New York Times op eds and Guardian contributors all highlighted Rick Scott's backward stance on climate change after Michael a powerful typhoon made landfall along the Florida Panhandle. According to these media reports and commentaries Scott's science denial has endangered Florida residents. In other words if Scott were more vocal about man made climate change Florida would have been better prepared for or perhaps could have even prevented the devastating hurricane. Florida is the state most endangered by climate change declares a video published by Now This. But Gov. Scott's strategy for dealing with it is denial. The New York Times' Nicholas Kristof also took Scott to task for his stance on climate change writing that alas denying climate change doesn't actually prevent it. He added Some folks will say this isn't the moment for politics. But don't we have a responsibility to mitigate the next disaster? It's true that Scott who is currently running for the Senate has shown little interest in highlighting or combating the alleged dangers of climate change. In 2015 after the governor took office the Florida Department of Environment was reportedly banned from using the terms climate change and global warming. Two years later Scott signed a bill that critics dubbed the anti science law which allows residents to file complaints about instructional materials used in public schools. Scott has a section on his website dedicated to environmental issues but it is curiously absent of any direct mentions of climate change. However his website does note that Scott fought to protect Florida's coastline by getting Florida removed from consideration for offshore oil drilling and securing millions of dollars in state funding to help local governments with coastal resilience projects and sea level rise planning. On the campaign trail Scott has dodged questions about climate change resorting to responses such as I'm not a scientist to avoid weighing in on the subject. The motive behind Scott's alleged science denial has also received media attention. Last year the Tampa Bay Times alleged that Scott's personal business ties to the energy industry may be the reason for the state's legislative inaction on climate change. The paper claimed that Scott had hefty investments in petroleum companies that oppose restrictions on greenhouse gases and other environmental regulations. READ MOREHurricane Michael shuts in 40 off Gulf of Mexico oil production The Florida governor hasn't been the only one singled out by the media for his backward views however. According to The Guardian anyone who isn't a fervent believer in man made climate change is to blame for Hurricane Michael even the hurricane's victims. Victims of Hurricane Michael voted for climate deniersreads the headline an op ed published in The Guardian on Thursday. Elections have consequences. Denying science has consequences. And we are reaping what we sow the subhead states matter of factly. The headline was later amended to Victims of Hurricane Michael are represented by climate deniers. Climate deniers are making these storms worse by stopping action on climate change. What the hell do we expect to happen when the deniers are writing the laws? the commentary penned by John Abraham a professor of thermal sciences asks rhetorically. Social media users appeared to largely line up behind the allegations hurled at Scott although some seemed unconvinced that the governor was at fault. Rick Scott can ban the term all he wants in FLORIDA. Climate change is real one Twitter user wrote. He's bought and paid for claimed another. Others were less accusatory. It's not our words that are negatively affecting the atmosphere. It's the damage we are doing to the planet one Twitter user noted in response to the Now This video. Lol. Like the weather would give a crap if he went mute a netizen observed. At least six people have been killed as a result of Hurricane Michael the third most powerful storm ever to hit the US mainland according to officials. The hurricane made landfall as a Category 4 storm but later weakened to a Category 1 on Wednesday night. As Hurricane Michael gradually loses strength however it appears that the media storm over the consequences of climate change denial is only growing. Will the devastation wrought by Michael and all future hurricanes be laid at the feet of science deniers? Like this story? Share it with a friend!	True	False	False	True	False
Environmentalists in California are willing to let the state dictate how they cook in their own kitchens in an attempt to save the planet. Thirteen cities and one county in California have put in place zoning codes encouraging or requiring all electric new construction virtually banning builders from running natural gas lines into homes and apartments to fuel appliances including stoves and ovens. USA Today reported that people believe the move is necessary to fight climate change with an eye toward creating fewer legacy gas hookups as the nation shifts to carbon neutral energy sources. For natural gas companies its a threat to their existence. And for some cooks who love to prepare food with flame its an unthinkable loss. Natural gas is a fossil fuel mostly methane and produces 33 of U.S. carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Carbon dioxide is the primary greenhouse gas causing climate change. Theres no pathway to stabilizing the climate without phasing gas out of our homes and buildings Rachel Golden of the Sierra Clubs building electrification campaign said. This is a must do for the climate and a livable planet. But the page linked to on the U.S. Energy Information Administration EIA website is referring ironically to CO2 emissions from the U.S. electric power sector by source for 2018. The new codes call for replacing gas with electricity. The federal website reports on the benefits of using natural gas as an energy source Burning natural gas for energy results in fewer emissions of nearly all types of air pollutants and carbon dioxide CO2 than burning coal or petroleum products to produce an equal amount of energy. About 117 pounds of carbon dioxide are produced per million British thermal units MMBtu equivalent of natural gas compared with more than 200 pounds of CO2 per MMBtu of coal and more than 160 pounds per MMBtu of distillate fuel oil. The clean burning properties of natural gas have contributed to increased natural gas use for electricity generation and as a transportation fuel for fleet vehicles in the United States. Probably the biggest stumbling block for most pondering an all electric home is the prospect of not having a gas stove USA Today reported. Its the only thing that people ever ask about Bruce Nilles who directs the building electrification program of the Rocky Mountain Institute a Colorado based think tank that focuses on energy and resource efficiency said in the USA Today report. According to a 2017 kitchen study by the NPD Group 35 percent of U.S. households have a gas stove while 55 percent have electric. But the number of natural gas customers is also rising USA Today reported. The American Gas Association which represents more than 200 local energy companies says an average of one new customer is added every minute. Thats exactly the wrong direction Nilles said. The idea that denying access to natural gas in new homes is necessary to meet emissions reduction goals is false American Gas Association President and CEO Karen Harbert. In fact denying access to natural gas could make meeting emissions goals harder and more expensive. They also say its more expensive to run an all electric home USA Today reported. A study by AGA released last year suggested that all electric homes would pay 750 to 910 a year more for energy related costs as well as amortized appliance and upgrade costs. USA Today also pointed out that California is not the only place where people want more government regulation. New York Hawaii Colorado and Maine have carbon neutrality goals and as many as 140 U.S. cities have similar plans.	False	False	False	False	False
At a Tuesday afternoon event rolling out the new policy Administrator Scott Pruitt invoked a biblical tale from the book of Joshua in which the pagans are instructed to choose this day whom you will serve either God or the gods of your fathers. As it relates to grants from this agency youre going to have to choose said Pruitt who described the new rule as a way of ensuring theres integrity in the process and that the scientists that are advising us are doing so without any kind of appearance of conflict. Pruitt described scientists who received as much as 77 million in grants from the agency while also serving on advisory boards as damaging the perception of independent rule making. Pruitt signed an order cementing the new rules into policy during the 28 minute event with Sen. Jim Inhofe R Okla. and Rep. Lamar Smith R Texas two of the most ardent climate change deniers in Congress at his side. Administrator Pruitt is purging expert scientists from his science boards and replacing them with mouthpieces for big polluters Sen. Tom Udall D N.M. said in a statement. Now instead of independent science guiding the way hired guns for industry will be steering EPA policy on central issues affecting clean air clean water and public health. Pruitt said nothing of industry funded science which has long been used to kneecap regulations. For many scientists working in a time of limited research budgets funding from the EPA or other government agencies is one of the few sources available other than industry money. Wholly unaddressed by the directive is any counterpart prohibition on scientists funded by industries with conflicts of interest from serving as EPA advisors Richard Denison a lead senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund wrote in a blog post. When it comes to advice the agency receives the core concern over the need to avoid conflicts of interest is this Is advice tainted because the entity employing and paying the advisor stands to gain or lose financially from the agency decision that is under advisement? The advisory boards which Congress created as a check on EPA policies and regulations include the EPA Science Advisory Board the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee CASAC and the Board of Scientific Counselors. Pruitt said he plans to announce new members of the boards next week after scientists began quitting the councils in protest earlier this year. While Pruitts new order rejects anyone who receives funding from the agency he has named industry allies to those same boards. As part of the announcement he tapped Michael Honeycutt the head of the Texas Commission on Environmental Qualitys toxicology division to serve as the head of the Science Advisory Board. Honeycutt once suggested the health risks linked to smog were overstated described ozone standards as alarmism that made no biological sense because most people are indoors for 90 percent of the time and blasted the EPA for relying on epidemiological studies that he considered not scientifically rigorous. In 2010 the Texas Observer called him a crony of then Gov. Rick Perry R and accused him of abusing science.Honeycutt relied heavily on research produced by Michael Dourson whose consultancy Toxicology Excellence for Risk Assessment was described in 2014 by InsideClimate News as the one stop science shop favored by the chemical and tobacco industries. Pruitt picked Dourson to lead the agencys chemical safety division last month. Pruitt also tapped Tony Cox who runs the private consultancy Cox Associates and produces research for major industry groups to lead the CASAC. He has done research on lung disease issues for the American Chemistry Council a trade group for the chemical industry and research on health effects associated with fine particulate matter and ozone for the American Petroleum Institute the oil industrys main lobbying group according to The Intercept. In 2015 he railed against the EPAs plans to tighten rules on ozone emissions. Pruitt appointed Paul Gilman as the head of the Board of Scientific Counselors.Gilman currently serves as the chief sustainability officer at the waste management and incinerator company Covanta.He has been a leading advocate for incinerating trash as a source of fuel for electricity. The trash incinerator industry provides only a tiny fraction of U.S. power but wields outsize influence in some cities and hasattempted to sabotage the U.S. Conference of Mayors effort to push for 100 percent renewable energy. Scott Pruitt doesnt want to listen to a word from anyone who isnt in the pocket of corporate polluters Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said in a statement. For Pruitt anything that helps corporate polluters make money is good and science and facts are just roadblocks he wants to tear down.	True	False	False	True	False
For conservatives seeking a major victory a great place to start would be to fix the mess of energy subsidies and regulations that have accumulated over the past eight years. In the years since Barack Obama took office there were 548 billion in energy and environment regulations finalized and the projected budget currently estimates at least 250 billion in federal energy subsidies. Attempts to eliminate these regulations and subsidies have been hampered by conservatives lack of an overarching vision for energy policy. While the Left is happy to use regulation to promote specific forms of energy they find ideologically appealing the response from conservatives all too often has been to weakly offer the all of the above catchphrase as a counterweight. Even worse conservatives sometimes have played the Lefts game in reverse using government to promote their own favored forms of energy rather than to promote competition and markets. For example while criticizing the tax credits for wind and solar power conservatives have embraced subsidies for carbon capture and sequestration and government regulation on nuclear insurance. Conservative principles uphold free markets competition and the rule of law yet too many conservatives are content to get their electricity from regulated monopolies or build infrastructure under outdated regulatory approval processes that take on average 70 months to complete. While conservatives can be bellicose about ending the war on coal they have placed far less emphasis on the benefits of policies to improve liquidity in natural gas markets. Responding to challenges in the energy sphere one issue at a time results in many conservatives missing the forest for the trees and not talking enough about what pro market energy policy looks like. Unwittingly in conservatives quest for equal treatment of different energy sources they have adopted policies that reinforce governments role in dictating energy outcomes. Even when Republicans showed budget discipline in 2015 by finally putting a sunset on several production and investment tax credits they did so without ending all subsidies for wind and solar. The result is entrenched government preference for already mature wind and solar technologies and stymied competition from emerging technologies such as fuel cells and geothermal that would benefit the most from the tax credits. Conservatives sorely need to define an energy narrative rooted in market principles. It should be one that centers on quality institutions and policies that leverage competition and consumer choice. Markets not mandates or subsidies will drive cost reductions innovations and deployment of clean technologies. An incrementalistic approach one that seeks to level the subsidy playing field or merely to pare back Obamas regulatory legacy will do little to foster the conditions needed for the sorts of innovation that both the Right and Left seek. Progressives who favor heavy regulation and energy subsidies had a field day during Obamas presidency. However regulators likely overstated the net benefits of regulations and the Clean Power Plan would have accomplished little at high cost while proving legally vulnerable and politically unstable. An analysis of President Obamas environmental legacy by the American Action Forum found the negative effect of regulations on economic growth led to forgone environmental benefits richer economies tend to value clean air more and emit less relative to production and led to regulations that were about half as effective as claimed on paper. Subsidies also have been inefficient. The National Academy of Sciences found that production and investment tax credits for wind and solar reduced carbon dioxide emissions at a cost of a whopping 250 per ton. A 2015 Congressional Budget Office report acknowledged that tax credits are less effective at achieving policy goals than alternative market driven policies. An AAF analysis of tax credits for renewables found the costs to taxpayers rose at a faster rate than the renewable energy output indicating declining performance of the subsidies. The Lefts focus on energy policy has been costly with poor outcomes. The Democratic party has an official policy to cut pollution from energy use through regulation and subsidies yet another AAF analysis revealed no pathway exists to achieve those stated objectives via regulation. Even assuming the targets were achievable at costs similar to past regulations the economic costs of the regulatory burden would exceed 7 trillion. Conservatives should seek opportunities to shed regulations and subsidies in favor of market oriented policies. This means a plan to phase out distortionary tax preferences completely. Expanding full cost expensing in the tax code would boost RD fairly and efficiently. Additional RD benefits would come from shifting Department of Energy priorities from applied research toward basic research. Opportunities to cut red tape abound from hydroelectric and advanced nuclear licensing to modernizing the Clean Air Act. Removing regulatory barriers to entry for unconventional technologies such as energy storage in wholesale electricity markets would help level the playing field. Rethinking counterproductive energy efficiency regulations which reduce incentives for innovation and risk taking with new technologies should also be a part of the equation. Conservatives should also protect and enhance competitive energy markets. A report from the R Street Institute found that competitive electricity markets cut costs while boosting innovation and environmental quality. Strengthening these markets while minimizing political interventions like power plant bailouts is crucial to the performance of the electricity industry. Improving rules that affect price formation in electricity markets will also help stimulate efficient investments. Conservatives have an opportunity to retake the energy narrative with a platform that favors competition and choice. It would be a return to conservative basics where industries and technologies excel on their merits not political popularity. In so doing conservatives will advance the American economy and their political interests well into the future. Philip Rossetti is a data analyst at the American Action Forum Devin Hartman is electricity policy manager and senior fellow with the R Street Institute.	False	True	True	True	False
NASA robotic missions to Mars have revealed a world with an amazingly complex history including periods in which it was much warmer with oceans volcanoes and was habitable for many types of simple Earth life. Even now Mars still has abundant subsurface water and organic compounds. NASA is planning a human mission to Mars for the early to mid 2030s and if our history of space exploration is any guide Mars will have many interesting surprises in store for the first humans to set foot there. A human mission to Mars will be complex expensive and very dangerous.Sending humans to Mars and returning them safely to the Earth will be among the most difficult projects ever undertaken. But what should happen after that first step? The most obvious first task in developing an extended presence on Mars is reconnaissance probably carried out with extensive use of miniature drones. It will be essential that we map and evaluate all possible resources that could be useful. These resources will include water whether ice in the top few meters below the surface or liquid water that would exist deeper. Naturally occurring materials such as metals can be used in construction of habitats tools fuel etc. NASAs Mars Curiosity scientists recently announced the discovery of complex organics in the soil. These organic compounds would be essential for hydroponics as Mark Whatley did in wonderful and reasonable accurate movie The Martian. As a side product of growing green planets is that photosynthesis will provide a source of oxygen for breathing. The early Mars colonists will be intently focused upon building safe resilient and sustainable habitats. Whenever humans leave the Earth they must take along a bubble of Earths environment which includes breathable air. Mars has an atmosphere but it is only about 1 percent of the air pressure that exists at sea level on Earth. Furthermore the atmosphere on Mars is almost entirely carbon dioxide CO2. There is only a very tiny amount of oxygen the most important gas that humans need. Fortunately it is relatively straightforward to make oxygen from water and we now know that Mars has abundant water present as a permafrost layer underneath much of the surface. There are several dangers that would face the colonists. These include micrometeorites which burn up in Earths upper atmosphere and ultraviolet radiation from the sun that is blocked by our stratospheric ozone layer on Earth. Mars does not have such an ozone layer. So habitats must be shielded and perhaps built in naturally occurring caves and lava tubes. Imagine an opportunity of building an entirely new world from scratch! As long as the colony is safe and resilient and as long as the resources are available almost anything could be possible. Mars could provide a venue for experimenting with new types of government education societal structures or even recreation. Ultimately once colonies are stable Mars itself could be used as a base for further exploration of the outer solar system. As the early colonists develop a more robust presence they will then be able to devote more effort to establishing further goals. These might include the development of profitable industries for trade with Earth or experimenting with new technologies that might have applications for life on Earth. They could search for life underneath the surface of Martian as has been suggested by the methane plumes that are emitted seasonally from the underground or in the nearby asteroid belt or the moons of Jupiter. Imagine the new types of recreation that might be possible on Mars. Imagine skiing down the slopes of Olumpus Mons the largest extinct volcano in the solar system where the ski slopes are hundreds of miles long. Imagine hang gliding from cliffs six miles high! On Mars the intrepid explorer might delve into caves ancient lava tubes that are hundreds of meters across. Perhaps the most exciting recreation will be exploring that new world. Who knows what we will find there! Michael Summers is a professor of planetary science and astronomy at George Mason University.

During an interview with CBC the new US ambassador to Canada Kelly Craft claimed she believes both sides of climate science. Asked Do you believe in climate change? Craft responded I believe there are scientists on both sides that are accurate. Do you believe there is science that proves that man is not causing climate change? the interviewer followed up. Well I think that both sides have you know their own results from their studies and I appreciate and respect both sides of the science Craft said. Though several members of the Trump administration including President Trump himself continue to cast doubt on humans role in the changing climate without providing any evidence its simply not a matter on which scientists disagree at all. The latest National Climate Assessment written by more than 300 scientists at 13 US federal agencies including the Department of Defense and NASA for instance opens with the statement Earths climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization primarily as a result of human activities. The report goes on to detail the toll climate change has already taken on health quality of life and the economy of the US and how those impacts will mount if emissions are not dramatically reduced in the coming years. With continued growth in emissions at historic rates annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century more than the current gross domestic product GDP of many U.S. states according to the assessment. The Trump administration released the report ahead of schedule on the Friday after Thanksgiving a move many interpreted as an attempt to bury the findings. The facts of climate science and the urgency of the climate threat to the US are a nuisance to an administration that has consistently prioritized the demands of the fossil fuel industry to roll back federal policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. And Trump has appointed a number of officials like Craft whose allegiance to industry is clear. In 2016 Craft reportedly donated 265400 toward Trumps election and 17000 to the Republican National Committee. Crafts husband Joseph Craft is a billionaire coal magnate. A Global News report from 2017 provides some details about him While the Crafts have a personal financial stake in pushing climate denialism other prominent Republicans have tried to tamp down on the conclusions of the Climate Assessment by citing concerns about the impact curbing greenhouse gas emissions would have on industry and jobs. But as Voxs David Roberts has detailed there is no consistent evidence that environmental regulations cause long term changes in overall employment.	True	True	False	True	True
An aerial view ofthe Antarctic Peninsulas Larsen C ice shelf. According to NASA IceBridge scientists measured the Larsen C fracture to be about 70 miles long more than 300 feet wide and about a third of a mile deep. Photo John SonntagNASA via AP In the six days before President Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change an enormous crack in an Antarctic ice shelf grew 11 miles according to a report by British Antarctic research group Project MIDAS. The crack which is located in Larson Shelf C leaves only eight miles of ice connecting what could be one of the worlds largest recorded icebergs to Antarctica. When it eventually breaks free from the continent the resulting iceberg will measure 31000 square miles represent 10 percent of the ice shelfs original mass and be larger than the state of Rhode Island. The growth spurt between May 25 and May 31 was the largest they have observed since January Project MIDAS says and the inevitable splintering of Ice Shelf C will drastically alter the landscape of the continent and will make the ice that remains less stable. The group states that although this specific crack was not likely caused by climate change the disintegration of Antarctic ice shelves contributes to rising sea levels that threaten coastal cities. When ice shelves disappear ice can flow faster from the land to the ocean and contribute more quickly to sea level rise Adrian Luckman and Martin OLeary of Project MIDAS wrote in February. Rising sea levels endanger heavily populated cities such as New York San Francisco New Orleans and Miami and are predicted to cause 13.1 million Americans to relocate from coastal areas by 2100. Concern about rising sea levels was one of many factors that inspired the Paris Agreements goal of limiting the rise of global temperatures. Project MIDAS expects the ice shelf to mimic the break up of Larson Ice Shelf B which shattered over a period of two weeks in 2002. The calving event will probably be slow and graceful the scientists of Project MIDAS wrote. The ice is already floating so when the fracture breaks all the way through it will simply start to drift away. The group is unsure exactly when the rapidly growing crack will cause Ice Shelf C to break free from Antarctica but believes that the rift has now reached a region of soft ice and that there is very little holding the ice shelf together. We are watching with bated breath the teamwrote.	False	False	False	True	True
As India's north continues to struggle with extreme pollution levels the story has put a fresh spotlight on air quality in cities across Asia. Beijing has long been notorious for its smog but statistics show that India Pakistan and Bangladesh have worse air by far. So why is South Asia so much more polluted? Of the world's most polluted 30 cities 22 are in India according to research by IQ AirVisual a Swiss based group that gathers air quality data globally and Greenpeace. The remaining eight cities are all in Pakistan Bangladesh and China but the list doesn't include Beijing which comes in at number 122. Just looking at global capitals it's also Asian cities that top the ranking. Looking at overall countries it's Bangladesh that has the worst air followed by Pakistan and then India. All these rankings are based on average air quality per year. As these countries have very different densities of measuring stations and transparency of data the statistics have to be read with a degree of caution. But they certainly indicate an overall trend. The fight against air pollution in three global cities Why is India worse off than China? Pollution in urban areas is usually a mix of different factors mostly traffic fossil fuel burning power plants and heavy industries. What differentiates China from India is that in the latter there is still a lot of burning of agricultural stubble when farmers want to clear their fields. The burning usually takes place in autumn. In this episode the big problem really seems to have been the agricultural burning assistant professor Thomas Smith of the London School of Economics told the BBC. That's one thing that China has tackled. All agricultural burning has been banned full stop. A global overview for fires and thermal abnormalities is made available by Nasa and allows users to track developments over past days and weeks. The area north west of Delhi shows a highly unusual concentration of fires Prof Smith points out. And you can't underestimate how important agricultural burning is even though people often think only of cars and heavy industry as the causes. In the wake of the pollution spike India's Supreme Court ordered a stop to stubble burning in the states around Delhi. But the city's situation is made worse by the colder winter air which is more stagnant trapping the pollutants in place. Prof Smith also points out that while India is largely reactive Beijing tends to be more proactive and preventative to try to stop the problems from happening in the first place. What does pollution feel like? Pollution levels are categorised by measuring the levels of dangerous particles in the air. The result is then classified on a scale from good to hazardous. The effect of pollution is different for every person explains Dr Christine Cowie of the University of New South Wales. Some people complain about irritation to the eyes to the throat exacerbations of wheeze and asthma symptoms. Coughing is certainly also a very common symptom even in non asthmatic people. And of course it's the elderly who suffer the very young and people with pre existing respiratory illnesses like or heart problems. She explains that even a short exposure to the unhealthy or worse pollution levels can trigger an asthma attack or increase the risk of a stroke. The longer the exposure the greater the risks. And the ways to protect oneself are limited. There's the advice to stay indoors to reduce physical exercise and to wear a mask but in many poorer parts of the world none of these options really work for regular people. It is toxic air says David Taylor professor of tropical environmental change at the National University of Singapore. It must be very uncomfortable especially if you're having to work outside and if you're having to do jobs that require quite a lot of energy. You feel like it's hard to breathe agrees Prof Smith. It's like doing hardcore exercise when you just take a walk outside. And depending on the kind of pollution you can of course also smell it in the air. How does it compare to Europe or the US? Today pollution levels in Europe Australia and the US are significantly lower than the extreme readings that India has experienced in the past few days. But it's not always been like that. London for instance was notorious for its pollution during much of the 19th and early 20th centuries. As late as 1952 the so called Great Smog covered London with a thick toxic layer of pollution bringing the city almost to a standstill for days not unlike the situation in Delhi now. It's thought to have resulted in thousands of deaths. While London experienced a different mix of pollutants it probably wasn't far off what's currently happening in Delhi says Mr Taylor. Back then power stations along the Thames were major polluters of the British capital. In fact much of what we know today about the health impact of air pollution dates back to the experiences of the London smog during those years.	False	True	False	True	False
Joe Biden has been roundly mocked on Twitter after making the unlikely claim to a young activist appealing for a presidential debate on climate change that he kicked off the whole global warming movement back in the late 1980s. A young activist from US Youth Climate Strike asked Biden if he would support a presidential climate policy forum organized by the group. Biden interrupted the girl before she was finished asking By the way did you know Im the guy who did all this? Read Real Clear Politics it will tell you about how I started this whole thing back in 1987 climate change. Social media users were quick to criticize Bidens response with some mocking him for saying he had started climate change and others pointing out that his 1987 effort didnt really work out so well. Biden has repeatedly boasted of his 80s climate change concern telling voters he was the first to introduce a climate bill. In 1987 Biden delivered a Senate speech warning of the dangers of global warming and his Global Climate Protection Act called for setting up a task force to plan to tackle the issue. While he is the first to have a climate bill passed he certainly isnt the first politician to raise the alarm about climate change let alone have started the whole thing. Congressman Al Gore held House hearings on climate change in 1976 and as a senator introduced a resolution calling for a research program into greenhouse gas emissions in 1985. The following year Republican Senator John Chafee held Senate climate hearings warning of the serious problem and featuring an expert explaining that significant warming could happen within 5 15 years. Biden has been criticized for reportedly planning a middle ground approach to climate policy that is accused of lacking urgency and not going far enough. Think your friends would be interested?

Reuters Hurricane Irma will pose the toughest test yet for U.S. nuclear power plants since reactors strengthened their defenses against natural disasters following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. Irma was on course to hit South Florida early on Sunday after slamming Cuba as a Category 5 storm. It weakened to a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 130 miles per hour 210 km per hour on Saturday but was expected to strengthen before reaching Florida bringing a storm surge to a state home to four coastal nuclear reactors. The National Hurricane Centers forecast track shows Irma making landfall on the southwest side of the Florida Peninsula west of the two nuclear reactors at the Turkey Point plant. The operator Florida Power Light FPL has said it will shut Turkey Point well before hurricane strength winds reach the plant. The reactors are about 30 miles 42 kilometers south of Miami. FPL said it will also shut the other nuclear plant in Florida at St Lucie which also has two reactors on a barrier island on the states east coast about 120 miles 193 km north of Miami. We will shut the reactors down 24 hours before Category 1 force winds are forecast to hit FPL Chief Executive Eric Silagy told a news conference. FPL said both Turkey Point and St Lucie were designed to withstand storms stronger than any ever recorded in the region and both plants are elevated 20 feet 6 meters above sea level to protect against flooding and extreme storm surges. But South Miami Mayor Philip Stoddard said he was concerned about the potential for floods to damage power generators at Turkey Point which in turn might threaten the ability of the plant to keep spent nuclear fuel rods cool. At Fukushima in Japan an earthquake and tsunami disrupted power supplies and caused the fuel in some units to meltdown. The whole site is pretty well able to handle dangerous wind the real problem from my perspective is water Stoddard said. He said he was more worried about the nuclear waste than the reactors. The real question is can they keep the spent fuel cool. Peter Robbins an FPL spokesman said Mayor Stoddard is wrong. Turkey Point is safe and is ready for Hurricane Irma. U.S. nuclear operators have taken steps to improve preparations for disasters since Fukushima. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission NRC required plants to install portable pumps and generators to keep water moving over fuel rods and the spent fuel pool even if offsite power supply was lost. Nuclear plants also hired more staff and stored equipment needed to deal with reactor problems. Things are better today than in March 2011. Time will tell whether better proves good enough said Dave Lochbaum director of a watchdog group the nuclear safety project at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The NRC said it was posting more inspectors at the two Florida plants and was considering sending more inspectors to plants in Georgia and South Carolina should the storm head that way. The NRC said the plants should not be compromised by Irmas storm surge. The storm surge forecasts that we have seen so far do not challenge the sites designs said NRC spokesman Scott Burnell. Both Florida plants have previously weathered major storms. Turkey Point took a hit from Hurricane Andrew a Category 5 storm in 1992 damaging a smokestack at fossil fuel plant at the site. Repairs cost about 90 million. St Lucie withstood the back to back impact of Hurricanes Frances Category 2 and Jeanne Category 3 in 2004. FPL shut St Lucie last October as Hurricane Matthew skirted the Florida coast. Lochbaum said the NRC and the industry could do more to reduce vulnerability to flooding. In January 2014 about 50000 gallons of rainwater leaked into the St Lucie plant after a heavy downpour. An NRC study blamed degraded and missing flood seals that were not discovered during checks after Fukushima. There is also spent nuclear fuel at the site of a third power plant in Florida which stopped operating in 2009. That is the Crystal River plant owned by Duke Energy Corp. Duke is in the process of transferring used fuel from the spent fuel pool at the plant to dry cask storage as part of work to decommission the plant. Once in storage the fuel no longer needs cooling. The NRCs Burnell said Duke has suspended work to transfer the rods ahead of Irma. He said the fuel was safe and the plant also has backup power even though it has been shut for years. Irma is expected to disrupt much of Floridas power supply. FPL the states largest electric company has warned Irma could cut service to about 4.1 million of its nearly 5 million customers. FPL is one of four large publicly traded utilities in Florida. Other natural disasters since Fukushima have shut some plants. An earthquake in Virginia in 2011 shut Dominion Energy Incs North Anna plant for about 2 12 months the time it took to complete a full damage inspection. That plant sustained no major damage. Hurricane Sandy in 2012 caused three reactors in the U.S. Northeast to shut but inflicted no serious damage.	False	False	False	True	True
In the last year alone California has seen catastrophic wildfires burn thousands of acres. On Tuesday the ongoing Camp Fire in Northern California became the state's deadliest blaze in history. How do these deadly fires start and why is California so susceptible? Officials define wildfires or wildland fires as any fire occurring on undeveloped land. Forest fires are uncontrolled wildfires burning in lands covered at least in part by timber or flammable vegetation. In nature two things can spark wildfires lava and lightning. According to the National Park Service 90 of wildfires in the US are caused by humans whether by unattended campfires burning debris cigarettes or arson. About 2 of California's 2816 wildfires in 2016 were caused by lightning according to data from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Cal Fire. The majority could be attributed to humans though only 8 were caused by arson. According to Prof David Peterson of the University of Washington a former senior researcher with the US Forest Service fires in the region have not necessarily increased in frequency in the last 100 years but the area affected has. The area burned annually has been higher during the past 30 years or so he told the BBC. It should be noted that 2 of fires burn 98 of the area. In California recent years have seen a combination of extremely high temperatures strong winds a long drought and population growth causing lethal fast moving blazes. Last year the state had over 9500 wildfires that burned over a million acres according to the National Interagency Fire Center and had the highest number of homes and buildings lost in one state. And straying away from natural burning cycles has also contributed to the lethality of recent fires Prof Peterson says. Keeping fires from starting in Western forests has caused fuel to accumulate far beyond historical levels. Therefore when fires occur they can burn hotter he says. These high intensity fires can cause rapid and in some cases long term changes in vegetation making it more difficult for the ecosystem to recover. Once evacuation orders are issued by local law enforcement residents generally have hours to leave Cal Fire information officer Kathleen Schori told the BBC. But in those initial stages of fire you may have minutes she added. Fleeing in a vehicle is ideal as most wildfires cannot be outrun. But the Camp Fire's especially rapid spread fuelled by high winds made the situation even more dangerous. This fire moved so fast I don't think anybody did anything wrong Ms Schori says when asked whether those forced to abandon vehicles and escape on foot could have acted differently. During the initial phases it was burning 80 miles in an hour. She stressed the importance of following evacuation orders immediately especially with fast moving blazes. If you don't evacuate and it becomes a rescue situation then our firefighters are taken away from the firefight and moved to the rescue. Sometimes you do fight fire with fire. In addition to old fashioned water and flame retardant delivered from ground level and above the flames by aircraft sometimes firefighters have to burn more to quell the flames. Intentionally burning areas around a wildfire can help starve the blaze and control its direction. Clearing out brush and flammable material from an area to create firebreaks is another way to achieve the same. Ninety eight percent of fires are small andor suppressed quickly Prof Peterson says. The other 2 are very challenging when they get large and are almost impossible to put out at least until it rains. Ms Schori of Cal Fire said that with wind driven blazes like the Camp Fire officials often have no choice but to wait for conditions to improve. There are never enough firefighters to combat a fire that's moving as fast as this was moving she says. You have to deploy your resources on each side of the fire and continue to construct lines. And when that wind stops then you can safely get in front it. Prof Peterson says there is no hard evidence that climate change has affected US wildfires yet. We expect that there will be significant effects in future decades as the climate continues to warm he told the BBC. A warming climate Prof Peterson explained would increase the duration of the fire season and more droughts would in turn create more wildfire fuel. Globally the length of the wildfire season has already increased by nearly 19 between 1978 and 2013. By around 2050 fires may burn two to three times more area than they have historically. According to 2017 data from Verisk Analytics 4.5 million US homes were in areas of high or extreme wildfire risk and over 2 million of those homes were in California. Damage caused by wildfires has cost 5.1bn in the last decade Verisk found. In California homeowners who do not qualify for private insurance coverage can opt into a statewide pool called the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements FAIR plan. FAIR is comprised of all property and casualty insurers in California and is not run by a state agency.	False	False	True	True	False
WASHINGTON Michigan GOP Rep. Tim Walberg isnt concerned about the effects of climate change if it exists because God will take care of it. Walberg was speaking to constituents in Coldwater Mich. last week when he was asked about climate change. Walbergwho has previously questioned the existence of global warmingfirst joked that he could take some global warming at home in Michigan because it was too cold and some global cooling in Washingtonbecause of the humidity. Walberg then conceded that the climate was changing before adding that wasn't anything new. I believe theres climate change Walberg said according to a video of the exchange obtained first published by the Huffington Post. I believe theres been climate change since the beginning of time. I think there are cycles. Do I think man has some impact? Yeah of course. Can man change the entire universe? No. Why do I believe that? he continued. Well as a Christian I believe that there is a creator in God who is much bigger than us. And Im confident that if theres a real problem he can take care of it. On Thursday afternoon President Trump is expected to announce whether the United States will remain a member of the Paris climate agreement. Trump hasnt announced whether hell make good on his campaign promise to leave the pact which includes every country besidesSyria and Nicaragua but multiple outlets have reported he's leaning towards dropping out.

PAHOA Hawaii Reuters A large explosion in Hawaiis Kilauea volcano on Wednesday may mark the beginning of more violent explosive eruptions that could spray rocks for miles kilometers and dust nearby towns in volcanic ash and smog the U.S. Geological Survey said. Kilauea Hawaiis most active volcano erupted on Thursday and a powerful earthquake shook the crater the next day. Lava flows from fissures on its flank have destroyed at least 36 homes and other buildings and caused the evacuation of some 2000 residents. The USGS warned that more violent eruptions at the crater could begin mid May shooting rocks weighing several tons for over half a mile 1 km hurling pebble sized projectiles several miles km and dusting areas up 20 miles 32 km away with ash. This is the first of perhaps more events like that to come Tina Neal the scientist in charge of the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said on a conference call of Wednesdays blast which shot projectiles from the crater. The town of Hilo some 25 miles 40 km northeast of Kilauea on Hawaiis Big Island and the village of Pahoa 24 miles 39 km east could be exposed to volcanic air pollution or so called vog and a layer of ash should explosive eruptions begin and prevailing wind directions shift Neal said. Such steam driven explosions would be triggered by water running into the craters falling lava lake should it drop below the level of groundwater. Geologists cautioned that Kilaueas past explosions had been relatively small on a global scale and while ash from the volcano posed a nuisance as an eye and respiratory irritant it was not a serious health hazard. We dont anticipate there being any wholesale devastation or evacuations necessary anywhere in the state of Hawaii said Donald Swanson of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory.USGS Hawaii County Civil Defense said all 1900 residents of the Leilani Estates and Laipuna Garden areas around 25 miles 40 km east of the crater had been evacuated. Lava oozing from two new fissures in the area had paused but sulfur dioxide gas was still a hazard. Exposure to very high levels of the gas which causes acid rain can be life threatening according to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. Evacuee David Nail was anxious to learn if his house had been destroyed. He was asleep on the couch when a fissure opened up 2000 feet 610 meters away spewing out lava and gas. It sounded like 10 or 20 jet engines said Nail. The 57 year old who recently retired to the area from Orange County California said he had seen drone footage showing lava flowing up his driveway causing two propane tanks to explode. He tried to reach his house on Tuesday but he and his neighbors were blocked by a 20 foot tall 6 meter tall wall of lava. All we could do was sit there and cry he said. Fourteen fissures have opened since Kilaueas vents started spraying fountains of lava up to 300 feet 90 meters into the air on Thursday and about 104 acres 42 hectares of land have been covered with lava. Kilauea has been in a state of nearly constant eruption for 35 years. It predominantly blows off basaltic lava in effusive eruptions that flow into the ocean but occasionally experiences more explosive events. A powerful magnitude 6.9 earthquake on the volcanos south flank shook the area on Friday. It was the second largest of the last century in Hawaii. More earthquakes and eruptions have been forecast perhaps for months to come. Hawaiis Volcanoes National Park where Kilauea is located remains open to tourists albeit with some restrictions.

There are growing fears that the unchecked use of antibiotics in both medicine and agriculture will have adverse effects on the environment and on human health AFP PhotoLOIC VENANCE Paris AFP Residues from billions of doses of antibiotics painkillers and antidepressants pose a significant risk to freshwater ecosystems and the global food chain a new analysis said Thursday. There are growing fears that the unchecked use of antibiotics in both medicine and agriculture will have adverse effects on the environment and on human health. When animals and humans ingest medicines up to 90 percent of active ingredients are excreted back into the environment. Many medicines are simply discarded in the United States alone an estimated one third of the four billion drugs prescribed each year ends up as waste. The Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development OECD compared data on concentrations of pharmaceutical residue in water samples worldwide as well as prescribing trends and water purification regulations in various countries. One study cited in its report estimates that 10 percent of all pharmaceuticals are potentially harmful to the environment including hormones painkillers and antidepressants. The OECD said that antibiotic use for livestock is predicted to rocket by more than two thirds in the next decade stoking concerns over antibiotic resistance. Human prescriptions are also set to drastically increase according to the report. We're seeing constant engineering of new pharmaceuticals and seeing clinical practices evolve to include recommendations of earlier treatment and higher doses said the lead report author Hannah Leckie. Another study cited said extremely high concentrations of pharmaceutical products had already been detected in water ways in China India Israel South Korea and the United States. In Britain alone ethinyloestradiol diclofenac ibuprofen propranolol and antibiotics are now present in the run off of 890 wastewater treatment plants at high enough levels to cause adverse environmental effects according to another study. The residues of pharmaceuticals have been detected in surface and ground water across the world said Leckie. However there's still a lot we don't know about their occurence and know even less about the concentrations we find. More than 700000 people already die each year from drug resistant infections. As the global population grows and ages and prescribing rates continue to climb that figure is set to hit 10 million annually by 2050 higher than the number of people dying from cancer. Unless adequate measures are taken to manage the risks pharmaceutical residues will increasingly be released into the environment as ageing populations advances in healthcare and intensification of meat and fish production spur the demand for pharmaceuticals worldwide the report said. And the situation is set to get even more acute as climate change increases the spread and frequency of infectious diseases such as malaria and dengue. Leckie said there was something of a vicious circle when it came to medical prescriptions and climate related disease. Human activity such as population growth and transport combined with climate change increases antibacterial resistance... and therefore the need for more pharmaceuticals.	True	False	False	True	True
U.S. Formally Begins To Leave The Paris Climate Agreement The Trump administration has formally notified the United Nations that the U.S. is withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement. The withdrawal will be complete this time next year after a one year waiting period has elapsed. We will continue to work with our global partners to enhance resilience to the impacts of climate change and prepare for and respond to natural disasters Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement Monday. Nearly 200 countries signed on to the agreement in 2015 and made national pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Each country set its own goals and many wealthy countries including the U.S. also agreed to help poorer countries pay for the costs associated with climate change. The U.S. is now the only country to pull out of the pact. The United States is not cooperating with the rest of the world on dealing with climate change says Andrew Light a former climate official in the State Department who helped develop the Paris Agreement. The agreement was designed to be easier to join than to leave. The U.S. even helped spearhead language that would hold countries accountable for the promises they made in part to help guard against regime changes and other global political turmoil. Indeed in the years since the pact was created many key international players including Brazil China Japan and India have experienced economic or political upheaval but none has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement as a result. President Trump originally announced his intention to withdraw from the deal in the summer of 2017 shortly after he took office. At the time he said As of today the United States will cease all implementation of the agreement including federal policies meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as U.S. contributions to the international climate fund for poorer nations. These agreements are just only as good as the commitments from each country Light says. The U.S. had pledged to reduce national greenhouse gas emissions by about a quarter by 2025 compared with 2005 levels. The country is not on track to achieve that goal. In the intervening years the Trump administration has systematically attempted to roll back federal limits on carbon emissions including rules about how much pollution can be emitted by power plants cars and trucks. The reality is to really deliver on our climate goals we do need strong federal action says Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Concerned Scientists. The unfortunate reality is U.S. carbon emissions actually rose last year. This isn't the first time the U.S. has reneged on an international climate agreement. The U.S. failed to ratify the 1997 Kyoto Protocol despite being instrumental in its creation. In this case the U.S. became a signatory to the agreement but almost immediately signaled that it didn't intend to pursue its responsibilities. In both cases the U.S. was instrumental in developing the international strategy. That's one of the ironies of all this Light says. When the Paris Agreement was being negotiated the U.S. delegation pushed for more transparency and accountability to make sure the countries that signed on would actually do what they promised. Even though we're the ones who have been pointing to these potential scenarios for problems with other countries we seem to be the biggest problem Light says. If we were a tiny country with small emissions it wouldn't matter so much he says. But we're not. We're a big country with a lot of power and a lot of influence around the world. And so for us to be the exception on this issue is holding the world back. A formal withdrawal is reversible however if a future administration chooses to rejoin the Paris Agreement and pick up where the U.S. left off with its emissions reduction promises.

Its been repeated throughout the media Future global warming could wipe out one tenth of the U.S. economy by 2100. Its a top line finding of a major government climate report but its based on a study funded by groups affiliated with two major Democratic donors. The oft repeated claim also stemmed from a global warming projection thats come under increased scrutiny from experts including one who called it outlandish. The federal government released the second volume of the National Climate Assessment NCA Friday. The federal report issued dire warnings including from ice sheet disintegration on accelerated sea level rise leading to widespread effects on coastal development lasting thousands of years. The report also claims that global greenhouse gas emissions is expected to cause substantial net damage to the U.S. economy throughout this century including a 10 percent hit to gross domestic product GDP in one extreme scenario. RELATED Trump Touts Oil Prices Getting Lower As Millions Hit The Road For Thanksgiving However NCAs dire prediction of a 10 percent hit to U.S. GDP comes from a 2017 study supported by the charitable foundations founded by major Democratic donors. The study was also funded by other organizations including theNational Science Foundation the U.S. Department of Energy and the Skoll Global Threats Fund. That 2017 study published in the journal Science was funded in part by Bloomberg Philanthropies and Next Generation which were founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and San Francisco billionaire Tom Steyer respectively. University of Colorado professor Roger Pielke Jr. pointed out problems with the study on Twitter Saturday including the fact it was funded by groups connected with Bloomberg and Steyer. Bloomberg and Steyer were the biggest donors to Democratic aligned political action groups in the 2016 election cycle according to the Center for Responsive Politics CRP. Bloomberg who founded Bloomberg Philanthropies handed nearly 60 million to liberal SuperPACs to help put Democratic candidates in office and defeat Republicans in the 2018 election cycle according to the CRP. Steyer who co founded Next Generation gave roughly 58.7 million to liberal SuperPACs according to CRP. Bloomberg and Steyer back the Paris climate accord and Obama era policies to phase out fossil fuels. The Bloomberg Steyer funded study found future temperature rise could cost roughly 1.2 of gross domestic product per additional one degree Celsius increase on average. At the most extreme high end that could add up to 10 percent of GDP by 2100. Pielke called the use of such an extreme scenario embarrassing because its based on a future thats 15 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in other words twice what the United Nations most extreme scenario projects. But even the United Nations worst case scenario called RCP8.5 is being called into question by experts. A study published in 2017 found RCP8.5 was exceptionally unlikely because it suffered from systematic errors in fossil production outlooks. Imagine if research funded by Exxon was sole basis for claims. Given weaknesses of the work its just foolish to lean on it so much Pielke tweeted. Major media outlets however did no such examination of the NCAs reliance on such an outlandish claim as Pielke called it. CNN reported the economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars or in the worst case scenario more than 10 of its GDP by 2100. The news outlets headline warned future warming could also kill thousands. All told the report says climate change could slash up to a tenth of gross domestic product by 2100 more than double the losses of the Great Recession a decade ago The New York Times reported of the NCA. Andrew Light a distinguished senior fellow at the World Resources Institute and reviewer of the chapter highlighting the Bloomberg Steyer funded study did not respond to The Daily Caller News Foundations request for comment. Instead Light forwarded TheDCNFs request to the U.S. Global Change Research Program USGCRP which is responsible for producing the NCA. USGCRP has yet to respond to TheDCNFs request. The NCA was put together with input from 13 federal agencies and outside scientists.

Back in October 2015 Barack Obamas EPA finalized a 460 page rule titled Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines for Existing Stationary Sources Electric Utility Generating Units aka the Clean Power Plan. This was a part of Obamas pen and phone way of ruling the country. As an aside did you ever see anyone on the left bitch about Obama using the power of the presidency to make policy and weigh in on political and cultural issues the way some on the right bitch about Trump doing it? Did you ever stop to wonder what they know that the current belly achers dont? The purpose of this rule was breathtaking. Using the anthropogenic global warming scaremongering and specious public health predictions the Clean Power Plan essentially put the US coal industry out of business. Since that time the rule has been mired in court challenges and it produced the first instance in history where the Supreme Court presumed a rule was unreasonable before a lower court ruled on the issue The Supreme Court dealt a blow to President Obamas signature climate change initiative Tuesday by halting the administrations effort to reduce pollution from coal fired power plants while a legal battle rages on. The move by the courts five conservative members was a shock to environmentalists who had hoped the justices would deny as a federal appeals court did last month a petition filed by 29 mostly Republican led states and industry leaders. Now the Environmental Protection Agency must halt enforcement of the so called Clean Power Plan until the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit decides on the merits of the GOP industry lawsuit against it. Oral arguments are set for early June. Even if the plan is upheld at the lower court it could not be implemented until the Supreme Court has had the final word. That likely would push the battle into 2017 or beyond. In September 2016 then candidate Donald Trump gave an economic policy speech in which he specifically targeted the Clean Power Plan Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said he would repeal four key Environmental Protection Agency regulations as president leading one environmental group to call his plans a dumpster fire. During an economic policy speech in New York Trump said he would eliminate the Clean Power Plan and the Waters of the United States rule. In a fact sheet released accompanying the speech Trumps campaign said he would scale back the latest regulations on ozone pollution and eliminate the EPAs Renewable Identification Number program which is part of the Renewable Fuel Standard program. Trump said the regulations harm U.S. businesses and getting rid of them would help kick start the economy. This Obama Clinton directive will shut down most if not all coal powered electricity plans in America Trump said of the Clean Power Plan. Theyre shutting down all over the country. Remember what Hillary Clinton said? She wants to shut down the miners just like she wants to shut down the steel mills and steel workers. In late March President Trump signed an executive order directing the EPA to review the Clean Power Plan Now it is reported that tomorrow the EPA will being the process of withdrawing the Clean Power Plan. What the EPA is doing is proposing a rule to rescind the existing rule and then it will undertake another administrative rule making process to ask for public input on what a new rule should contain and finally a new rule will be drafted. Im sure Scott Pruitt would prefer to scrap this whole thing unfortunately the US Supreme Court 2007 decision Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency says that EPA regulation of carbon dioxide is actually required by the Clean Air Act and so non regulation is legally off the table unless Congress acts that was a joke. The sum total of this is to take this issue out of the courts and then give the environmental nazis a new chew toy to play with for several years. In the meantime hopefully Congress will act again that was a joke to limit the reach of the Clean Air Act and the ability of activists to use that law to wreak havoc on our economy and communities.

If the world wants to limit climate change water scarcity and pollution then we all need to embrace flexitarian diets say scientists. This means eating mainly plant based foods and is one of three key steps towards a sustainable future for all in 2050 they say. Food waste will need to be halved and farming practices will also have to improve according to the study. Without action the impacts of the food system could increase by up to 90. Fast on the heels of the landmark report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC comes this new study on how food production and consumption impact major threats to the planet. The authors say that the food system has a number of significant environmental impacts including being a major driver of climate change depleting freshwater and pollution through excessive use of nitrogen and phosphorous. The study says that thanks to the population and income growth expected between 2010 and 2050 these impacts could grow between 50 90. This could push our world beyond its planetary boundaries which the authors say represent a safe operating space for humanity on a stable Earth system. However the study finds that no single solution will avert the dangers so a combined approach is needed. So when it comes to climate change the authors looked at what they called a flexitarian diet. We can eat a range of healthy diets but what they all have in common according to the latest scientific evidence is that they are all relatively plant based said lead author Dr Marco Springmann from the University of Oxford. You can go from a diet that has small amounts of animal products some might call it a Mediterranean based diet we call it a flexitarian diet over to a pescatarian vegetarian or vegan diet we tried to stay with the most conservative one of these which in our view is the flexitarian one but even this has only one serving of red meat per week. If the world moved to this type of diet the study found that greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture would be reduced by more than half. But as well as altering diets the research says that farming practices need to change significantly. This involves boosting yields from existing cropland improving water management and restricting and recycling fertiliser use. We looked at improving agricultural yields in particular of more health sensitive crops like fruit vegetables and legumes said Dr Springmann. In the past there has been lots of invest in the stable grains like maize and corn but now we really need to move it to the crops we need more of. We also looked at increasing the efficiency of water use and we looked at better monitoring and recycling of fertiliser lots of it is lost and it runs off into rivers and causes dead zones in the oceans. In addition the study found that halving the amount of food lost to waste would reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture by 16. Tackling food loss and waste will require measures across the entire food chain from storage and transport over food packaging and labelling to changes in legislation and business behaviour that promote zero waste supply chains said Fabrice de Clerck director of science at EAT who funded the study. The key element is that these three solutions must be implemented together. Feeding a world population of 10 billion people is possible yet only if we change the way we eat and the way we produce food said Johan Rockstrm director designate of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research who is one of the authors of the study. All measures combined can result in keeping healthy both planet and people. The study has been published in the journal Nature.	True	False	False	True	False
Greta Thunberg tried really hard to keep her zero emissions promise but it has collapsed like all hypocritical left wing plans because it was just too difficult. From the Hill Greta Thunbergs plan for carbon free travel was contradicted when her sailboat captain flew across the Atlantic Ocean to pick her up. Thunberg 16 has been on a tour of North America to raise awareness for climate change. As part of her pledge to cut back carbon dioxide emissions to save the planet Thunberg vowed not to travel by air to limit her carbon footprint while she tours. The plan for zero emissions travel was subverted when Thunbergs yacht captain Nikki Henderson 26 flew to the United States from England burning roughly two or three tons of carbon CO2 in the process. Thunberg and her father who has traveled North America throughout his daughters activist tour could have flown aboard the same flight and burned just as much CO2. Ironically she failed because of left wing communist protesters in Chile Henderson was forced to make the flight last second because protests in Chile caused the U.N.s Cop25 climate summit to be moved to Madrid Spain. Thunberg was set to speak at the conference but needed to leave the U.S. sooner than expected. I mean you really think the entire world is going to come to a screeching halt for carbon emissions when you cant even organize a publicity stunt with your own standards? No wonder celebs opt to be complete and utter hypocrites instead of actually trying to get carbon neutral. And we all kinda see what is happening here if they cant do it now then why would we believe that they would be carbon free after they force all of us to live in backwards slums?

Leading climate scientists have warned that geoengineering research could be hijacked by climate change deniers as an excuse not to reduce CO2 emissions citing the US administration under Donald Trump as a major threat to their work. David Keith a solar geoengineering GE expert at Harvard University has said there is a real danger that his work could be exploited by those who oppose action on emissions at the same time as he defended himself and colleagues from the claims GE strengthens the argument for abandoning the targets set by the Paris climate agreement. One of the main concerns I and everyone involved in this have is that Trump might tweet geoengineering solves everything we dont have to bother about emissions. That would break the slow moving agreement among many environmental groups that sound research in this field makes sense Keith said on the sidelines of the Climate Engineering Conference CEC in Berlin. Indeed utterances from people in or close to the Trump administration most notably GE proponent secretary of state Rex Tillerson who has referred to climate change as just an engineering problem make it clear they either tacitly or directly support the idea of climate engineering. Earlier this year Keith a professor of applied physics at Harvard announced plans to conduct an outdoor trial into stratospheric aerosol injection involving launching a high altitude balloon that will spray a small quantity of reflective particles into the stratosphere. Keith believes the experiment may help to measure the feasibility and risks involved in GE an umbrella term for a range of techniques to deliberately adjust the climate in an effort to mitigate global warming. They include reflecting sunlight from space adding huge quantities of lime or iron to the oceans pumping deep cold nutrient rich waters to the surface of oceans and irrigating vast swaths of desert to grow trees. Supporters of research into geoengineering argue that its techniques roughly speaking divided into carbon dioxide removal CDR or negative emission technologies which removes greenhouse gases and solar radiation management SRM or solar geoengineering which reduces the amount of solar energy warming the planet could help to lessen some of the consequences of climate change. However the common consensus is that the techniques should be used in addition to reductions in CO2 emissions. This weeks conference drew attention to the huge risks involved. All the techniques being proposed have potentially severe environmental impacts said Silvia Ribeiro of the ETC Group leading campaign monitors of new technologies and their possible impact on the worlds poorest. They also ignore the question as to why theres not enough political will to have done more to tackle climate change until now and they in turn serve to justify the inaction she added. Concerns focus on techniques such as stratospheric aerosol injection which some experts say has the potential to reduce the amount of rain from Asian and African monsoons and could have a devastating impact on the food supply of billions of people. Aerosol injection also has the potential to reduce the ozone layer and heighten the risk of exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Other possible side effects of GE may be an increase in ocean acidification a change in weather patterns a rapid rise in temperatures and a huge uptake in the use of agricultural land all of which could prompt mass migration of millions of climate change refugees. But scientists such as Keith and Mark Lawrence scientific director of the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies IASS in Potsdam argue that with the Paris agreement goals to limit temperature rise to two degrees or less almost impossible to achieve the world has little choice than to thoroughly explore technical intervention and the potential it has to avoid global disaster. It will be very difficult to achieve the Paris agreement calls without some form of climate engineering Lawrence said. Its not impossible but its hard to imagine we would make the major changes in our infrastructure and lifestyles in the time necessary. Keith also dismissed the view that climate engineers like himself were on a mission to prove that climate engineering worked at all costs or else see the importance of decades of their lifes work evaporate. At the best climate engineering is a supplement and it could be that we shouldnt do it he insisted. Our work is to inform better choices and it would actually be very useful to know for sure it didnt work. Right now there are heads of state and others in leadership who are explicitly assuming it could work that its there if we need it. But lets say we found something deep in the climate models which suggested we were overoptimistic about solar geoengineering then I would say abandon it. That would be great. Id love to publish that.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his climate change minister Catherine McKenna are both disappointed over President Donald Trumps decision to break with the Paris climate accord. Trudeau and Trump exchanged words over the phone on Thursday night when the prime minister expressed his disappointment with the presidents decision according to a news release from the Prime Ministers Office. Through crestfallen Trudeau reiterated to the president Canadas continued commitment to working internationally to address climate change. This is about an ambitious and unshakable desire to leave a cleaner healthier and more sustainable planet for our kids and for generations to come. Despite the lofty objectives when Trudeau signed the Paris accord he was widely criticized in Canada by environmentalists for selling out to an agreement that they said was far too lenient on greenhouse gas producers. Nonetheless Liberal Environment and Climate Change Minister Catherine McKenna also found Trumps resolve to extricate the U.S. from the accord deeply disappointing and even suggested that the president will be missing out from the inevitable increase in green energy jobs that climate change proponents believe will soon be mushrooming around the world. The clean growth economy is where the world is going and Canada is going to be part of it McKenna said Thursday on Parliament Hill. Canada wants to create good jobs and wants to grow our economy and create opportunities for business. We want to be there we want to be providing solutions for the world. We know where were going. However the U.S. move might well affect Trudeaus plans to implement a national carbon tax and his overall environmental agenda that many critics say will make the Canadian economy less competitive than its American counterpart. With the North American Free Trade Agreement on the cusp of renegotiation environmental policy could well become integral to reaching a new agreement.	True	False	False	True	True
The generation that has grown up with the constant drumbeat of manmade climate change is now shaping public policy including some young conservatives who have launched a nationwide campaign in support of a carbon tax. The Thomson Reuters Foundation reported on the campaign which runs counter to the stance of the Republican Party and President Donald Trump that the issue is more about globalization than saving the planet Drawn from Republican groups on more than two dozen university campuses the Young Conservatives for Carbon Dividends called for laws to tax oil natural gas and coal producers of planet warming greenhouse gases. The taxation plan would make fossil fuels more costly while the resulting revenues would go to taxpayers. We claim to be the party that cares about the future that our children will inherit and we need climate policy that reflects that said Kiera OBrien 21 a senior at Harvard University who co founded the group. We are offering up what we see as the common sense solution and the way forward for the party OBrien said in the Reuters article. The article pointed out that Trump has rejected the climate doomsday scenario and has instead acted to help the U.S. energy sector by slashing regulations and withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord both policies aimed at helping American workers and the economy. The college Republicans behind the carbon tax campaign said the Party should have ahead of the 2020 election a climate change plan in place. Their plan includes an initial 40 a ton tax on carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas at mines wells and ports where products are produced. That tax rate would increase over time according to Reuters. OBrien said the plan includes a family of four receiving 2000 a year from the carbon tax revenues to help with higher energy costs. The plan harnesses the power of the free market to solve climate change through innovation OBrien said. Our plan would provide incentives for companies and individuals to lower emissions in ways they think are best. The campaign will connect young conservatives with Republican lawmakers around the country to talk about climate policy. At least one older Republican backs the idea. The key here is the dividend back to the people former Sen. Trent Lott R MS who supports the young group told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Its not sustainable for Republicans through the leadership to say We just dont want to talk about this' Lott said.	False	False	False	False	False
It was clear Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke felt at home Tuesday addressing representatives of the industry that was a top donor to his congressional campaigns. Its the same industrythat the Trump administration has worked so hard to prop up over the last two years and that Zinke now regulates as chief steward of Americas natural resources. I see a lot of familiar faces he told the National Petroleum Council during its meeting in Washington D.C. before launching into a series of go to talking points about the importance of producing domestic energy namely fossil fuels and downplaying the dire conclusions of a recent federal climate report. We want to embrace better stewardship. We want to embrace reliability. In order to get there we have to understand the technology. And in order to understand it quite frankly we have to work with you he said. Ive been criticized for saying we want to work with you. Ill take the criticism. Zinke was referring to controversial comments he made in September during a keynote speech at the Louisiana Oil and Gas Associations meeting in Lafayette Louisiana. Our government should work for you he told the oil and gas trade group according to a post by the association. As head of the Interior Department Zinke oversees some 500 million acres of land or one fifth of the United States and 1.7 billion acres on the Outer Continental Shelf. Its a job that comes with the sometimes conflicting tasks of preserving and protecting public lands and waters for future generations while also setting the policies that govern extracting natural resources from them. Zinke has said that hes succeeded in striking the right balance but conservation efforts have taken a clear backseat as the administration has pushed forward with its energy dominance agenda. There were moments during Tuesdays speech where Zinke sounded like a seasoned oil man. He said he is bullish on energy and expects that within two years the U.S. will be marching real close to producing 14 million barrels of oil per day. And he agrees with Russian President Vladimir Putin that 60 per barrel is a good spot to keep the economic engine in good shape he said. Weve gotten a lot better as industry Zinke said quickly correcting himself. Youve gotten a lot better. He pointed to energy producers success with domestic shale production noting that companies have been able to turn a profit on oil from the Bakken fields in Montana and North Dakota when prices have been at around 30 per barrel. That he said shows you how good we are and efficient we are. Zinke also saw the friendly atmosphere as an opportunity to once again cast doubt on the latest federal climate assessment. The 1600 page report was issued by 13 federal agencies including Interior and released on Black Friday the day after Thanksgiving a move that many saw as an administrative attempt to bury the findings. Like so many other climate reports before it the assessment warns that greenhouse gas emissions have put the planet on a path toward catastrophic climate change. But instead of blasting the reports authors there are more than 300 for basing their findings on the most extreme scenarios a false claim that he and the White House pushed last week Zinke on Tuesday blamed the media among other targets. The media focused on worst case scenarios which statistically we may not even be able to reach he said. The facts of the matter is observable data climate change is more toward the peace time he added comparing the document to international relations. Its kind of like the military he said. Theres peace time and theres global nuclear combat. The media focused on global nuclear combat. A lot of the millennials look at that report and they dont look at the models instead focusing on rising sea levels that statistically and data wise we dont know he said. Zinke boasted to the room full of oil executives who have been primary beneficiaries of the Trump administrations denial of climate science and energy dominance agenda that the U.S. has led the charge in reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. His concern as the leader of the federal agency he said is that we need to be better at emphasizing the case for American energy.	False	False	False	True	True
In an interview on MSNBC on Thursday former Secretary of State John Kerry said President Donald Trumps decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord puts America last is shameful and will hurt kids by worsening their asthma. It is a shameful moment for the United States to have unilaterally walked away from an agreement which did not have one other country requiring us to do something Kerry told Andrea Mitchell. It was a voluntary program The president was not truthful with the American people today and the president who talked about putting America first has now put America last. Kerry claimed Trump is not helping the forgotten American. Trump is not helping the forgotten American Kerry said. He is hurting them. Their kids will have worse asthma in the summer. They will have a harder time having economic growth. Hes made us an environmental pariah in the world and I think it is one of the most self destructive moves Ive ever seen by any president in my lifetime. Kerrys primary arguments that Trumps decision will hurt kids with asthma and damage the economy were incredibly misleading. A 2015 study by researcher Dr. Corrine Keet at Johns Hopkins Children Center found no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of asthma for kids living in inner city areas where there is much more air pollution and kids who live in the suburbs and rural areas. More than 23000 children were included in the study. Daniel Simmons the vice president for policy at the Institute for Energy Research noted in a quote appearing in an article by EE News that asthma rates have been steadily worsening even though air quality has been improving. Air quality has been increasing pollution has been decreasing things are getting better and asthmas getting worse Simmons said. You have this disconnect. In 2013 USA Today reported that Earths warming climate has caused pollen season to increase thereby exacerbating many peoples asthma. If climate change is being caused by human produced carbon dioxide this could lend support to Kerrys claim about asthma. Of course scientists disagree over what has caused Earths climate to warm over the past century and perhaps most importantly increased pollen comesfrom increased plant growth and as a result increased crop yields. Should more plants and food for people and animals really be demonized? Kerrys argument that Trumps decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement will cause economic problems is equally absurd. Kerry cited in the interview the millions of renewable energy jobs that have been created to help curb carbon dioxide emissions as an example of how the Paris Agreement and its associated efforts would have a positive impact on the economy but the truth is that the only reason the wind and solar energy industries have been able to survive is because they are heavily subsidized by taxpayers. Further wind and solar are much more expensive forms of energy which means Americans power bills would continue to rise under the terms of the Paris Climate Agreement. As H. Sterling Burnett a research fellow in climate and energy issues for The Heartland Institute where I also work as executive editor and a research fellow noted in a recent article on Trumps decision Numerous studies including a NERA Economic Consulting report cited in Trumps announcement showed meeting the carbon dioxide targets imposed on the United States under the Paris agreement would force the premature closing of many of the nations least expensive power plants. NERA estimated meeting the nations obligations under the agreement would cost the U.S. economy nearly 3 trillion and by 2040 the United States would have lost 6.5 million industrial sector jobs including 3.1 million manufacturing jobs.

Antarctica Has Lost More Than 3 Trillion Tons Of Ice In 25 Years Scientists have completed the most exhaustive assessment of changes in Antarctica's ice sheet to date. And they found that it's melting faster than they thought. Ice losses totaling 3 trillion tonnes or more than 3.3 trillion tons since 1992 have caused global sea levels to rise by 7.6 mm nearly one third of an inch according to a study published in Nature on Wednesday. Before 2010 Antarctica was contributing a relatively small proportion of the melting that is causing global sea levels to rise says study co leader Andrew Shepherd of the University of Leeds. But that has changed. Since around 2010 2012 we can see that there's been a sharp increase in the rate of ice loss from Antarctica. And the ice sheet is now losing three times as much ice Shepherd adds. The annual sea level rise that's attributed to Antarctica has tripled from 0.2mm to 0.6mm he says. That's a big jump and it did catch us all by surprise Shepherd says. The melting is caused by rising ocean temperatures due to climate change. Shepherd says they've seen the most dramatic effects in West Antarctica where the ice sheet rests on the sea bed. When we look into the ocean we find that it's too warm and the ice sheet can't withstand the temperatures that are surrounding it in the sea he says. That's causing glaciers to flow more quickly into the sea. East Antarctica which is home to the South Pole has seen considerably less melting because most of its ice is above sea level. That's an important distinction because it means it's insulated from changes in the ocean's temperature. This assessment conducted by 84 scientists from 44 international organizations is known as the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter comparison Exercise IMBIE. There have been many other estimates of how much ice has melted in Antarctica. And many of those papers showed different results. Some of the estimates covered different proportions of the ice sheets some of them covered different time periods and all of them used different methods and so it became difficult for people who are not specialists to try to pick them apart says Shepherd. So that was the motivation for originally setting up the project. The scientists combined 24 different satellite surveys which Shepherd says provides a more complete picture of the overall ice sheet change than previous studies. We believe that we've captured all of the different satellite records that exist on the planet he says. To analyze the ice the researchers use three different kinds of measurements. Satellite altimeters measure the height of the ice sheets to see how much they are thinning or thickening over time. Another measurement records the speed of the glaciers and how they're moving into the ocean. Finally the scientists are recording gravity measurements for Antarctica. These tell us about changes in the earth's gravitational attraction over time and that can be related to the mass of the ice sheets overall Shepherd says and they are really powerful measurements because they can add up everything across Antarctica. So what accounts for the apparent three fold speed up in Antarctica's melting in the last five years? Shepherd says that actually their data shows a a progressive increase in ice loss throughout the whole 25 year time period. However a period of heavy snowfall between 2005 and 2010 masked some of the immediate effects of the ice loss accounting for the sudden steep increase in more recent years. This new data creates a much starker picture of the future than previous estimates. Shepherd says until 2010 the data had been tracking a lower scenario which estimated that Antarctica wouldn't make much of a contribution to sea level rise at all because of the effects of higher snowfall. However he says that now the data is tracking a higher scenario which could mean nearly 6 inches of additional sea level rise in the next century. That could be a big deal he says for anybody who lives works and governs a coastal region. Understanding the rate of Antarctica's melting is crucial for these communities. If all of the ice in Antarctica melted global sea levels would rise by more than 190 feet.	True	True	False	True	False
Most also say that water is the most important issue to them in that category. According to the poll which has a 3.4 margin of error 67 of Democrats 54 of independents and 33 of Republicans believe that Democrat Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom and Republican businessman John Coxs views on environmental issues will impact how they vote. So far Newsom holds a 24 point lead over Cox who beat former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigos in the June primary to proceed to the November general election. Meanwhile the PPIC poll also found that likely voters see drought and water supply as the top environmental issue facing the state followed by air pollution a majority 58 support a water bond on the November ballot and noted that astrong majority of likely voters 69 say that the effects of global warming have already begun. In an interview with the Flash Report this week Cox said water housing affordability and the gas tax are the three main issues he wants to tackle. He reportedly blamed out of touch elites for the Golden States water issues and called Newsom the poster boy for these problems. Environmental issues have been a strong point for Newsom who last year said hewould use specific environmental laws in California to stop President Donald Trumps border wall from being built. For all the talk about the importance of environmental issues to voters in the deep blue state of California the topic does not seem to do well for media outlets even left wing ones. Chris Hayes of MSNBC recentlysaid networks mostly try to avoid discussing environmental issues related to the topic of climate change because almost without exception. every single time weve covered its been a palpable ratings killer. so the incentives are not great.

The White House on Tuesday denied that it is currently considering two controversial provisions to raise revenue as part of its broad tax overhaul. Earlier in the day The Washington Post reported that the Trump administration was looking at a value added tax or carbon tax as part of its reform plan. However the newspaper stressed administration officials say the plan is not finalized and the Trump administration continues to mull alternatives. As we have said many times the President's team is hearing input from experts on all sides of the tax reform debate as we formulate what will ultimately be the President's plan to enact the first significant tax reform since 1986. As of now neither a carbon tax nor a VAT are under consideration a White House spokeswoman said in a statement. Republicans have turned their attention to an overhaul of the U.S. tax system a key campaign goal after their first attempt to replace the Affordable Care Act failed. Opposition to border adjustment a House GOP provision designed to raise revenue and help to offset major tax cuts threatens to delay or trip up efforts to pass reform. A value added tax which is widely used around the world is consumption based. A carbon tax would hit emissions of greenhouse gases related to the burning of fossil fuels. The carbon tax would appear to clash with the priorities Trump has sought so far in his administration. He has taken steps to start rolling back environmental regulations on coal companies. The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request to comment. Watch White House says no to VAT carbon tax	True	False	False	True	True
Instead the city will look for energy from renewable sources including wind and solar he decided. This is the Green New Deal Not in concept not in the future but now Garcetti said as quoted by theLos Angeles Times. He made the decision despite the fact that top staffers have argued in recent months that the gas plants are critical to keeping the lights on in the city theTimes noted. The term Green New Deal refers to a bill introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D NY last week which proposes moving the entire U.S. economy to renewable energy in the next ten years. The plan also aims to provide every American with a guaranteed job with a family sustaining wage adequate family and medical leave paid vacations and retirement security to all people. The bill does not explain how those benefits will be paid for nor how the renewable energy goals will be achieved given that renewables currently provide less than 20 of the countrys energy. Environmentalists are also opposed to using one of those renewable sources hydroelectric power because of concerns about environmental damage caused by dams. California has a law already in place mandating a shift to 100 renewable sources but by 2045 not 2030. It is not clear how the state will achieve that goal. In his comments Garcetti slammed natural gas as an energy source Now is the time to start the beginning of the end of natural gas. Ironically the switch from coal to natural gas over the past decade has enabled the U.S. economy to grow while reducing emissionsover the long run. More gas for electricity has been our most effective weapon at combating climate change wrote RealClearEnergy editor Jude Clemente last year. Garcetti pledged to replace L.A.s natural gas plants with wind and solar energy but offered no plans describing how the city would do so nor whether it would be able to meet the energy needs of an expanding city. Southern California already struggles to provide electricity to consumers during heat waves when air conditioning use is at a maximum and prices soar. In addition utilities have begun shutting down power lines during high winds for fear of starting wildfires. During a natural gas leak in Porter Ranch in 2016 L.A. authorities worried that the temporary closure of one natural gas plant could lead to power outages. Nevertheless Eric Garcetti was bullish on a future without fossil fuels even without a plan to replace them. The mayor said he had challenged the citys Department of Water and Power to come up with an answer Instead of saying all the reasons why not get to a reason as to why. Garcetti will leave office in 2022. The first of the three plants to be replaced will be retired in 2024. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor at Large at Breitbart News.

NEW YORK Over the past two yearscorporate giants have become some of the loudest voices calling for climate change action. Automakers that once killed the electric car are racing to roll outzero emissions rivals to Tesla. Even Exxon Mobil Corp. the oil behemoth that spent decades bankrolling a Big Tobacco style campaign to discredit global warming has named a climate scientist to its board. The site fits comfortably into Bloombergs stable of products anchored by its lucrative data terminal business. In December 2015 just before 195 countries reached the historic emissions cutting deal known as the Paris Agreement Bloomberg published its Carbon Clock featuring a carbon dioxide tracker overlaid on satellite images of the Earth. The company owns Bloomberg New Energy Finance a data firm dedicated to the energy industry. Michael Bloomberg who returned to his namesake company after his third term as New York City mayor is an outspoken climate advocate who this week published a book with former Sierra Club chief Carl Pope on how cities and businesses can lead energy reform. For the launch the site will include a feature on how communities in South Florida are coping with rising waters a short animated video series on heat extreme weather and the cost of carbon and a multi part graphic on Russias growing influence in the fast warming Arctic. Climate Changed gives Bloomberg a leg up on The Wall Street Journal arguably its chief competitor in the market for prestige journalism. The Rupert Murdoch owned newspapers hard line conservativismappears to have bled over from the opinion pages to the news section. A study published in 2015 by researchers at Rutgers University the University of Michigan and the University of Oslo found that from 2006 to 2011 the Journals news reporting rarely mentionedthreats or effects of climate change compared with the countrys other leading broadsheet newspapers. But the new Bloomberg site isnt looking to make a political splash necessarily.Sure President Donald Trump has dismissed climate change as a Chinese hoax and has made gutting environmental policies a cornerstone of his agenda since entering the White House. And yes his budget director called efforts to mitigate or halt climate change a waste of your money. But at Bloomberg raw hard data trumps political rhetoric and the editors there dont buy the billionaire presidents bombast. There is a difference between Trump the politician and Trump the investor Jared Sandberg senior executive editor in Bloombergs digital division told HuffPost. Trump is already building a wall around his seaside Irish golf resort Sandberg noted a sign the risk of rising sea levels is too high to ignore. Its the mother of all risk Sandberg added. If you have intelligence agencies around the world identifying climate change as one of the great destabilizing forces theres a massive risk to contend with for any business and any investor behind it. Climate Changed wont be focused on debunking fringe voices the sort that might show on the pages of the far right news site Breitbart who seek to undermine climate science by depicting it as some kind of conspiracy. Comparing what people say to data then stepping out of the room is sort of the best thing journalists can do Roston said. We dont have a social mission other than transparency and fact checking. Throughout the economy fossil fuels being only the most obvious example new information has come to light that challenges whether historic price levels of these things are appropriate given what weve learned about their impact on society Roston said. He admitted in a media environment that rewards sensationalism and factual manipulation the approach may seem a bit bland. Were not going to win the internet by going out and saying everybody is doing it wrong its just a pricing story. But from a Bloomberg perspective its helpful for me to think of in terms of repricing events. The site has yet to lock down advertisers to sponsor the launch. But it shouldnt have much trouble finding bidders. Nearly every company in the SP 500 now issues regular reports on sustainability efforts. The business community absolutely demands this the investor community demands this Sandberg said. You dont go through the quarterly quarterly results from Coke Levis or anyone else and not come away thinking that they dont have concerns over limited resources like water. The question isnt why now its why havent we all agreed to do this sooner Sandberg added. Weve always had this kind of coverage but I think its high time we do something better to admire it organize it and make it easier for people to discover.	True	True	False	True	True
Rose Strauss apparently isnt showing favoritism in the race for Pennsylvania governor at least when it comes to asking candidates about climate change. The 18 year old activist made a name for herself beyond the Keystone State last month when she questioned Republican gubernatorial nominee Scott Wagner at a town hall on what she said was his lack of action on climate change and donations he received from the fossil fuel industry. And why did Strauss win the internet that day? Well in a way she has Wagner to thank for that as he responded by calling Strauss a little young and naive on video which subsequently went viral. Wagner also asked the Glenside crowd Are we here to elect a governor or are we here to elect a scientist? Wagner in 2017 said climate change is likely occurring but perhaps because we have more people. You know humans have warm bodies. So is heat coming off? And his campaign has received163750 from the oil and gas industry according to Vote Smart a nonprofit political watch dog organization the York Dispatch said. John Fetterman the running mate for Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf ripped Wagner on Twitter over his comments toward Strauss. He also used a Young and Naive slogan for 25 T shirts the York Daily Record reported while Wolfs campaign announced free limited edition stickers using the phrase It turns out all the T shirts and stickers in the world immortalizing Wagners words to her could not impede Strauss from turning her confrontation Wolfs way as she and activists tried to intercept the governor as he walked into an event last week the Daily Record said. Tom Wolf! Its Rose Strauss! Its Rose Strauss Tom Wolf! shes heard shouting on video. Im the girl whos young and naive! Strauss then yelled a question at Wolf about the funds his campaign got from the fossil fuel industry 98000 during the 2018 election cycle according to Follow the Money. Strauss said Sunrise Movement Downingtown has twice reached out to Joseph Hill Wolfs deputy campaign manager and political director to request a meeting but has yet to receive a response the Daily Record reported. He has shown support for the young and naive voters Strauss told the paper adding that while Wolf has supported us verbally the governor hasnt committed to action on things we care about like climate change. Wolfs campaign declined to say if hell meet with Strauss and other activists but offered the following statement to the Daily Record Governor Wolf is committed to protecting and preserving the environment. One of his first acts as governor was to sign an executive order reinstating the moratorium on new leases for drilling in state parks and forests and he has been fighting efforts by Republicans in Washington to cut EPA funding. Governor Wolf worked across party lines with the state legislature which is heavily Republican to pass the Chapter 78a Environmental Protection Performance Standards. This bipartisan agreement modernizes and strengthens environmental protections at oil and gas sites in Pennsylvania. He also announced a nation leading strategy to reduce emissions of methane. Governor Wolf has met with environmentalists throughout the state to discuss ways they could work together to combat climate change and strengthen statewide regulations to ensure the protection of public health safety and the environment. He will continue to engage the environmental community throughout the commonwealth to ensure that their voices are heard. Scott is having town halls to articulate his positions on the issues to people of all demographics and backgrounds Wagner campaign spokesman Andrew Romeo told TheBlaze on Wednesday. And while some might disagree with him on a policy approach to an issue which is what happened at the Montgomery County Town Hall he will continue to hold similar events for the remainder of the campaign. If voters want to know Scotts position on an issue they wont have to ambush him outside an event just to get a hold of him they can come ask him their questions in person. He certainly wont bury his head and keep walking. Wagner has since clarified his young and naive comment noting in a Sunday town hall that he didnt believe it was mean and that Im 62 years old and the young lady asking the question was 18. I have a little more experience than she does the Daily Record reported. And that wasnt meant to insult her in any way.	True	False	True	True	False
As levels of greenhouse gases reach a new record concerns are growing about the role of China in global warming. For years the increase in the number of Chinese coal fired power stations has been criticised. Now environmental groups say China is also backing dozens of coal projects far beyond its borders. Coal is the most damaging of the fossil fuels because of the quantity of carbon dioxide it releases when it's burned. Last year the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached its highest level for the past 3 5 million years according to the latest research by the UN's weather agency the World Meteorological Organisation WMO. And last month the UN's climate science panel said that coal must be phased out by 2050 if the world is to have any chance of limiting the rise in temperatures. The Chinese supported coal projects are under way or planned as far afield as South America Africa southeast Asia and the Balkans. Contracts and financing for these facilities are often not fully transparent but campaign groups including Bankwatch have tried to keep track. You cannot be a world leader in curbing air pollution and at the same time the world's biggest financier of overseas coal power plants the group's energy coordinator Ioana Ciuta told the BBC. According to Ms Ciuta efforts to tackle the dirty air of Chinese cities have led many power companies to limit their ambitions for coal fired power stations in China itself and to target their technology and labour overseas instead. By having China invest in over 60 countries along the Belt and Road Initiative it's perpetuating a source of pollution that has been demonstrated to be harmful not just to the climate but also to economies she said. In Serbia one of the country's largest coal fired power stations is being expanded with the help of a loan from a Chinese bank and with the work being led by one of China's largest construction companies. An hour's drive east of the capital Belgrade in the coal rich Danube valley construction has already started at the site known as Kostolac B3. An existing power station towers over the rolling landscape a steady stream of pollution twisting from a massive smokestack and conveyor belts ferry coal from a nearby open cast mine at Drmno. The power station is run by the national Serbian electricity company EPS which provides about 70 of the country's power by burning coal the rest comes from hydro electric schemes. Now under a 715m 560m contract agreed by the Serbian government and Chinese President Xi Jinping an extra unit is being added which will bring 350MW of additional capacity with the latest super critical technology. When we visit we catch a brief glimpse of a group of Chinese workers wearing hard hats on their way from the construction site to a vast set of accommodation blocks by next year some 1500 Chinese staff will be here. Safety signs and notice boards are written in Serbian and Chinese. Equipment and shipping containers carry Chinese labels. I ask the EPS official running the project Zeljko Lazovic what he feels about such a large and important venture being in the hands of Chinese engineers and workers. In the next few months a lot of Chinese will come here and this will be a big challenge he says. With Chinese workers and Serbian workers at the beginning we had some cultural problems but we have overcome them and there is now very good cooperation. When asked about the environmental cost of the new project Mr Lazovic insisted it would meet all the EU's standards on pollution by dust nitrogen dioxide and sulphur. However the new unit will not be fitted with any carbon capture technology so it will fit into a pattern of Chinese backed projects that will add to carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Christine Shearer is an analyst with the group CoalSwarm which tracks coal developments and she is scathing about the implications. These projects are not compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C or 2C she said referring to the two targets of the Paris Agreement on climate change. She says that Chinese financial institutions are filling a gap left by Western banks and agencies deciding to limit their involvement in coal. These projects if completed will lock the countries into high carbon emitting infrastructure and volatile coal imports precisely at a time when prices for clean energy are starting to fall below that of coal power. We tried to contact the Export Import Bank of China which is providing the loan and the China Machinery Engineering Corporation which is leading the construction but did not hear back. For the Serbian power company EPS the attraction of a local supply of coal has combined with a cheap Chinese loan and the prospects of valuable exports of electricity. About 3500 jobs depend on the Kostolac complex but some local people have become increasingly outspoken about the pollution in the area. Momir Savic showed me how the conveyor belts carrying coal run close to the villages and he fears a further expansion of the operation. The quality of our air and water is very poor. We cannot grow fruit and vegetables. There is also a lot of noise. All this affects the health of people living here many of whom have respiratory diseases he said. EPS says it is spending hundreds of millions of euros on environmental protection but its track record clearly does not inspire trust. Pera Markovic a lawyer with Cekor an environmental group is critical of the company's failure to limit pollution in the local area. But he concedes that Serbia is heavily dependent on coal for its power. For how long? Decades Mr Markovic says. That's likely to be the same in many other countries too whatever climate scientists say is needed.	False	False	False	True	True
Energy Secretary Rick Perry veering from the Trump administration message on climate change told CNBC on Wednesday he believes that human activity does play a role. I'm on the record as saying the climate is changing. Man it's been changing forever. Where have you been? Perry said in a Squawk Box interview when pressed on what causes climate change. The climate is changing. Are we part of the reason? Yeah it is. I'll let people debate on who's the bigger problem here. Perry did not quantify whether man made greenhouse gases associated with climate change such as carbon dioxide emissions from burning gasoline and coal or methane releases from natural gas and oil production are the main problem or even whether they're causing the immediate and growing crisis that Democrats contend. However Perry did say that it's still worth developing zero emissions technology and that the Trump administration has made great strides in cleaner energy solutions. We're going to address the climate. It makes sense for us to have policies that reduce emissions that reduce the pollutants that are in the air to reduce the particles that cause massive health problems around the world he said. Common sense tells you bring the cleaner burning fuels bring the things that bring the emissions down. That's just common sense. Perry said the administration is reducing emissions claiming without evidence or specificity that countries in the Paris climate agreement with their hair on fire when President Donald Trump announced his intention to pull out two years ago are not doing as much as the U.S. Trump has repeatedly over the years expressed skepticism about the role humans play in climate change. In 2017 then Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt told CNBC he does not believe carbon dioxide is a primary contributor. On Monday Trump talked about his administration's environmental record saying America can lead the world in fighting pollution at the same time it promotes fossil fuels. Since taking office Trump has dismantled scores of environmental rules. The U.S. has become the world's biggest oil and gas producer over the last couple of years thanks mainly to a technology led drilling boom. During the first round of the second Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday evening the 2020 hopefuls on the stage all agreed on the need to urgently address climate change but clashed over how to do it. They also talked about their own proposals to curb what they see as the man made causes as well as the merits of the Green New Deal unveiled in February by Democrats New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez and Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey.	True	False	False	True	True
Advocates of man made climate change believe that it causes strong storms rising tides and hot temperatures and that black communities are disproportionately hurt by the effects of global warming. That was the topic at a recent roundtable discussion in Washington DC where Bloomberg Environment reported that activists at the event said Congress needed to take action. People of color have always been on the front line of this movement Alaina Beverly a former Obama White House urban affairs official who is now vice president for urban affairs at the University of Chicagos Office of Federal Relations in Washington said at the event. Were hit first and hit worst. This is our issue Beverly said. Bloomberg Environment reported on how blacks are allegedly suffering from climate change related hardships Most of the worst effects of climate change are hittingand lingering inpoor black neighborhoods in the South according to the Rev. Leo Woodberry executive director of the New Alpha Community Development Corporation in Florence S.C. In coastal South Carolina for example residents in largely black towns have been told they wont be eligible for flood insurance if they dont elevate their homes but a survey of local engineering groups showed the cost starts at 20000 for a 900 square foot house Woodberry said. In New York City many residents who die from heat stroke are African American Peggy Shepard executive director of West Harlem Environmental Action Inc. also known as WE ACT for Environmental Justice said at a Sept. 12 roundtable hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation where Beverly and Woodberry also spoke. This is about social disruption Shepard said. Extreme heat is killing thousands every year. Bloomberg Environment cited a University of California at Berkeley study that said blacks are 52 percent more likely than whites to live in so called urban heat islands where the sun beams down on brick concrete and asphalt. Theres no question that this is a topic area that black politicians including the CBC Congressional Black Caucus have not focused on as much Thomas A. LaVeist dean of Tulane Universitys School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine said in an interview. And I think its because the stereotype is that the environment is about tree hugging or saving exotic birds. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus say theyve heard the call and are working on solutions Bloomberg Environment reported. The caucus is made up of 55 African American members of the House and Senate. I think were going to be energetic in supporting any legislation that is aimed at improving the environment but I also have to tell you how congested the major issues have become Rep. Emanuel Cleaver D MO said in the Bloomberg Environment article. Cleaver said lawmakers could add language to the Federal Emergency Management Agencys FEMA budget to put resources in poor black communities and the National Flood Insurance Program could add more protections for black communities. Bloomberg Environment reported that some are already putting out legislation with this goal in mind including Reps. Maxine Waters D CA Raul Grijalva D AZ and A. Donald McEachin D VA. For African Americans and people living in urban poor communities it provides them with an empowerment tool to enforce the law to demand action and to try to get remediation done Grijalva told Bloomberg Environment. Separately Rep. Kathy Castor D Fla. chairwoman of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis is working on a climate bill to be rolled out in March that among other things will aim to help communities of color living near pollution sources Bloomberg Environment reported. Many House Democrats think theres value in putting these measures up for a vote even if they have little chance in the Senate now to send a message. The article also quoted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D NY about her Green New Deal resolution that puts social justice even above climate change. I think its backwards and shortsighted to say Well lets just throw a bunch of solar panels on everyones roof and call it a day Ocasio Cortez said. Because you cannot build a winning political coalition to fight climate change on just technocratic solutions. By fighting for the actual justice and livelihood of working people you are going to create the political energy to actually address climate change she said.	False	False	False	False	False
The president of an island nation on the frontline of climate change says it is in a fight to the death after freak waves inundated the capital. Powerful swells averaging 5m 16ft washed across the capital of the Marshall Islands Majuro last week. But President Hilda Heine said the Pacific nation had been fighting rising tides even before last week's disaster. Political leaders and climate diplomats are meeting in Madrid for two weeks of talks amid a growing sense of crisis. This conference of the parties or COP25 was due to be held in Chile but was cancelled by the government due to weeks of civil disturbances. Spain then stepped in to host the event which will see 29000 attendees over the two weeks of talks. Climate change Where we are in seven charts The world's average surface temperature is rising rapidly because human activities release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide CO2. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere a bit like the glass roof of a greenhouse. At the meeting Ms Heine commented Water covers much of our land at one or other point of the year as we fight rising tides. As we speak hundreds of people have evacuated their homes after large waves caused the ocean to inundate parts of our capital in Majuro last week. She added It's a fight to the death for anyone not prepared to flee. As a nation we refuse to flee. But we also refuse to die. Ms Heine is not alone in the view that small nations like the Marshall Islands face an imminent existential threat. At the Madrid summit ambassador Lois Young from the Alliance of Small Island States AOSIS which represents low lying coastal countries and small island nations launched a rebuke to the world's big polluters. We are disappointed by inadequate action by developed countries and outraged by the dithering and retreat of one of the most culpable polluters from the Paris Agreement she said. In the midst of a climate emergency retreat and inaction are tantamount to sanctioning ecocide. They reflect profound failure to honour collective global commitment to protect the most vulnerable. With our very existence at stake COP 25 must demonstrate unprecedented ambition to avert ecocide. The COP25 meeting will aim to step up ambition so that all countries increase their national commitments to cut emissions. The meeting follows on the heels of three UN reports which stressed the increased urgency of limiting dangerous climate change. According to UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres the point of no return is no longer over the horizon. Speaking ahead of the meeting he said political leaders had to respond to the imminent climate crisis. In the crucial 12 months ahead it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments particularly from the main emitters to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature based solutions Mr Guterres said. Almost every country in the world has now signed and ratified the Paris climate agreement and under the terms of the pact they will all have to put new climate pledges on the table before the end of 2020. This meeting in Madrid signals the start of a frantic 12 months of negotiations that will culminate in Glasgow with COP26 in November next year. Some 50 world leaders are expected to attend the meeting in the Spanish capital but US President Donald Trump will not be among them. The US became a signatory to the landmark Paris climate agreement in April 2016 under the Obama administration. But President Trump has said the accord which has been signed by more than 190 countries would lead to lost jobs and lower wages for American workers. Last month he began the process of withdrawing from the Paris deal. However Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi will attend the conference with a congressional delegation. While her presence has been welcomed US environmentalists want to see concrete steps on climate. While it's great Speaker Pelosi is coming to Madrid in place of Trump symbolic gestures are no substitute for bold action said Jean Su from the US Center for Biological Diversity. America remains the number one historic contributor to the climate emergency and even Democratic politicians have never committed to taking responsibility for our fair share. Underlining the real world impacts of climate change a report from the charity Save the Children says that what it calls climate shocks are threatening tens of millions of people in East and Southern Africa. The charity says 33 million people are at emergency levels of food insecurity due to cyclones and droughts. More than half of these are believed to be children. The situation has been made worse because the two strongest cyclones ever to hit the African continent affected the same region just weeks apart. Cyclone Idai struck Mozambique Zimbabwe and Malawi last March while six weeks later Cyclone Kenneth slammed Mozambique with millions affected by flooding. The climate crisis is happening here and it's killing people forcing them from their homes and ruining children's chance of a future said Ian Vale from Save the Children.	False	False	False	True	False
A Trump administration presentation extolling the virtues of fossil fuels at the UN climate talks in Poland has been met with guffaws of laughter and chants of Shame on you. Mondays protest came during a panel discussion by the official US delegation which used its only public appearance to promote the unapologetic utilisation of coal oil and gas. Although these industries are the main source of the carbon emissions that are causing global warming the speakers boasted the US would expand production for the sake of global energy security and planned a new fleet of coal plants with technology it hoped to export to other countries. The event featured prominent cheerleaders for fossil fuels and nuclear power including Wells Griffith Donald Trumps adviser on global energy and climate Steve Winberg the assistant secretary for fossil energy at the energy department and Rich Powell the executive director of the ClearPath Foundation a non profit organisation focused on conservative clean energy. The only non American was Patrick Suckling the ambassador for the environment in Australias coal enthusiast government. None of the US participants mentioned climate change or global warming focusing instead of innovation and entrepreneurship in the technological development of nuclear power clean coal and carbon capture and storage. Ten minutes into Griffiths opening speech he was interrupted by a sudden sustained loud volley of laughter by several dozen protesters that was then followed by a single shout of Its not funny and then a series of chants of Keep it in the ground and Shame on you. Several campaigners read statements. There is no such thing as clean coal. Coal is deadly from the beginning to the end. They talk about the life cycle of coal I talk about it as a death march. My father died of black lung and I am in this struggle with others whose fathers and husbands are dying of black lung right now said Teri Blanton of Kentuckians for the Commonwealth which represents Appalachian coal workers in North America. After the protesters were led away by security guards Griffiths said In the US our policy is not to keep it in the ground but to use it as cleanly and efficiently as possible. This statement was contradicted by climate analysts who noted the US environment agency estimates that 1400 more deaths per year will result from Trumps proposal to replace the Clean Power Act. Its ludicrous for Trump officials to claim that they want to clean up fossil fuels while dismantling standards that would do just that said Dan Lashof the director of the World Resources Institute. Since taking office this administration has proposed to roll back measures to cut methane leaks from oil and gas operations made it easier for companies to dump coal ash into drinking water and just days ago proposed easing carbon pollution rules for new coal fired power plants. Griffith boasted the US had the largest coal reserves in the world and iwas producing more petroleum than ever. To achieve economic growth and eradicate poverty all energy uses are important and they will be utilised unapologetically he said. Echoing a claim often made by Trump Griffiths said the US would not be subject to agreements that hamstrung domestic growth while allowing China to operate with high emissions. This was the second consecutive year that the Trump team was heckled after promoting fossil fuels and nuclear power at the climate talks underscoring how the US position has shifted since the president took power in 2017. The US was a key player in forging the Paris agreement in 2015 but its standing has steadily eroded since. In 2017 Trump announced he would pull the US out of the global accord. This year his representatives have taken a still more destructive stance by aligning with Russia Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to try to downgrade a key report by the worlds scientists that warned of the dangers of global warming moving beyond 1.5C above pre industrial levels. None of the panelists would be drawn on the study but Griffith spoke out against alarmism that he claimed displaced pragmatic solutions to address environmental concerns with prescriptive regulations that put jobs at risk and raised costs for consumers. In fact scientists say their forecasts about climate impacts have been too conservative while economists say the shift to renewables has resulted in cheaper energy for many users. Winberg said the US government was planning to support a new fleet of small modular coal plants that he claimed would be energy efficient and have near zero emissions if combined with carbon capture technology. After initial development in the US he said they could be exported to other countries. They offer opportunity for developing nations to access tomorrows coal technology to improve energy security he said. He also proposed more pipelines to oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite this public commitment the US use of coal is declining because renewables are cheaper according to Nathaniel Keohane the senior vice president for the Environmental Defense Fund nonprofit group. Trump is playing politics but its not changing the facts on the ground he said. Coal usage in the US just hit a 39 year low. If we really want to protect our economy well move aggressively toward 100 clean energy. An alternative non official US delegation has backed a faster transition to renewables. Made up of city and state level governments business executives and religious leaders the Were still in group is staging dozens of events in a bid to show action is still possible without White House support. Nonetheless many observers at the official US panel were ashamed at the position of their federal government. I was completely embarrassed to be an American said Leo McNeil Woodberry of the Climate Action Network. Everything they proposed was absolutely wrong. I cant believe they are putting profits over the planet and profits over people.	True	False	False	False	True
President Donald Trump picked West Virginia to announce his plan to reduce pollution controls on coal fired power plants which is no surprise. West Virginia loves coal and coal miners love Trump but what both of them may not love is the fact that a reduction in pollution controls is going to greatly increase the number of people who die prematurely from pollution created by burning coal. It will also greatly increase the number of people who get sick with serious illnesses such as heart and lung problems. When he made his announcement somehow Trump left out those details of the life threatening side effects of using coal to create electrical energy. Even though they will be getting sick and dying at higher rates it is not expected that Trumps actions will reduce his popularity among West Virginians. An analysis done by his own Environmental Protection Agency EPA concludes that the rollback of Obama era pollution controls will lead to many more people dying and suffering health problems that they otherwise would not have. Clean air controls since the 1980s stopped the columns of black soot that used to rise from coal smokestacks in the region. The clean air rules reduced the number of people dying from coal fired power plants substantially. Technology has changed and now pollutants rise from smokestacks as gases before solidifying into invisible particles small enough to pass through lungs and into bloodstreams. An EPA analysis says those pollutants would increase under Trumps plan when compared to what would happen under the Obama rules. This will result in many thousands of more heart attacks asthma problems and other illnesses than would have happened without Trumps new rules. The EPA says up to 1500 more people will die each year under Trumps plan. And the areas that will be hit the hardest are in Trump country the coal mining regions of West Virginia. There could be dozens of new deaths and hundreds of new serious illnesses each year because of Trumps plan. Obamas Clean Power Plan targeted climate changing carbon dioxide and would have curbed harmful emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants from the coal fired power plants. It would have increased federal regulation of emissions from the nations electrical grid and broadly promoted natural gas solar power and other cleaner energy. Trumps Affordable Clean Energy program will dismantle President Barack Obamas 2015 Clean Power Plan which has not yet been implemented due to court battles. Trumps plan will give up much of the federal oversight of existing coal fired power plants. Not only that but the government will no longer promote cleaner energy. Individual states will decide how much to regulate coal power plants in their own states. At his public announcement Trump said Im getting rid of some of these ridiculous rules and regulations which are killing our companies and our jobs. There was no mention of the increases in harmful emissions that would result compared to the Obama plan or the health risks. In West Virginia coal is popular and politicians who support coal get elected. Vivian Stockman of the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition was protesting outside Trumps rally. Our state is beholden to coal. Our politicians are beholden to coal. Meanwhile our people are being poisoned she said.	False	False	False	False	False
New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez on Monday unveilednew details on the so called Green New Deal she plans to introduce in a matter of days as she worked behind the scenes to rally congressional support for the proposal that could cost as much as 7 trillion. Ocasio Cortez who is set to unveil the plan with Massachusetts Democratic Sen.Ed Markey told her fellow representatives in a letter that the Green New Deal calls for anational social industrial and economic mobilization at a scale not seen since World War II. Next week we plan to release a resolution that outlines the scope and scale of the Green New Deal Ocasio Cortez said in the letter adding that the country's near totaleconomic transformationshould take approximately ten years. To raise awareness for the measureMarkey announced Monday he had invitedVarshini Prakash the co founder of the Sunrise Movement environmentalist group to be his guest at President Trump's State of the Union address Tuesday night. Several other Democrats announced guests apparently intended to highlight their opposition to various Trump administration policies while Trump himself extended invites to the family of a couple allegedly murdered by an illegal immigrantand a child bullied at school for having the last name Trump. The Green New Deal proposal would lead to national net zero greenhouse gas emissions according to Ocasio Cortez'sletter through a fair and just transition for all communities and workers while also generating millions of good high wage jobs. Details of the letter were first published by Bloomberg. ANALYSIS GREEN NEW DEAL IS MOST RADICAL LEGISLATION IN DECADES Through it all the Green New Deal would additionally promote justice and equity by preventing current and repairing historic oppression to frontline and vulnerable communities according to Ocasio Cortez. On Twitter Monday Ocasio Cortez reposted a claim from one of her advisersRobert Hockett arguing that in this case size matters and that the problems the Green New Deal addresses require solutions where bigger is better imperative and paraodixcally more affordable. Hockett is a lawyer and law professor and is not an expert in environmental policy. Severalanalysts meanwhile have cautioned that the liberal firebrand is in over her head even though the as yet vague and uncertain details about the Green New Deal render a precise calculation impossible at the moment. Physicist Christopher Clack told The Hillthat the cost would easily be into the trillions. Its a daunting task and Im not sure that the authors of the Green New Deal fully comprehend how much theyll need Clack said. Institute for Energy Research president Tom Pyle was more blunt One hundred percent renewable energy defies the laws of physics. It would be impossible to achieve. And Paul Bledsoe a strategic adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute said progressives were overcompensating. I understand the value of aspirational goals Bledsoesaid. My personal view is that undermines the credibility of the effort. Nevertheless approximately 70 Democraticlawmakers have so far tentativelyendorsed aGreen New Deal plan including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris. House speaker Nancy Pelosi who has vowed to address climate change has not publicly signed onto the plan even though scores of progressive activists joined by Ocasio Cortez staged a sit in at her House office late last year demanding action on the climate. While there is no legislative text yet available for the MarkeyOcasio Cortez proposal adraft circulated by Ocasio Cortez last weekcalled for a committee to be formed to create a plan and lays out a framework that includes eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture whiledramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources. To coverwhat would presumably be a gargantuan cost it envisions financing by the federal government using a combination of the Federal Reserve a new public bank or system of regional and specialized public banks public venture funds and such other vehicles or structures that the select committee deems appropriate in order to ensure that interest and other investment returns generated from public investments made in connection with the plan will be returned to the treasury reduce taxpayer burden and allow for more investment. As it stands any such proposal would be almost certainly dead on arrival in the Republican controlled Senate and also possibly the House where it is not clear if a majority of Democrats would back a plan. Even if Congress managed to pass a version of the Green New Deal the White House could veto the legislation anda two thirds majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate would be needed to override the veto. The Trump administrationhas made clear it would not accept Ocasio Cortez's proposals. In January White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders derided Ocasio Cortez'srecent claim that theworld will end in 12 yearsdue to climate change andsuggested the Trump administration has little need for the progressive firebrand'sthoughts in general. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP I don't think we'regoing to listen to Ocasio Cortez on much of anything particularly not on matters we're gonna leave in the hands of a much much higher authority and certainly not listen to the freshman congresswoman on when the world may end Sanders told Fox News' Hannity. Speaking at an eventcommemoratingMartin Luther King Day that monthOcasio Cortez asserted thatclimate change constituted our World War II and added Millennials and people you know Gen Z and all these folks that will come after us are looking up and were like The world is gonna end in 12 years if we dont address climate change and your biggest issue is how are we gonna pay for it?'

The Trump administration is challenging California over the state's new automotive emissions and fuel economy framework agreement with automakers insisting setting such standards is the federal government's role. Lawyers at the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Transportation on Friday sent a letter to the chairman of the California Air Resources Board following California's July framework agreement with Ford Volkswagen Honda and BMW to abide by certain new greenhouse gas emissions standards. The purpose of this letter is to put California on notice that this framework agreement appears to be inconsistent with federal law the letter said. Congress has squarely vested the authority to set fuel economy standards for new motor vehicles and nationwide standards for GHG vehicle emissions with the federal government not with California or any other state. Given the importance Congress placed on the authority of DOT and EPA for motor vehicle fuel economy and nationwide vehicle emissions standards under federal law we urge you to act immediately to disassociate CARB from the commitments made by the four automakers the letter added. California had imposed stricter fuel economy and emissions standards long before July and some of the state's laws were enacted before the Clean Air Act. Congress granted a waiver to allow California to enact its own standards and a dozen other states also adopted California's standards. The varied standards mean automakers have had to make extra effort in either making two types of cars or manufacturing them all in accordance with the higher California standards. President Trump has pushed for months to weaken Obama era mileage standards nationwide. Those standards were designed to make cars more fuel efficient and reduce pollution. The administration moves to rescind California's authority are likely to prompt legal battles. When President George W. Bush challenged California's greenhouse gas emissions and mileage setting ability California fought it in the courts. The Obama administration subsequently dropped the Bush effort. The Trump administration has argued that the extra expense to comply with the emissions requirements will raise the price of new cars making them unaffordable and depriving buyers of new safety technology. Many experts including former EPA engineers have challenged the administration's safety assertion. Mr. Trump has long advocated for the auto industry and his administration has emphasized that environmental concerns cannot trump economic considerations. You know for too long there's been this conventional wisdom that you've got to choose between economic growth and environmental protection Energy Secretary Rick Perry said during a July speech on the environment that avoided any mention of climate change. That's a false choice and it's one that you've talked about Mr. President. It's always been this country and this country that leads just like you reminded people last Thursday the greatness of America the innovation of America. And the future of this world will rely greatly upon America and this administration.	True	True	True	True	True
Washington CNN President Donald Trump spent an hour Thursday talking about his commitment to economic growth and national stability as he announced the decision to back out of the Paris Climate Accord. After famously calling climate change a hoax during the campaign Trump has avoided the issue of increased man made greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on global temperatures. Asked Wednesday if Trump thinks human activity is contributing to climate change White House press secretary Sean Spicer responded Honestly I haven't asked him that. I can get back to you. Two White House officials avoided similar questions at a background briefing with reporters after Trump's speech Thursday. And EPA chief Scott Pruitt dodged the question in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper. This is not about whether climate change is occurring or not Pruitt said on The Lead. The pattern of the White House has been to turn away from the discussion of climate change without taking the step to argue directly that global warming isn't real. Instead there is an administration wide reluctance to avoid the topic altogether. In recent months Trump proposed cutting the Environmental Protection Agency budget by more than 30. EPA has challenged scientific findings on climate change including by its own in house scientists. And EPA cut climate information from its website. Former deputy EPA administrator under President Barack Obama Bob Perciasepe said the Trump administration's avoidance of the term just makes them seem out of touch with reality. Climate change is happening whether they speak about it or not said Perciasepe who currently serves as president of the nonprofit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. You can't make something not real if you just don't talk about it. It doesn't change reality it's just a way for them to de emphasize something the rest of the world knows is going on. On Wednesday the White House declared June National Oceans Month and Great Outdoors Month. While the proclamations a relatively standard annual designation praised the US's oceans and natural landscapes the language clearly differed from Obama's. Where Obama's 2016 proclamations discussed the impacts of global warming including drought and rising sea levels Trump's focused on energy production fisheries management and tourism with no mention of climate change. And the administration is adopting the same reasoning in press releases. Last month the Interior Department released a study by the U.S. Geological Survey that highlighted the link between sea level rise and global climate change. Except the release had one thing missing any mention of climate change. Three of the study's scientist authors told The Washington Post that they had to ultimately delete a line from the report that read Global climate change drives sea level rise increasing the frequency of coastal flooding. Instead the USGS release leaves the cause unmentioned . It begins The frequency and severity of coastal flooding throughout the world will increase rapidly and eventually double in frequency over the coming decades even with only moderate amounts of sea level rise. A defense against believing humans are responsible for climate change is that scientific studies are not 100 certain a stance frequently used by members of the Trump administration that muddles the scientific consensus that man made emissions are driving global warming. I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact Pruitt said in a CNBC interview in March . So no I would not agree that it's a primary contributor to the global warming that we see. While the White House may be against jumping to conclusions on the available scientific studies with Pruitt even calling for more data from industry scientists the administration has done little to back up those calls monetarily. In fact instead of spending money to further study the effects and reality or unreality of global warming the administration has opted instead to cut much of the major funding that would go towards the studies. It is hypocritical said Andrew Rosenberg director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. They are complaining about uncertainty but at the same time increasing uncertainty by cutting back on ways to measure climate change. For many the administration's reluctance to deal with the idea of climate change comes down to one thought that economic growth and climate awareness cannot go hand in hand. The idea that they are operating on is that the US will be at a disadvantage if it deals with climate change. Most businesses would think that working on the climate issues can and has been creating jobs said Perciasepe. It can strengthen United States company's competitiveness in the global markets.

President Trump on Wednesday signed two executive orders that will make it harder for states to block the construction of oil and gas pipelines and other energy projects due to environmental concerns. Coming on the heels of officials in Washington state and New York using permitting processes to stop new energy projects in recent years and at the urging of some industry leaders Trumps executive order willspeed up the construction of oil and gas pipelines across the country. My action today will cut through the destructive permitting and denials Trump said during the signing of the executive orders at the International Union of Operating Engineers International Training and Education Center a union run facility in Crosby Texas. Under this administration weve ended the war on American energy. It will take no more than 60 days Trump said of the approval process for new pipelines and the president not the bureaucracy will make the final decision. While the move was greeted warmly by members of the countrys oil and gas industries it is likely to rankle some more traditional conservative lawmakers including several Republican governors worried about the federal government impinging on individual state rights and governance. The White House has sought to stave off any discord by arguing that the order is not meant to take power away from the states but to ensure that state actions follow the intent of the Clean Water Act. Trade groups representing the oil and gas industry applauded the orders and said greater access to natural gas benefits families and the environment. When states say 'no' to the development of natural gas pipelines they force utilities to curb safe and affordable service and refuse access to new customers including new businesses said Karen Harbert president and CEO at the American Gas Association. Trump's move comes less than a week after nearly a dozen business groups told EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler that the environmental review and permitting process for energy infrastructure projects has become a target for environmental activists and states that oppose the production and use of fossil fuels. The groups said in an April 5 letter that individual states shouldn't be able to use provisions of the Clear Air Act to dictate national policy thereby harming other states and the national interest and damaging cooperative federalism. Washington state blocked the building of a coal terminal in 2017 saying there were too many major harmful impacts including air pollution rail safety and vehicle traffic. New York regulators stopped a natural gas pipeline saying it failed to meet standards to protect streams wetlands and other water resources. Under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act companies must get certification from the state before moving ahead with an energy project. One of Trump's planned executive orders calls for the Environmental Protection Agency to consult with states tribes and others before issuing new guidance and rules for states on how to comply with the law. Environmental groups described Trump's order as an effort to short circuit a state's ability to review complicated projects putting at risk a state's ability to protect drinking water supplies and wildlife. The Trump Administration's proposal would trample on state authority to protect waters within their own borders said Jim Murphy senior counsel for the National Wildlife Federation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The private Center for Biological Diversity said Wednesday's actions would mark the fourth time Trump has used executive orders to streamline permits for fossil fuel infrastructure. Trump's developing an addiction to executive orders that rubberstamp these climate killing projects said Brett Hartl government affairs director at the center. The second executive order Trump signed on Wednesday streamlines the process for energy infrastructure that crosses international borders. Currently the secretary of state has the authority to issue permits for cross border infrastructure such as pipelines. The executive order clarifies that the president will make the decision on whether to issue such permits. The move follows Trump's decision last month to issue a new presidential permit for the long stalled Keystone XL oil pipeline two years after he first approved it and more than a decade after it was first proposed. The Associated Press contributed to this report.	False	False	False	False	False
In the first significant check on the Trump administrations energy first agenda a US judge has temporarily halted hundreds of drilling projects for failing to take climate change into account. Drilling had been stalled on more than 300000 acres of public land in Wyoming after it was ruled the Trump administration violated environmental laws by failing to consider greenhouse gas emissions. The federal judge has ordered the Bureau of Land Management BLM which manages US public lands and issues leases to the energy industry to redo its analysis. The decision stems from an environmental lawsuit. WildEarth Guardians Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Western Environmental Law Center sued the BLM in 2016 for failing to calculate and limit the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from future oil and gas projects. The agency did not adequately quantify the climate change impacts of oil and gas leasing said Rudolph Contreras a US district judge in Washington DC in a ruling late on Tuesday. He added that the agency must consider the cumulative impact of GHG greenhouse gas emissions generated by past present and future BLM leases across the country. The decision is the first significant check on the climate impact of the Trump administrations energy first agenda that has opened up vast swaths of public land for mining and drilling. Environmental advocates are praising the move with Jeremy Nichols WildEarth Guardians Climate and Energy Program director calling it a triumph for our climate. This ruling says that the entire oil gas drilling program is off the rails and moving forward illegally said Nichols. Under Trump the pace of leasing public lands for oil and gas development has surged. A recent study found the administration has made more than 13m onshore acres available for leasing far more than any similar period under Obama. The vast majority are located in the western states of Colorado Montana New Mexico Nevada Utah and Wyoming. The administration also plans to make large portions of the Atlantic available for oil and gas development and the interior department has been criticized for favoring the energy industry. The BLM did not reply to a request for comment. The Western Energy Alliance one of the defendants in the case also did not respond to a request. Kathleen Sgamma its president told the Washington Post This judge has ignored decades of legal precedent in this ruling. The judge is basically asking BLM to take a wild guess on how many wells will be developed on leases prematurely. Nichols predicts there will be implications for public lands across the west. His group is now poised to bring litigation to block drilling on hundreds of thousands of acres in other states. With the science mounting that we need to aggressively rein in greenhouse gases this ruling is monumental said Kyle Tisdel attorney and energy and communities program director for the Western Environmental Law Center. Every acre of our public land sold to the oil and gas industry is another blow to the climate making this ruling a powerful reality check on the Trump administration and a potent tool for reining in climate pollution.

ASSOCIATED PRESS Sen. Bernie Sanders I Vt. is hosting a livestreamedsummit on climate change next month intensifying pressure on the new Congress and TV networks to devote attention to the crisis. We need millions of people all over this country to stand up and demand fundamental changes in our energy policy in order to protect our kids and our grandchildren and the planet Sanders told HuffPost by phone. The good news is the American people are beginning to stand up and fight back. The event bolsters Sandersa likely contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination as the most serious candidate on climate change offering a far more comprehensive response than rival progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren D Mass. who staked out a climate policy based on a bill to force public companies to disclose financial risk from warming or regulations to curb emissions. The summit which took months to plan will take place less than a month after Rep. elect Alexandria Ocasio Cortez D N.Y. propelled talk of a so called Green New Deal into the Democratic mainstream giving play for the first time to the sort of federal response to climate change scientists say is necessary to fully meet the scale of the crisis. In October the United Nations concluded world governments must halve emissions over the next 12 years or risk catastrophic warming with 54 trillion in damage. What we are seeing is a growing consciousness Sanders said. The horrors that weve seen in California in the largest forest fire that that state has ever experienced this is not going to be an anomaly unless we begin the long hard struggle to transform our energy system. Climate remains a low priority for most voters. Just 38 percent of registered voters said candidates positions on global warming would be very important to their voting decisions according to a Yale Program On Climate Change Communication survey published in May. Rising temperatures ranked 15th of 28 issues voters ranked in the questionnaire. In the lead up to the 2018 midterm elections the fossil fuel industry spent 100 million to crush pro climate ballot measures across the West and to prop up candidates who supported increased oil and gas extraction. Yet that base of climate hawks helped elect a cadre of Democrats whose urgent visions for climate action earned plaudits from a spectrum ranging from mainstream environmental groups to so called eco socialists. And a new majority of Democratic stateattorneys general are facing growing pressure to file lawsuits over climate damages. Activists freshly galvanized by the hellscape images of Californias deadliest wildfire seem primed for action and the partys progressive wing has signaled a new willingness to force a more serious debate over an issue thats remained stagnant in the House for much of the past decade. The fact that climate change is that high among the base of one of our two major political parties is remarkable because that was not the case even five years ago said Anthony Leiserowitz a senior research scientist and Yales climate program director. If you think of Bernie youd think hed be talking about inequality or civil rights. Theres a whole host of progressive issues yet this is the one hes leading with. It may suggest theres been an alignment of the stars. Last week youth activists with the grassroots climate group Sunrise Movement staged sit ins in the offices of House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi D Calif. and Rep. Frank Pallone D N.J. the likely next chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee who opposed the creation of a select committee on a Green New Deal. The horrors that weve seen in California in the largest forest fire that that state has ever experienced this is not going to be an anomaly unless we being the long hard struggle to transform our energy system. He helped popularize things like Medicare for All a living wage and a lot of other fights hes taken up said Varshini Prakash the co founder of Sunrise Movement. I hope he pushes for a Green New Deal and helps really add fuel to the fire thats been lit under politicians and the public over the past week. Sanders stopped short of endorsing the Green New Deal. But in April 2017 he co sponsored legislation to move the United States to 100 percent clean energy by 2050. The bill included 7 billion in targeted infrastructure and environmental investments in fossil fuel communities and called for union labor protections for workers on federally backed green jobs. In November 2017 Sanders introduced a bill to spend 146 billion rebuilding storm ravaged Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands with renewable energy. Seventy one percent of major televised debates in the 2018 midterm elections ignored the issue completely. Only four of the 107 segments ABC CBS and NBC aired from Nov. 8 to Nov. 13 on the deadly wildfires scorching California this month discussed climate change. In 2017 the influential Sunday morning talk shows on ABC CBS NBC and Fox News aired a combined 260 minutes of climate coverage 79 percent of which focused exclusively on President Donald Trumps personal beliefs on science and his decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement.

Last month during an episode of CNBCs Squawk Box Scott Pruitt the head of the Environmental Protection Agency said that he did not consider carbon emissions to be a primary contributor to global warming. Pruitt was pretty steadfast in his position then however on Sunday he was forced to entertain the possibility that he might be wrong during an interview with Fox Newss Chris Wallace. After referencing Pruitts statement from last month Wallace said that there are all kinds of studies that contradict him. The Fox News Sunday anchor went on to reference a report from the U.N. that says it is 95 percent likely that human activity has caused the majority of the warming that has taken place since the mid 20th century. The report also determines thatthere is more carbon dioxide now than in the last 400000 years and that2015 and 2016 were the two hottest years on record. After listing this information Wallace then asked Mr. Pruitt are we supposed to believe thats all a coincidence? Unable to give a straight answer Pruitt first admitted that human activity does contribute to the current warming trend. He then quickly moved on to accusing President Obama of reimagining authority with his clean power plan and praised Trumps recent executive order undoing environmental regulations that Obama put in place. Wallace quickly called Pruitt out on his inability to answer the question saying Sir youre sugar coating what you have said. You said there that you would not agree that carbon CO2 is a primary contributor to global warming. And the question I have is what if youre wrong? What if in fact the Earth is warming what if it is causing dramatic climate change and that we as humans through carbon emissions are contributing to it? Backed into a corner Pruitt conceded that CO2 does contribute to global warming although he followed up this concession by saying The issue is how much we contribute to it from a human activity perspective and what can be done about it from a process perspective. Wallace responded by asking But dont you think the fact that we have these coal power plants belching carbon emissions into the air you dont think that plays a role? Realizing that he wasnt going to get anywhere with Pruitt on that particular issue Wallace switched gears slightly to ask a final question about the Trump administrations proposed cuts to the EPA. Once again Pruitt took the question as an opportunity to criticize the Obama administration saying that in the past there has been a lack of commitment to state partnership. When Wallace asked him if he was sure that the states would pick up the slack Pruitt said that he had met with several governors who had confirmed that they would. Whether or not thats actually true remains to be seen. Watch the interview below via YouTube. Featured image is a screenshot from the video.	False	False	False	False	False
WASHINGTON The Supreme Court refused the Trump administration's request Friday to block21 young people from putting a warming planet on trial in Eugene Ore. Theaction keeps alive at least for nowanunusual lawsuit begun in 2015 to force a change in federal environmental policyby declaring a climate systemcapable of sustaining human life a civil right.The lawsuit was broughton behalf of children now ages 11 22as well as future generations. But while refusing to halt the trial the justices indicated that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit could do so if the Justice Department asks. That court has refused to intervene in the past. Associate Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissented presumably because they were prepared to stop the trial now. The justices had expressedmisgivings about the lawsuitin July when they refused to stop the legal process but said the breadthof theclaims was striking. Whether those claims should be handled in court presents substantial grounds for difference of opinion the court said then. Lawyers for Our Children's Trust have argued that government policies have deprived the children of their constitutional rights to life liberty and propertyto dignity to personal security to a stable climate system capable of sustaining human lives and liberties. They want the government toprepare an accounting of the nations greenhouse gas emissions and prepare and implement an enforceable national remedial plan for reducing carbon emissions. Federal district court Judge Ann Aiken who has presided over pretrial briefing for more than two years had scheduled the trial to begin Mondayand last up to 12 weeks. Courts have an obligation not to overstep the bounds of their jurisdiction but they have an equally important duty to fulfill their role as a check on any unconstitutional actions of the other branches of government she said last monthin denying the government's effort to stall or dismiss the trial. The Justice Departmentobjected to the time and expense claiming that the issue was one for Congress not the courts to resolve. Its objections were first raised during the Obama administration. This suit is an attempt to redirect federal environmental and energy policies through the courts rather than through the political process by asserting a new and unsupported fundamental due process right to certain climate conditions Solicitor General Noel Francisco argued in court papers. The children on whose behalf the lawsuit was filed he said can make no credible claim of imminent irreparable harm. Their alleged injuries stem from the cumulative effects of CO2emissions from every source in the world over decades. Although the case Juliana v. United States has yet to reach the trial stage it has been taught in more than two dozen law schools as well as primary and secondary schools lawyers for the children said inspiring students of all ages to see themselves in the parchment of the U.S. Constitution.

Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortezs newly released Green New Deal resolution has gotten a lot of attention for its 100 percent renewable energy goal but the bill also vaguely references another source of emissions. The resolution calls for aWorld War II style mobilization effort to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural operations. If thats the case that means any subsequent Green New Deal legislation would have to deal with a major source of methane emissions cow flatulence. Methane makes up 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions that scientists blame for global warming. Enteric fermentation the digestive process in cows and other ruminant animals is the largest source of U.S. methane emissions according to Environmental Protection Agency EPA data. EPA says cattle account for the majority of methane emissions in the United States for this source category referring to emissions from enteric fermentation. RELATED Alexandria Ocasio Cortez Green New Deal Is About Social Justice Being a non binding resolution the Green New Deal doesnt offer any specifics on how livestock emissions would be phased down or eliminated. The question then becomes How do you eliminate emissions from cows sheep and other animals? Certainly environmental groups have increasingly called for getting beef out of peoples diets in the name of the climate but there are legitimate worries doing so would be a net negative on overall public health. Some scientists have looked into reducing flatulence from ruminant animals. The U.S. government funded a 2014 study to find out why some types of sheep burped and farted more than others. The Obama administration released a plan to clamp down on methane emissions in 2014 which included programs to cut emissions from dairy operations. Republican lawmakers worried the Obama era effort could have resulted in new regulations or taxes on farmers. Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide but makes up a much smaller slice of Americas emissions profile. Natural gas systems and landfills also emit methane which Democrats and environmentalists want to regulate more.

In its report ETC insists that investments of up to 500 billion per annum would not pose a major macroeconomic challenge to nations accepting the call to fund the project. The group is made up of energy company executives activists investment bankers Al Gore and others who would financially benefit from the immense influx of funds the Daily Caller reports. According to the ETC website the groups goal is to accelerate change towards low carbon energy systems that enable robust economic development and limit the rise in global temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius. The chief avenue the group advocates to cut global warming is to force governments around the world to place an ever growing tax on carbon emissions as a means to force change in energy policy. The punishing taxes they say would cause the energy industry to seriously explore alternate energy sources and cut back use of fossil fuels. It recommends that the world cut emissions to a net zero by the year 2050 to hold back global heating. The group also calls for direct investment in green energy. ETC claims that the world must fundinvestment in renewables and other low carbon technologies some 6 trillion higher 300 billion per year while the largest required increases of almost 9 trillion 450 billion per year will be in more efficient energy saving equipment and buildings. ETC has focused its activism on the Paris climate agreement which President Obama signed onto without Senate approval. The plan was to take effect in 2016 but since coming to office President Trump has put a hold on much of the countrys compliance with the agreement. Trump has also begun considering whether or not to completely pull out of the agreement. Trumps Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt has urged the president to exit the agreement and at least one climate scientist Dr. Duane Thresher has warned Trump not to cave in to his daughters climate change madness.

BNP Paribas on Wednesday became the first big bank to pledge to stop financing natural gas fracking projects as part of a new policy cheered by environmentalists as having the greatest impact of any financial giant yet. Under the new policy Frances largest bank will refuse to lend to companies who generate more than half their revenue from fracked oil gas or liquefied natural gas export terminals. The rules also apply to tar sands considered one of the dirtiest sources of oil. Multinational banks including BNP Paribas began putting strict limits on funding for coal projects in 2015. At that point coal was becoming an unprofitable investment and banks faced mounting pressure from environmentalists to stop supporting the dirtiest fuels in the lead up the Paris climate agreement. Last month JPMorgan Chase became the target of a new campaign urging it to end financing for companies that drill tar sands a particularly dirty source of oil that forms the backbone of Canadas industry. Until now no financial giant has clamped down on natural gas which produces far less carbon dioxide than oil or coal. The fuel now provides most of the United States electricity and is credited with reducing emissions by weaning the country off coal. That has allowed advocates to tout the gas as a critical tool in the transition from heavily polluting fuels to renewable energy. But fracking an extraction technique that involves shooting a highly pressurized chemical and sand laced water into shale rock to extract oil and gas has become a lightning rod for environmentalists. It produces toxic wastewater and leaks emissions of methane a far more most potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. And the process of liquefying natural gas from vapor requires so much energy it ends up being as dirty as coal. The scientific literature on the climate impact of gas especially fracked gas is emerging Jason Disterhoft a senior campaigner at Rainforest Action Network told HuffPost by phone. Now that the prices of solar and wind energy were plummeting theres less need to use natural gas as a stepping stone between dirtier fossil fuels and renewables he added. BNP Paribas offered few details on its new policy including when it would go into effect though it said it should have an update by the end of the year. Europes second largest bank also said that companies could continue to receive backing if they lower the amount of revenue earned from fracking or tar sands to less than half their business. The exact ratio has not yet been decided a spokeswoman said. Even though were going to have this policy in place doesnt mean at the same time well right away cut all the clients that dont fall under it Mylene Benmoussa a BNP Paribas spokeswoman told HuffPost by phone on Wednesday. Its going to be a gradual and shared transition. The bank had not not yet calculated how many clients would be affected by the new policy and could not immediately respond to questions about how much money is invested in the targeted sectors. France banned fracking in 2011. The country generates 11 percent of its electricity from gas according to data from RTE the French transmission operator. And the government in Paris announced plans last month to prohibit oil and gas production by 2040. For a bank in the regulatory environment BNP Paribas is facing an aggressive climate policy makes business sense. Yet the announcement garnered praise from three environmental groups that teamed up to pressure BNP Paribas to curtail support for fossil fuels that pose a particular threat of exacerbating climate change. The trio includes the San Francisco based Rainforest Action Network the French chapter of Friends of Earth and Save the Rio Grande Valley from Liquefied Natural Gas a local Texas group protesting the construction of a liquefied natural gas terminal in the states southern region. Still the move represents a public relations victory for a bank plagued by scandals in recent years. In 2015 the company was ordered to pay 8.9 billion to the U.S. for violating sanctions against Sudan Cuba and Iran. In June three human rights groups accused BNP Paribas of complicity in the 1994 Rwandan genocide that killed more than 800000 people. In July the Federal Reserve fined the firm 246 million for its unsafe and unsound practices in foreign currency trading division failing to crack down on employees who violated rules on sharing information with competitors. Were a long standing partner to the energy sector and were determined to support the transition to a more sustainable world BNP Paribas CEO Jean Laurent Bonnaf said in a statement.As an international bank our role is to help drive the energy transition and contribute to the decarbonization of the economy.

But Pruitt has also been a reliable ally for President Donald Trump who made easing regulations on American industries a central campaign promise and the EPA administrator has proposed a slew of rollbacks for major environmental rules including those governing clean air and water and fighting climate change. Put together Pruitt's moves some of which have been challenged in court represent an attempt to fundamentally restructure the EPA's role in Washington and are a sharp rebuke of the environmental legacy of former President Barack Obama. Here are some of Pruitt's key changes Like others in the Trump administration Pruitt has repeatedly highlighted uncertainty about the role that humans have played in global warming a view that is at odds with the vast majority of scientific evidence. Last month the EPA circulated talking points instructing its staffers to say clear gaps exist in understanding whether human activity contributes to climate change. The EPA also removed references to climate change from several webpages according to an analysis by the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative. The weakening of automobile standards which is a win for car manufacturers and a blow to environmentalists also sets up a fight between the Trump administration and the state of California which says it plans to stick with the stricter rules. Proposing an overhaul of Obama era initiatives on coal ash In March the EPA proposed changes to the Obama era directive regulating coal ash waste giving states and utilities more power to manage their own disposal of it. The proposal according to The Washington Post includes more than a dozen changes for how coal ash which remains when coal is burned in power plants and electricity is generated is stored at coal fired power plants nationwide and would let states change how frequently they test for groundwater contamination. The decision was praised by industry officials who had called on Pruitt to revisit the rules but environmental groups said he was caving to special interests in the coal industry. The EPA announced in January that it was withdrawing the once in always in policy under the Clean Air Act that dictated how major sources of hazardous air pollutants are regulated. The decades old policy was opposed by fossil fuel companies but environmental groups argued that its withdrawal would result in more pollution. The EPA announced in January that it would suspend the Waters of the United States rule which was designed to limit pollution in roughly 60 of the country's bodies of water. Critics said the rule was overly broad in classifying waterways that are subject to federal rules while supporters see it as a necessary protection for example preventing fertilizer runoff from tainting streams and drinking water. Pruitt announced in October his decision to withdraw from the Clean Power Plan the Obama era rule intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants across the country. The Clean Power Plan had a goal of decreasing the country's carbon pollution by roughly one third by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. Under Pruitt the EPA tried to suspend an Obama era rule to restrict methane emissions from new oil and gas wells. But a federal court ruled in August that the EPA must enforce the Obama administration's regulation. Pushing to withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord Pruitt pushed the White House to leave the Paris climate deal stood beside the President in the Rose Garden when he announced the decision and after the President spoke offered his own remarks. The move was condemned by global leaders and was seen by many as a setback to efforts to address global warming.	False	False	False	False	False
The office issued news releases relating to investigations at a dizzying rate with less emphasis on follow through or actual results said Caroline Polisi a white collar defense lawyer who has appeared as a legal commentator on cable news shows. But Ms. Polisi added that there had been considerable substance to a number of Mr. Schneidermans investigations as well as some major successes. Mr. Schneidermans big accomplishment in going after Wall Street were the billions of dollars in penalties that he helped secure from big banks that had sold flawed mortgage backed bonds during the run up to the financial crisis. He ensured that some of that money went to help communities across the state that were overrun by abandoned houses and foreclosures often referred to as zombie homes. His legal team was one of the first in the nation to target banks for sponsoring nontransparent trading platforms called dark pools which allowed high speed trading firms to take advantage of investors. In 2016 Mr. Schneiderman and the Securities and Exchange Commission announced a 154 million settlement with Barclays and Credit Suisse to resolve allegations that the banks had permitted traders to misuse their dark pool platforms. Three years ago he opened an investigation with the Massachusetts attorney general into whether Exxon Mobil deliberately misled the public and investors about the impact of climate change. In 2015 Mr. Schneidermans office opened an investigation into the mortgage practices of Caliber Home Loans a fast growing lender but has said nothing about the inquiry since then. A spokeswoman said that the office generally avoided providing details about the number of open investigations. But Barbara Underwood who was named New Yorks acting attorney general on Tuesday said in a statement that the offices work continues without interruption. Mr. Schneiderman over the past year has positioned himself at the vanguard of legal challenges by state attorneys general to the Trump administrations efforts to roll back regulation especially environmental rules. Last month he and more than a dozen states sued the E.P.A. for failing to properly control methane pollution a greenhouse gas.	False	False	False	False	False
A Green Island moss bank with icebergs.Credit Matt Amesbury Antarctica is a cold white continent at the bottom of the world. Or so it has been for thousands of years. New evidence points to a sharp increase in biological activity in recent decades across the Antarctic Peninsula resulting in large swaths of newfound greenery. Published in the journal Current Biology a new study found major increases in Antarctic moss growth over the past 50 years which the team of researchers attributes to temperature rises in the region. another clear sign that the biology of the planet is changing as a result of warming temperatures said Professor Dan Charman of the University of Exeter who led the research project. surprised us was just how rapid the changes have been and the fact that they are very unusual when compared with growth rates in the late 19th and early 20th century. Charman said their evidence shows just how fast Antarctic land surface can change along with climactic changes. The Antarctic Peninsula is among the most rapidly warming areas in the world with temperatures having increased by almost three degrees Celsius over the last 50 years. In March a research base near the northern tip of the Antarctic peninsula set a heat record of 17.5 degrees Celsius 63.5 Fahrenheit. Currently plant life only exists on about 0.3 of Antarctica. Charman said that while as the Arctic warms a variety of plant life and soil organisms can migrate north in Antarctica there are no nearby land areas for species to colonize from. But while no new natural plant life is anticipated existing plant life such as Antarctic hairgrass and Antarctic pearlwort could occupy new ice free ground as glaciers retreat. Dr. Matt Amesbury also of the University of Exeter said there were two main findings to take from their new study scale and temperature sensitivity Before now studies have been from single sites but using a transect of sites weve been able to show that this significant response to climate change is pervasive across the whole of the Antarctic Peninsula. The second important point is our finding which suggests that moss growth has been highly sensitive to temperature change since the 1950sunder future warming scenarios this means we are likely to see a greening of the Antarctic Peninsula both in terms of further increases in growth rates and also expansion of mosses and other plant life.

Reuters The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will unveil a proposal to speed state level permitting decisions for energy infrastructure projects soon the agencys chief told Reuters on Thursday blasting states that have blocked coal terminals and gas pipelines on environmental grounds. President Donald Trump is seeking to boost domestic fossil fuels production over the objections of Democrats and environmentalists concerned about pollution and climate change. On Wednesday he issued a pair of executive orders targeting the power of states to delay energy projects. We started working on it in advance so we hope to have something out soon EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in an interview. He was unable to provide a precise timeline. Based on Trumps orders Wheelers EPA has been tasked with clarifying a section of the U.S. Clean Water Act that has allowed states like New York and Washington to delay projects in recent years. New York has used the section to delay pipelines that would bring natural gas to New England for example and Washington state has stopped coal export terminals that would open the Asian market for struggling coal companies in Wyoming and other landlocked western states. They are trying to make international environmental policy Wheeler said of Washington state whose governor Democrat Jay Inslee is running for president on a climate change focused platform. Theyre trying to dictate to the world how much coal is used. Wheeler said New York which amid strong public pressure denied a clean water act permit for construction of a natural gas pipeline to New England is forcing that region to use Russian produced natural gas. We are importing Russian natural gas which is not produced in an environmentally conscious manner. If the states that are blocking the pipelines were truly concerned about the environment they would look to where the natural gas would be coming from I think its very short sighted he said. Wheeler said the EPA would not prevent a state from vetoing a project but would clarify the parameters they should be able to consider and the length of time they have to do so. He also said that California is playing politics in its fight with the EPA to preserve its more stringent vehicle emission standards as the national standard. Wheeler said he believes climate change is a problem but that it had been overblown by former President Barack Obamas administration at the expense of other bigger issues like water quality. Yes climate is an issue and we are working to address it but I think water is a bigger issue he said. Wheeler dismissed the findings of a report released earlier this week by EPA scientists in the journal Nature Climate Change that detailed the scale and urgency of climate change. He said while he encouraged EPA scientists to carry out and publish research he stressed the recent paper did not reflect EPA policy. Environmental groups say the EPAs replacement of an Obama era rule limiting carbon emissions from power plants would likely lead to increased emissions by allowing older more polluting coal plants to operate longer. Asked whether the replacement the Affordable Clean Energy rule which gives states responsibility for regulating emissions is stringent enough Wheeler said it adheres to the parameters of federal law. I think what is effective regulation is one that follows the law and one that will be held up in court he said. Several Democrats challenging Trump in the 2020 election have made climate change a top tier issue embracing aggressive policy platforms like the Green New Deal calling for an end of fossil fuels use. Asked whether he was concerned that the EPA may be out of synch with polls showing an overwhelming number of young people believe climate change should be a priority issue Wheeler was dismissive. I do fear that because so many people only talked about climate change. Youre right there could very well be a new generation coming up saying thats the only environmental issue and its not he said.

If We Bring The Good Life To All Will We Destroy The Planet? Our blog often features stories about efforts to improve life for this planet's 7 billion inhabitants How to make sure everyone has access to clean water and power medical care to stay healthy enough income to feed their kids education for the children so they can fulfill their potential. But a new study in the Journal Nature Sustainability poses a question not often considered If we were to succeed in providing all this what would be the cost to the environment? In other words can our planet actually sustain the good life for all? As we improve the human condition building sanitation facilities and expanding farming to provide more food for example we necessarily damage the environment. We cut down trees we put fertilizers in the soil that kill off aquatic life we pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. So to figure out if we can meet everyone's basic needs without destroying the planet we need to know For each bit of progress on the human front how much harm is done on the environmental side? To find out Daniel O'Neill an economist at the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom and several collaborators came up with 11 indicators that a country has met the needs of its citizens. They range from boosting life expectancy above age 65 to ensuring that at least 95 percent of its adult population has graduated from high school has access to sanitation and earns more than the extreme poverty line of 1.90 a day. Then they looked at seven key ways in which humans damage the environment. For each of these scientists have calculated what degree of damage would put the planet at risk. In the case of carbon emissions for instance the threshold is the total amount that humanity can emit before we will cause the planet to warm enough to trigger catastrophic weather changes. From that we can calculate a carbon budget for the rest of the century notes O'Neill. And then dividing that by the number of people on the planet we can say 'okay this is the carbon budget per person.' Then they analyzed the data on 150 countries to determine how they scored on both the environmental and the social fronts. The hope was to find at least a few examples of countries that were simultaneously delivering the good life to their citizens while staying within their per capita boundaries for environmental damage in other words using natural resources at a rate that would be sustainable even if every person on the planet matched it. Unfortunately we really didn't find that says O'Neill. Instead says O'Neill generally the countries that do well on the social indicators do so by consuming resources at a level that could not be extended to all people on the planet. These include Germany the Netherlands and Austria. And the countries that do well on the environmental indicators in other words that are consuming resources at a sustainable level don't do well on the social indicators. Examples include Malawi Yemen and the Philippines. There are also five countries that do damage above all seven of the environmental boundaries even as they fail to achieve all 11 social indicators. This includes the United States which misses the mark when it comes to income equality and employment. China is arguably in even worse shape. It exceeds its per capita limits on five of the seven environmental thresholds yet only delivers on three of the social measures. Only one country comes even close to delivering the good life in a sustainable way Vietnam succeeds on six of social indicators including a life expectancy above 65 years and providing sufficient nutrition while staying within its limit on every environmental threshold except carbon emissions. What does this all mean for humanity? It's a worrying finding says O'Neill. But he cautions against concluding that there's simply no way for everyone to enjoy a decent life without destroying the planet. After all these findings are based on how we are doing things now he says. We certainly hope it's possible to do things better to achieve a high level of human well being at a much lower level of resource use. And he adds that this study actually points to one way to do that. Specifically O'Neill and his fellow researchers ran statistical tests to determine for each environmental measure how much damage it takes to produce a corresponding improvement on each of the social well being indicators. And what we find is that it follows a curve of diminishing returns as you use more resources you get less social bang for your buck says O'Neill. So there's a turning point after which additional resource use contributes very little to social performance. Wealthy industrialized nations such as the United States the United Kingdom and Canada have now reached that point says O'Neill. As we increase our resource use we get almost no increase in human well being from that. And this means the strategy of growing the economy basically trying to create new wealth to boost the well being of its underprivileged citizens is ineffective. A much better approach argues O'Neill would be to focus on redistributing the wealth we already have more equitably. And if high income countries were to adapt such a philosophy says O'Neill they could reduce their use of resources. And that he says would free up the ecological space for poor nations for whom using resources still does make a big impact in improving people's lives.	False	False	False	False	False
Trump speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Thursday after touring damage from Hurricane Irma on Florida's west coast said we've had bigger storms than this when asked about climate change. If you go back into the 1930s and the 1940s and you take a look we've had storms over the years that have been bigger than this Trump said. If you go back into the teens you'll see storms that were as big or bigger. So we did have two horrific storms epic storms but if you go back into the '30s and '40s and you go back into the teens you'll see storms that were very similar and even bigger OK? In response to this story a White House aide pointed CNN to a recent NOAA report that found that it is premature to conclude that human activities ... have already had a detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane or global tropical cyclone activity. That same report however found that human activity may have already caused changes and that global warming will likely cause tropical cyclones globally to be more intense on average and lead to an increase in the occurrence of very intense tropical cyclones. Trump campaigned on a platform that rejected much of the scientific community's findings on climate change arguing that the Obama administration used climate science too often to restrict business growth. Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate accords earlier this year and had previously had called climate change a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. Trump's comments Thursday go against the hyperbolic language he used in the lead up and aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma. Hurricane Irma is of epic proportion perhaps bigger than we have ever seen Trump tweeted as Irma moved closer to Florida. Earlier this month he tweeted Hurricane looks like largest ever recorded in the Atlantic! And on Thursday in Florida before his comments aboard Air Force One about climate change Trump said the people of Florida experienced something the likes of which we can say really say nobody's ever seen before. They've never seen a category like this come in because it came in really at a five he said. Top Trump administration officials have repeatedly dodged questions about how climate change affected the damage done by hurricanes Harvey and Irma saying the issue should be discussed at a later date. said last week it was insensitive to address global warming at this time. said last week it was insensitive to address global warming at this time. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said last week it was insensitive to address global warming at this time. Mick Mulvaney the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget told CNN that climate change is a longer discussion on another day and a big topic for the media. And both FEMA administrator Brock Long and acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke avoided explicitly answering when asked Tuesday whether the government needs to be more focused on climate change because of the storms. Trump's visit to tour hurricane damage on Thursday was his second trip in as many weeks. Trump toured the Houston area earlier this month after Hurricane Harvey brought massive flooding to the city. The storm and subsequent damage could end up being the costliest natural disaster in US history.	False	False	False	False	False
What is the goal of a funeral? Is it to pay tribute to a life lost? To commit the soul of the decedent to his final reward? Or an opportunity to extolyour passion for environmental justice? A recent Vox piece by Dean Peterson states with dogged solemnity that modern burials are awful for the environment and has an accompanying video whose combination of animation the veneer of open mindedness and a vocally inflective narrator discreetly blurs the line between providing information and outright advocacy. Its yet another instance of the environmentally conscious Left virtue signaling about the negative effects of nearly everything human beings do Not even the way we mourn our dead is safe from their parade of moral superiority. The piece and video discuss the environmental effects of American funerals with their caskets embalming fluid and grave sites. The piece claims the average burial costs up to 12000 though the National Funeral Directors Associations most recent report indicated average costs almost 3500 less than that. Either way thats a lot of money of course but the point is not to expiate upon the market forces driving prices in the funeral industry. What is most remarkable is the pieces bizarre stance on this debate Petersons primary concern appears to be getting rid of Grandma with as small of a carbon footprint as possible rather than reverence intergenerational remembrance or even concern for the grieving. We all hold a hierarchy of values. For most people of good conscience the value of a human beings life supersedes that of our dog or a backyard plant. We make decisions every day accordingly. We routinely delay temporal pleasure for example in the hopes of attaining goals we hold in higher esteem such as when we diet exercise or volunteer. Each individual has values good and bad and they often remain in tension with one another. It is after all the measure of ones moral fitness to value some things say forgiveness over others vengeance. What makes radical environmentalism and its private jet flying propagators so toxic a cultural beast is how high on its adherents totem pole they are willing to place environmental concerns often over some of the most elemental human needs and desires. The wish to have additional children for example is a cause for deep apprehension among environmentalists who seem all at once indifferent and tone deaf to how out of touch such a sentiment is. In this Vox piece it appears that some environmentalists have shifted focused to the other side of lifes journey death and more specifically how we bury our loved ones. For most normal people funerary concerns are primarily about memorializing the deceased within the reasonable bounds of ones budget. Petersons video notes that in this strange race to the environmental bottom some advocates believe burying Aunt Lisa in a casket is an alarming degradation of the environment some might even want her tossed straight into the ground. Maybe he suggests readers could consider freezing their bodies with liquid nitrogen or having their ashes turned into a coral reef. Its an odd calculus at play in the authors mind where the ultimate barometer of a funerals efficacy is its environmental impact statement. Its totally legitimate to criticize modern burials on its face the piece seems a cogent critique of excesses in the funeral industry. But what is particularly troubling about Voxs article is its larger point that we as humans must give perpetual deference to some vague conception of environmentalism at most any cost. As the oft repeated refrain goes is environmentalist hysteria the inevitable fate of a society that ceases to believe in God? When organized religion fades and its would be adherents are left to search for meaning does the god of the environment end their search for a moral authority? Pardon the extended biblical analogy but Voxs piece sounds more than a bit like Judas Iscariots laments about the funeral rituals performed on Christ. When Mary Magdalene anoints Christ with perfumes and oil as a pre burial ritual on a night leading up to His execution a livid Judas berates her gesture protesting that the money used to buy the perfume could have been spent on the poor. Johns Gospel provides the relevant addendum He did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief as keeper of the money bag he used to help himself to what was put into it. That statement not only describes Judass moral disorder but also reminds the audience that any concern holy as it may be poverty reduction environmental protection or any other earthly mission that does not give a preferential deference to God His creation and acts of beauty such as that of Mary Magdalene are sure signs of misaligned priorities. This piece from Vox forces us to ask the question At what point does genuine concern for the environment turn into a power grab so vicious that one would rather soak Grandpa in liquid nitrogen than give him a proper burial?

Before I address that question I just stumbled upon an article in the August 1 Washington Post. There the Post updated its truth squad totals on Donald Trump 4229 false and misleading statements in 558 days. I then reflected upon Anderson Coopers infamous April 17 2018 CNN interview of Jim Jordan. In that interview a fumbling Jordan firmly insisted to Coopers amazement that he never heard Trump lie. This is the same Jim Jordan who less than three months later saw no evil and heard no evil in the Ohio State sex scandal that victimized some of Jordans former wrestling students. I wondered to myself how Jordans credibility would hold up when cross examined in court on this issue now that these incredible statements are in the public domain. No wonder Trump loves Jordan! Every word Trump speaks is the Truth in Jordans world. Sure Jordans a politician and all politicians lie at some time or anothersee Adams . But its quite another thing when you live your entire Congressional career as one big liea lie that causes long term harm not only to the folks living in your district but the country as a whole. Nowhere is that lie more obvious than in Jim Jordans approach to global warming and general environmental issues. And heres why Jordan will live on in villainy. In July 2008 after being in Congress for a year and a half Jim Jordan was the first member of Congress to sign the No Climate Tax Pledge. Yes the first to sign his initial salvo in an unrelenting fight he wages against our planet. The pledge or vow is the product of Americans for Prosperity the conservative political advocacy group funded by David and Charles Koch. This is the outfit that went to war with the Obama Administration initiatives to combat global warming. The promise itself is significant for a couple of reasons 1 it opposes any legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in government revenue 2 it drives the final nail in the coffin of environmental bipartisanship which had been the norm for decades. Lets take a closer look at this. First 71 of Americans now think that most scientists believe global warming is occurring 68 of Americans believe global warming is caused by human activities. March 14 2017 Gallup poll. Record percentages of Americans are now concerned about global warming. I would predict the same percentages of belief would apply to Jordans Ohio 4th Congressional District plus or minus a few points. But Jordan wanted to be the first congressman in the USA to sell out the voters of a congressional districtnever mind it had to be his own. He couldnt wait to curry favor with the Koch boys and sign on the dotted line. What hes really saying is Regardless how bad it gets how severe the droughts how out of control the forest fires how strong the tornadoes and hurricanes how hot the summers how cold the winters how deep the floods how devastating the blizzards how much the ice caps melt how high the oceans rise I will not vote to tax tariff or otherwise increase revenues to cap the use of fossil fuels unless that money is cut or borrowed from somewhere else in the budget. And in Jordans case that would be Social Security Medicare education health care and the like Programs that benefit folks in his district. So from that July day in 2008 Jordan waged his own war on the environment Voting to bar greenhouse gasses from Clean Air Act rules voting against enforcing limits on carbon dioxide global warming pollution against tax incentives for renewable electricity and energy conservation against curtailing subsidies for oil and gas company exploration but voting in favor of opening the Outer Continental Shelf to oil drilling. The League of Conservation Voters National Environmental Scorecard awarded Jordan a perfect 0 score for his 2017 record and a lifetime score of 4 for his work. The saddest part of this story however is the depth weve descended into the abyss of partisanship on environmental issues. These were matters that we have historically agreed on if for no other reason than the sake of our children and grandchildrens future. For example in 1969 Congress passed the landmark National Environmental Policy Act NEPA. This revolutionary piece of legislation unanimously passed the Senate the vote in the House was 372 Years with only 15 Nays. Nixon signed it into law on New Year's Day 1970. Now thanks to guys like Jordan NEPA would not even be brought to the floor for a vote if it were introduced in todays Congress. In contrast Janet Garrett by philosophy an environmentalist will push for and support an agenda that will guarantee clean water clean air and the reduction of greenhouse gasses. Garrett knows the value of Environmental Protection on those who knowingly violate our statutes Janet will push for criminal enforcement. Garrett will defend our National Park system and public lands as she understands the need to preserve the earth for her children and grandchildren. To Janet this is a moral issue. Please support Janet Garrett in her efforts to replace Jordan in Congress.	False	False	False	False	False
The Amazon is burning at an alarming rate in Brazil with 72843 fires detected so far this year by the countrys space research center INPE. That amounts to an 83 percent increase over the same period in 2018 and the highest number since the agency started recording fires in 2013 meaning it is likely the highest number of fires to date. The sudden spike has prompted renewed concern that the destruction of the Amazon basin is the result of right wing President Jair Bolsonaros environmental policies that dont give much thought to the environment at all. The smoke from the fires has been so bad that when carried by the wind it caused an hourlong blackout in nearby So Paulo. The right wing populist Bolsonaro who has shown disdain for protecting the Amazonhome to 3 million species of plants and animals and 1 million or so peoplecame to power in January. The Bolsonaro regime has reversed previous governments efforts to enforce environmental regulations and protect what is the largest rainforest in the world. Over the past decade previous governments had managed to reduce deforestation with action by federal agencies and a system of fines. But Mr Bolsonaro and his ministers have criticised the penalties and overseen a fall in confiscations of timber and convictions for environmental crimes the BBC reports. Last monththe far right president accused Inpes director of lying about the scale of deforestationin the Amazon and trying to undermine the government. It came after Inpe published data showing an 88 percent increase in deforestation there in June compared to the same month a year ago. Conversely NASA has reported overall fire activity in the Amazon basin has been slightly below average. Since Thursday INPE said satellite images spotted 9507 new forest fires in the country mostly in the Amazon basin home to the worlds largest tropical forest seen as vital to countering global warming Reuters reports. Wildfires have increased in Mato Grosso and Para two states where Brazils agricultural frontier has pushed into the Amazon basin and spurred deforestation. Wildfires are common in the dry season but are also deliberately set by farmers illegally deforesting land for cattle ranching. Bolsonaro dismissed alarm over the latest data saying it was simply the season that farmers use open fires to clear farmland. I used to be called Captain Chainsaw. Now I am Nero setting the Amazon aflame he said.	False	False	False	False	False
