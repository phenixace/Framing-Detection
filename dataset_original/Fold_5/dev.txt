559	rt	questionable_source	2018-03-21	'Next Deepwater Horizon disaster a matter of time': Critics slam record offshore oil lease sale The Trump administration has held the biggest lease sale of oil and gas in US history. Environmentalists fear the auction will massively expand fossil fuel production and could lead to the next Deepwater disaster. President Donald Trump on Wednesday sold more than 77 million acres of federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore oil drilling, an area twice the size of Florida. The lease sale forms part of the Trump administration's plans to increase domestic energy production by opening up new areas for oil drilling. Oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico became increasingly controversial after the BP Deepwater Horizon disaster in 2010, which killed 11 workers and released millions of barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The catastrophe caused  $17.2 billion-worth of damage to natural resources, according to a study in 2017 commissioned by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Critics of the sale fear the expansion in offshore drilling could devastate marine life and lead to roll-backs in environmental protections. "Trump is selling off our oceans and selling out coastal communities and marine life to the oil industry," said Kristen Monsell, oceans program legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity." ore drilling and less regulation will make the next Deepwater Horizon disaster only a matter of time. Whales, dolphins and Gulf seafood are already marinating in oil spills and industry wastewater," she added. The Interior Department said the sell-off is necessary if America is to maintain energy independence. "American energy production can be competitive," said Vincent DeVito, an energy policy advisor at the Interior Department." eople need jobs, the Gulf Coast states need revenue, and Americans do not want to be dependent on foreign oil." he said. The Gulf of Mexico provides the US with around 1.5 million barrels of oil per day, or roughly 17 percent of its national production total, according to the Energy Information Administration. US  crude oil output has grown by more than 20 percent since mid-2016. The oil industry welcomed the lease sale, with Randall Luthi of the trade group National Oceanic Industry Association noting that the sale on Wednesday "may draw more interest from industry than we have seen in recent years." Meanwhile some NGOs have questioned the economic rationale behind the sale, arguing that the way in which federal assets are sold off does not serve the best interests of US taxpayers. The Project on Government Oversight warned in February that the 'uncompetitive' lease system used by the government to auction sites allows energy companies to "secure offshore leases for a pittance." It cautioned that the sale in the Gulf of Mexico means "more publicly owned resources could be turned over to industry at bargain-basement prices." The Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy think tank has echoed this statement, saying in a statement that "offering a nearly unrestricted supply in a low demand market with a cut rate royalty and almost no competition is bad policy and an inexcusable waste of taxpayer resources."

813	The Guardian	left_center_bias	2017-07-18	California lawmakers extend program to cut emissions in bipartisan vote California legislators have voted to extend a centerpiece program to cut greenhouse gas emissions, burnishing the state's reputation as a bulwark against Donald Trump's demolition of climate change measures. In a rare show of bipartisan agreement on climate change, eight Republicans joined with Democrats in California's two legislative houses to extend the cap-and-trade emissions system a further 10 years until 2030. The emissions-lowering scheme, the second-largest of its kind in the world, aims to help the state reach its target of cutting planet-warming gases 40% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels." onight, California stood tall and once again, boldly confronted the existential threat of our time," said Jerry Brown, California's governor. "Republicans and Democrats set aside their differences, came together and took courageous action. That's what good government looks like." The cap-and-trade program, established in 2006 under then governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, sets a limit on emissions and requires polluters to either reduce their output or purchase permits from those who have. As the limit steadily becomes stricter, it nudges businesses to take the more financially attractive option of cutting their pollution. California, the sixth-largest economy in the world, is in stark opposition to Trump's administration. The president has said he will withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement and has set about dismantling federal policies that lower emissions. Brown has positioned himself as a countervailing force to Trump, visiting China to talk to its leaders about climate change and promising to build and launch weather-monitoring satellites should federal budget cuts endanger programs handled by Nasa and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOOA)."  lot of you people are going to be alive, and you're going to be alive in a horrible situation," Brown told Californian lawmakers at a committee hearing shortly before the vote. "This isn't for me, I'm going to be dead. This is for you, and it's real." Many Californian Republicans remain opposed to the cap-and-trade system, warning it will pose a "crushing" blow to small businesses. But the bill ended up gaining an unusual level of Republican support, with the extension also supported by key conservative constituencies, including the California Chamber of Commerce and associations representing manufacturers and agriculture interests. Concessions to get some Republican support, such as the limiting of separate regulations on refineries, risked alienating more liberal Democrats. Some environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, attacked the bill for allowing polluters to continue emitting greenhouse gases if they offset them with green projects, including those outside California. But other climate activists declared themselves pleased with the outcome, pointing out that it showed that action to reduce emissions is bipartisan and popular." alifornia is once again showing Washington DC and the rest of the world that fighting climate and air pollution is the right thing for our health, economy and future," said Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund. California's pioneering attitude to climate change action was underlined by separate court action launched on Monday, aimed at holding fossil fuel companies accountable for global warming. Marin and San Mateo counties, along with the City of Imperial Beach, filed a lawsuit in the California superior court to complain that 37 oil, gas and coal companies knew burning their products would increase carbon pollution and cause sea levels rise." efendants have known for nearly 50 years that greenhouse gas pollution from their fossil fuel products has a significant impact on the Earth's climate and sea levels," the complaint states. The municipalities are claiming damages from the fossil fuel firms, echoing a strategy used against the tobacco industry in the 1990s that resulted in multibillion dollar payouts. The companies targeted in the lawsuit include Shell, Exxon Mobile, Chevron and BP. According to the municipalities, these businesses have caused around 20% of all industrial carbon dioxide and methane pollution since the 1960s.	True	False	False	False	True
174	cnbc	left_center_bias	2019-01-02	Trump's war on energy and environmental regulation is about to face the 'Spanish Inquisition' President Donald Trump set in motion a vast rollback of energy, climate and environmental regulations during his first two years in office. Over the next two years, those actions will face intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill. On Thursday, Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives and the committees that conduct government oversight. Within the first few months of the year, incoming committee chairs intend to hold a series of hearings to pick apart Trump's energy and environmental policies and what role industry insiders played in crafting them. The Trump administration has targeted dozens of rules. Some of the biggest items on its agenda include withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate agreement, expanding drilling on federal lands, and watering down rules ranging from limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants to fuel efficiency in cars and trucks. Rep. Raul Grijalva, the Arizona Democrat tipped to chair the House Natural Resources Committee, says Americans can expect the committee to probe the financial costs and public health risks associated with Interior Department policies under Trump. Those include rolling back methane emissions rules from oil and gas operations and making virtually all federally administered offshore waters available to drillers." The Trump administration has spent two years giving away the store to fossil fuel companies, and Republicans in Congress cheered every step of the way," says Grijalva. "We need to know what kind of impact this corporate favoritism is having on average Americans' health and quality of life."	True	False	True	False	False
520	cbsnews	left_center_bias	2018-05-02	California, 16 other states sue EPA over auto emissions rollbacks California and 16 other states sued the Trump administration Tuesday over its plan to scrap Obama-era auto-emissions standards that would require vehicles to get significantly higher gas mileage by 2025. At issue is a move by Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt to roll back 2012 rules aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions. Under those rules, vehicles would have to get 36 miles of real-world driving per gallon, about 10 miles over the existing standard." Pollutants coming out of vehicles, out of the tailpipe, does permanent lung damage to children living near well-traveled roads and freeways. This is a fact. The only way we're going to overcome that is by reducing emissions," Gov. Jerry Brown said in announcing the lawsuit along with other top California Democrats. The rules were set six years ago when California and the Obama administration agreed to a single nationwide fuel economy standard. Pruitt, who has sought to block or delay an array of environmental regulations, has argued that assumptions about gas prices and vehicle technology used by the Obama administration to set the standards were too optimistic. And he said the standards would hurt automakers and consumers who can't afford or don't want to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles. Automakers have likewise argued that the Obama-era rules would cost the industry billions of dollars and raise vehicle prices because of the cost of developing the necessary technology. EPA representatives did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the lawsuit. California officials say the standards are achievable and the EPA's effort to repeal them is not based on any new research. They argue the plan violates the federal Clean Air Act and didn't follow the agency's own regulations. California has a unique waiver that allows it to set its own tailpipe emissions standards for vehicles, which it has used to combat smog and, more recently, global warming. Thirteen other states and the District of Columbia have adopted the California standards as their own. California has now sued the Trump administration more than 30 times on topics including immigration and health care policy." The world is not flat, pollution is not free, and the health and safety of our children is not for sale," said Democratic state Attorney General Xavier Becerra, standing alongside the governor. Brown, who has made fighting climate change a core of his policy and political platform, said the state's battles with Washington over climate are the most essential." If we follow the Pruitt-Trump path, we follow our way off the cliff to disaster," he said. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Joining California were Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Virginia and the District of Columbia. All have Democratic attorneys general.	True	False	True	False	False
630	NewsBusters	right_bias	2017-09-13	86 Percent Negative: Media Scold Trump on Climate, Cite 'World of Opposition' The twin disasters of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma showcased once again the media's reflex to use such tragedies to push for liberal climate change policies.  In their pursuit of this agenda, the broadcast networks' have heavily criticized the Trump administration's policies on the environment. From January 20 through August 31, MRC analysts tallied 75 stories discussing the President and climate change, totaling 73 minutes, 43 seconds of network airtime.  The commentary in these stories was as one-sided as the rest of Trump's coverage has been, with 88 percent of evaluative statements criticizing the President, vs. a mere 12 percent that praised him. Methodology: Our measure of spin was designed to isolate the networks' own slant, not the back-and-forth of partisan politics. Thus, our analysts ignored soundbites which merely showcased the traditional party line (Republicans supporting Trump, Democrats criticizing him), and instead tallied evaluative statements which imparted a clear positive or negative tone to the story, such as statements from experts presented as non-partisan, voters, or opinionated statements from the networks' own reporters. Using these criteria, MRC analysts tallied 121 evaluative statements about the Trump administration's approach to the environment from January 20 to August 31, 2017, of which 106 (88%) were negative vs. a mere 15 (12%) which were positive. This study does not look at all climate change-related stories during this time frame. Instead, it covers specifically the coverage of President Trump's environmental agenda on ABC World News Tonight, CBS Evening News and NBC Nightly News. The most consistent factor in all of this coverage was the criticism. NBC Nightly News correspondent Matt Bradley's July 30 quip that "President Donald Trump shifts American climate commitments into reverse" was typical of the media attitude towards the president's environmental policies. On June 2, Nightly News correspondent Kristen Welker promoted an anti-Trump protest over this decision, hyping "the backlash is only heating up." The same night, CBS Evening News's anchor Anthony Mason spoke of the "world of opposition to withdraw from the Paris climate accord." Correspondent Chip Reid echoed by referencing "worldwide condemnation." NBC Nightly News, anchor Savannah Guthrie on June 1 criticized the move to withdraw from the climate treaty: "detractors say it is a stunning abandonment of the U.S.'s leadership in the world, and a grave threat to the planet itself." To their credit, CBS stood alone in interviewing a conservative to hear the other side of the climate change debate. On April 22, CBS Evening News, correspondent Dean Reynolds noted that Joe Bast, CEO of The Heartland Institute, "looks with approval on Mr. Trump's decision to roll back regulations limiting greenhouse gases, and to his appointments of fellow skeptics in the administration. Climate change, he [Bast] says, is a naturally occurring cyclical phenomenon caused mostly by the sun, not an approaching disaster accelerated by carbon dioxide emissions caused by humans." However, before stating this position, Reynolds noted that "most climate scientists, the United Nations, as well as NASA, dismiss these arguments as propaganda for fossil fuels. On March 28 NBC Nightly News profiled "celebrations in coal country" over Trump's environmental proposals, mentioning a barber shop in West Virginia where "they cheered the move, hoping it will bring back jobs." Afterwards, correspondent Kristen Welker noted that "federal data shows mines have been losing jobs for decades under both parties. Right now, there are less than seventy-five thousand coal jobs, compared to more than six hundred and fifty thousand in renewable energy, which can be less expensive to produce."

719	The Huffington Post	left_bias	2017-06-28	'You Are A Climate Denier': Protesters Interrupt Rick Perry's Speech At Energy Conference Energy Secretary Rick Perry offered little explanation when protesters pressed him to explain his position on climate change at an energy conference on Tuesday. Instead, he opted to tell one "young lady" to "sit down," and said it's "OK … [to] be skeptical about information." You are a climate denier," said the first demonstrator, as members of the audience booed and called for her to "sit down" and to "get her out of here." In an attempt to defuse the tense moment, Perry described the protester as "one of the more interesting EIA employees," prompting laughter from the audience. Undeterred, the protester kept shouting questions at Perry, who then told her: "If you'll sit down, young lady … I'll finish my remarks." Answer my question, why will you not say that climate change is caused by carbon dioxide?" she pressed. Perry was referring to remarks he made during an interview last week with CNBC "Squawk Box." Perry told host Joe Kernan that carbon dioxide was not "the primary control knob" for climate change. While man is "having an effect" on climate, he said, "most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in." His response is in stark contrast to overwhelming scientific consensus based on facts, which says human activity, specifically greenhouse gas emissions, is the primary driver of global warming. The American Meteorological Society skewered Perry for his comments, saying in a letter last week that he lacked a "fundamental understanding of the science" behind climate change. During his EIA conference speech on Tuesday, Perry was interrupted a second time by a protester, who also called him a "climate denier." I think it's OK for us to ask questions and be skeptical about information," Perry said in response, according to a E&E News report of the event.″[S]kepticism and debate are always welcome and are critically important to the advancement of science," the letter said. "In climate science unresolved questions remain ― issues that currently lack conclusive evidence. However, there are also very solid conclusions that are based on decades of research and multiple lines of evidence. Skepticism that fails to account for evidence is no virtue." Later on Tuesday, Perry was quizzed about climate change again during a White House press briefing, arranged as part of the Trump administration's "Energy Week." When asked if President Donald Trump believes in climate change, Perry responded "I have not had that conversation with him" ― joining a growing list of officials who have refused to comment on the commander in chief's position on this critical issue.

221	cbsnews	left_center_bias	2019-03-31	Judge strikes down Trump's offshore drilling decision President Trump exceeded his authority when he reversed bans on offshore drilling in vast parts of the Arctic Ocean and dozens of canyons in the Atlantic Ocean, a U.S. judge said in a ruling that restored the Obama-era restrictions. U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason in a decision late Friday threw out Mr. Trump's executive order that overturned the bans that comprised a key part of Obama's environmental legacy. Presidents have the power under a federal law to remove certain lands from development but cannot revoke those removals, Gleason said." The wording of President Obama's 2015 and 2016 withdrawals indicates that he intended them to extend indefinitely, and therefore be revocable only by an act of Congress," said Gleason, who was nominated to the bench by Obama. The American Petroleum Institute, a defendant in the case, disagreed with the ruling." In addition to bringing supplies of affordable energy to consumers for decades to come, developing our abundant offshore resources can provide billions in government revenue, create thousands of jobs and will also strengthen our national security," it said in a statement. Erik Grafe, an attorney with Earthjustice, welcomed the ruling, saying it "shows that the president cannot just trample on the Constitution to do the bidding of his cronies in the fossil fuel industry at the expense of our oceans, wildlife and climate." Earthjustice represented numerous environmental groups that sued the Trump administration over the April 2017 executive order reversing the drilling bans. At issue in the case was the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. Acting Assistant U.S. Attorney General Jeffrey Wood said during a hearing before Gleason in November that environmental groups were misinterpreting the intent of the law written in 1953. He said it is meant to be flexible and sensible and not intended to bind one president with decisions made by another when determining offshore stewardship as needs and realities change over time. In 2015, Mr. Obama halted exploration in coastal areas of the Beaufort and Chukchi seas and the Hanna Shoal, an important area for walrus. In late 2016, he withdrew most other potential Arctic Ocean lease areas - about 98 percent of the Arctic outer continental shelf. The bans were intended to protect polar bears, walruses, ice seals and Alaska Native villages that depend on the animals. In the Atlantic, Mr. Obama banned exploration in 5,937 square miles of underwater canyon complexes, citing their importance for marine mammals, deep-water corals, valuable fish populations and migratory whales.

The plan is meant to set the U.S. senator from California apart in a crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates by drawing on her experience prosecuting polluters as a California attorney general and district attorney. At the same time it is intended to assuage environmental activists worried that she has downplayed climate change on the campaign trail. All of the other top-tier presidential candidates have already detailed aggressive plans to eliminate U.S. greenhouse gas emissions within 10 to 30 years, tapping into what has become a crucial issue for Democratic voters." he wants to distinguish herself from other candidates that have already laid out climate plans with her own approach that plays to her strengths, focusing on environmental justice and enforcement," said one of the sources. Like the other candidates, Harris' plan will also likely target a swift end to fossil fuels use, though the details are still being drafted, the sources said. The campaign is expected to release the plan ahead of a climate change-focused town hall with the candidates on Sept. 4, they said.A spokeswoman for Harris' campaign, Kate Waters, declined to comment on the details but said Harris would be releasing something "soon." While activist groups say they are generally happy with Harris' environmental credentials, she has drawn their criticism since launching her presidential bid. Last week, for example, she came under fire from the Sunrise Movement and other climate change activists when she initially declined to participate in the televised Sept. 4 climate change town hall to attend a fundraiser. Her campaign later announced she had changed her plans and would attend. During campaign speeches, she tends to include a brief mention of climate change, calling it a real crisis and adding that she would re-engage the United States in global efforts to fight it if elected. Republican President Donald Trump has rolled back U.S. climate change rules he views as damaging to the economy, and announced plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate agreement, an international accord to limit global warming. Bahram Fazeli, director of research and policy for Communities for a Better Environment, a California-focused environmental justice group, said Harris' record on the environment was "decent." As a senator, Harris was among the original co-sponsors of the Green New Deal – a nonbinding congressional resolution to zero out U.S. emissions by 2030 – and introduced bills to denounce Trump's efforts to roll back California's vehicle emissions standards and drill for oil and natural gas in federal waters. She has also co-sponsored an environmental justice bill with Green New Deal author congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, which includes the creation of a federal office for environmental justice. Previously, as California's attorney general, Harris was charged with protecting the state's progressive environmental laws in the courts. Her biggest environmental victory, according to green groups, came in 2016 when a grand jury indicted Plains All-American Pipeline on criminal charges related to a 2015 oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara. She also reportedly launched an investigation in 2016 into whether Exxon Mobil lied to the public and shareholders about the risks of climate change, though her office never confirmed the probe. Since then both New York and Massachusetts have pursued cases against the oil company. Earlier, as district attorney for San Francisco, Harris also created the city's first environmental crimes unit.

The news comes as Donald Trump's Interior Department was in the process of delaying the regulation until 2019, calling it "too burdensome to the industry." More from the report via The Washington Post:The order by a judge in San Francisco came as the Interior Department moved to delay the rule until 2019, saying it was too burdensome to industry. The action followed an earlier effort by Interior to postpone part of the rule set to take effect next year. U.S. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Laporte of the Northern District of California said Interior had failed to give a "reasoned explanation" for the changes and had not offered details why an earlier analysis by the Obama administration was faulty. She ordered the entire rule reinstated immediately. As the U.S. Magistrate Judge Laporte noted in her ruling, the reason she called for the Obama-era rule to be reinstated right away is that the Trump administration cannot give a "reasoned explanation" as to why it's flawed. In a way, that cuts to the heart of everything this administration has done so far when it comes to environmental policy. After all, there is no reasonable explanation for anything this president has done when it comes to the environment, whether it's allowing toxic sludge to be dumped in our waterways or pulling out of the historic Paris climate accord. While the previous administration let science and data drive its climate agenda, the Trump administration has had one goal in mind: destroying former President Obama's environmental legacy. On Wednesday, one federal judge reminded Donald Trump that hating Barack Obama is not a good enough reason to ignore key environmental protections.	True	False	True	False	False
294	breitbart	questionable_source	2019-10-09	Elizabeth Warren Touts Plan to Address 'Environmental Racism' Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Wednesday unveiled her plan to address "environmental injustice" and "environmental racism," which includes a $1 trillion investment into minority communities affected by "industrial pollution." Warren argues that "justice" plays a massive role in properly addressing the climate change "crisis," citing studies that suggest that black and Hispanic families are disproportionately affected by air pollution caused by white people:Warren calls this phenomenon "environmental racism" and concludes that "environmental injustice is the result of decades of discrimination and environmental racism compounding in communities that have been overlooked for too long." She previewed her plan in a video clip featuring far-left "Squad" member Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI)." e need a government that's on the side of families—not giant corporations polluting our communities. @RashidaTlaib and I walked through 48217, the most polluted zip code in Michigan, and talked with the families living every day with the effects of pollution," Warren tweeted alongside the clip:Like Warren's other proposals, her environmental injustice plan weaves in aspects of her other campaign promises. For instance, Warren says her housing plan will provide an assistance program, aimed to get impoverished families out of poor, pollution-ridden neighborhoods and into the "neighborhood of their choice." She also pledges to invest one-third – or $1 trillion – of her climate change investment "into the most vulnerable communities," although she does not specify what the $1 trillion will be spent on, specifically. Like most of Warren's plans, her environmental injustice proposal involves the implementation of another tax. In this instance, it is the "Superfund Waste Tax." There are over 1300 remaining Superfund sites across the country, many located in or adjacent to frontline communities. So-called "orphan" toxic waste clean-ups were originally funded by a series of excise taxes on the petroleum and chemical industries. But thanks to Big Oil and other industry lobbyists, when that tax authority expired in 1995 it was not renewed. Polluters must pay for the consequences of their actions – not leave them for the communities to clean up. I'll work with Congress to reinstate and then triple the Superfund tax, generating needed revenue to clean up the mess. The presidential hopeful even weaves in Medicare for All as part of her broader proposal, arguing such a system will "make it easier for the federal government to quickly tailor health care responses to specific environmental disasters in affected communities when they occur." Warren also reiterates her pledge to "ensure that employers and our government honor the promises they made to workers in fossil fuel industries." I've fought for years to protect pensions and health benefits for retired coal workers, and I'll continue fighting to maintain the solvency of multi-employer pension plans," she said. "As president, I'll protect those benefits that fossil fuel workers have earned." However, Warren's role in crafting a petition to the Supreme Court on behalf of LTV Steel – which helped the company's "fight against a congressional requirement that it pay millions of dollars into a fund for its retired coal miners' health care" – calls her promise into question." s I've traveled this country, I've heard the human stories from frontline communities. Families where many people have cancer. Coastal communities facing the threat of rising sea levels. Ruined land and poisoned water," Warren tweeted." hese communities need justice—and I will stand with them," she added:	True	False	False	False	True
802	PBS	left_center_bias	2017-10-09	EPA chief says White House to roll back Obama-era clean power plan HAZARD, Ky. — The head of the Environmental Protection Agency said Monday that he will sign a new rule overriding the Clean Power Plan, an Obama-era effort to limit carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants." he war on coal is over," EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt declared in the coal mining state of Kentucky. For Pruitt, getting rid of the Clean Power Plan will mark the culmination of a long fight he began as the elected attorney general of Oklahoma. Pruitt was among about two-dozen attorney generals who sued to stop President Barack Obama's push to limit carbon emissions. Closely tied to the oil and gas industry in his home state, Pruitt rejects the consensus of scientists that man-man emissions from burning fossil fuels are the primary driver of global climate change. President Donald Trump, who appointed Pruitt and shares his skepticism of established climate science, promised to kill the Clean Power Plan during the 2016 campaign as part of his broader pledge to revive the nation's struggling coal mines. In his order Tuesday, Pruitt is expected to declare that the Obama-era rule exceeded federal law by setting emissions standards that power plants could not reasonably meet. Appearing at an event with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Pruitt said, "The EPA and no federal agency should ever use its authority to say to you we are going to declare war on any sector of our economy." Obama's plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions. The Supreme Court put the plan on hold last year following legal challenges by industry and coal-friendly states. Even so, the plan helped drive a recent wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power, as well as state mandates promoting energy conservation. The withdrawal of the Clean Power Plan is the latest in a series of moves by Trump and Pruitt to dismantle Obama's legacy on fighting climate change, including the delay or roll back of rules limiting levels of toxic pollution in smokestack emissions and wastewater discharges from coal-burning power plants. The president announced earlier this year that he will pull the United States out of the landmark Paris climate agreement. Nearly 200 countries have committed to combat global warming by reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. Associated Press writer Michael Biesecker contributed to this report from Washington.	False	False	False	False	False
469	thehuffingtonpost	left_bias	2018-08-06	Trump Accuses California Of Causing Wildfires By 'Diverting' Water To Pacific As California wildfires claimed their seventh victim, Donald Trump finally weighed in on the tragedy with one of his most confounding tweets ever, blaming California for the blazes because it "diverts" water to the Pacific Ocean. He also blamed the state's "bad environmental laws" — the most protective in the nation — and trees. He called for a "tree clear to stop fire spreading." He failed to express condolences to the families of the victims, thank firefighters, or offer comfort to Californians afraid for their lives, homes and communities. California wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren't allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized. It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire spreading! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 5, 2018The tweet came just days after the Trump administration moved to scrap tough vehicle emissions standards — initially established by California. The move would clear the way for vehicles to pump an additional 600 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere by 2030. That's the equivalent of the entire annual emissions of Canada. It's unclear what the president meant by water "diverted" into the Pacific. California allocates water among residents, agricultural and industrial use, and for wetlands and wildlife, including water mandated to protect endangered species. But state waters eventually drain into the ocean. As one tweeter responded: "Water running into the Pacific Ocean is called a river." And firefighters haven't complained of a lack of water for battling the blazes. The tweet could be a muddled indication of support for a GOP battle in Washington for a larger water allocation to farmers, many of them Republican voters, in the drought-stricken state's central valley.  But it's unclear how that would help staunch California fires. The scientific consensus is that fires are becoming more common because of climate change, which Trump once called a Chinese "hoax." Twitter users were stunned the president failed to express concern about people suffering in the fires. But most readers were stumped — or derisive. One responded: "Thanks, genius. Problem solved." As a professor who specializes in wildfire management, there are a lot of things that are broken about how we prepare for & fight wildfires... but it's near impossible to overstate how ridiculous this comment is.  — Eric Kennedy (@ericbkennedy) August 5, 2018I had to come look if this was a real tweet. Ummmmm.... gee..... You seem to know next to nothing about California. Fires are more often fought with flame retardant. Mowing down a forest to keep the forest from burning is on the crazy side. — bree brinkenstein👻❄ (@eebrinkenstein) August 6, 2018Thank you for your heartfelt words of concern and support for the families who have lost everything. — Primrose Lane (@ridiculoustimes) August 6, 2018No you #StableGenius, scientists have been seeing the fingerprints of #climatechange all over these fires and it's making them far worse.

739	PBS	left_center_bias	2017-09-21	How will climate change impact future floods and flood insurance? Editor's note: Radley Horton is a professor at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, where he studies climate extremes, impacts and adaptation. He spoke with NewsHour economics correspondent Paul Solman for Thursday's Making Sen$e segment on flood insurance. The following excerpt of their interview has been edited for length and clarity. Paul Solman: How certain are we, or can we be, that these storms and the flooding associated with them is a function of climate change?Radley Horton: There are many components to these storms. And, depending on what part we're talking about, the certainty differs. There are some aspects that are really a sure thing. For example, we know that sea levels are rising. We know that's going to continue. And even if storms don't change at all, just by virtue of raising that baseline, raising that floor, we're going to see more frequent and more severe coastal flooding. But, when we look at some of the really fundamental aspects of a storm itself, there's more uncertainty. The balance of evidence suggests that the strongest storms will become stronger, with stronger winds, more storm surge, as the planet warms, and as the upper oceans warm. But we can't say it's a sure thing. PS: What about the larger cycles of the planet? Don't they override, or mightn't they override, the kinds of things we as human beings are doing in the short term?RH: There are many things that can impact the climate, for sure. But right now, during this era that we're living in, human activities and the burning of fossil fuels is, by far, the most powerful influence. Just since the start of the industrial revolution, we've increased the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by about 40 percent. It's already caused sea levels to rise, close to a foot in many places along the U.S. coast. So that's increasing the risk of these types of storms. WATCH: Less than half of Florida homeowners have flood insurancePS: Can't we mitigate the effects of flooding? I mean, that's what they're doing, raising houses all over the coastline in the United States, and [countries like] Holland. RH: The types of mitigation efforts you're talking about are critical. This is what we often hear referred to as 'resilience' or 'adapting' to a changing climate. And that has to be a key component of all strategies. We absolutely do need to strengthen that infrastructure, whether it's elevating buildings, green infrastructure that can capture some of these excess water. We need those strategies. But you start to wonder, at what point have things changed too much for us to be able to adapt to? For example, if you look at parts of South Florida, as sea levels rise, as the water table rises, no matter how much money you put into trying to build sea walls, that water is just going to make its way up, like Swiss cheese through some of that limestone. You can't hold the water back. PS: So what would you advise somebody who lives in a floodplain? Should they just get out? [Because] many can't, economically, right? Or do they jack up their houses? Is that the best approach?RH: If you live in a flood zone, certainly you should be thinking about climate change. That's one of the dimensions. But there are a lot of other factors that impact vulnerability as well. When people were assessing the risk originally and defining the flood zones, they [made estimates] based on 10, 20 years of rainfall data. [That's] an insufficiently long sample to really estimate the true one-in-a-hundred-year risk. Another concern is that, since that home was built, there may have been changes in development in surrounding areas. If you look at what happened in Houston recently, so much of the natural area had been covered up with pavement. That changes the flood risk. [But when it comes to] the climate change piece, and if we're talking about homes that are in coastal zones, sea level rise is a game changer. PS: When the federal government redraws a map in a place like Pequannock, New Jersey, and includes more and more houses, hundreds more houses, in the floodplain, is the government potentially overreacting?RH: The government is trying to update using the latest available information. More years of weather data are now available, and there've been changes in the land use in some of these regions as well, that impact the path that that water takes. PS: Has flood insurance basically induced people to take risks that they shouldn't be taking?RH: Quite possibly. That's why we need a much deeper discussion, both about those properties that currently are insured, and about uninsured properties, and about properties that, as the climate changes, are going to be moving into newly defined flood zones. [In the future], we could see property values fall, not because water touches or doesn't touch some of these homes, but because of systemic risk, the inability of insurance to cover all these assets, or investors finally realizing that a lot of critical infrastructure isn't going to be fundable.

At a closing press conference before departing the summit, Trump was asked whether he still harbors skepticism about climate change. He did not directly answer, saying he is an "environmentalist" but that he is unwilling to sacrifice the country's economic success to protect the environment."I'm an environmentalist. A lot of people don't understand that," Trump said, citing his experience filing environmental impact statements for real estate developments."I think I know more about the environment than most people," he added. "I want clean air. I want clean water. I want a wealthy country. I want a spectacular country with jobs, with pensions, with so many things. And that's what we're getting." At the same time, it's very important to me ... we have to maintain this incredible place that we've all built," Trump continued. The U.S. has "become a much richer country. And that's a good thing, not a bad thing. Because that wealth allows us to take care of people." Earlier Monday, the president skipped a G-7 session focused on climate and sent another administration official in his place. The heads of government of the other six nations that comprise the G-7 were there. During the climate meeting, leaders approved a $20 million aid package to help Brazil and other South American countries address fires engulfing the Amazon rainforest, French President Emmanuel Macron Emmanuel Jean-Michel MacronTrump says he's 'an environmentalist' after skipping G-7 climate meeting Trump says he'd meet with Iranians under 'right' circumstances Macron: US, France reached 'very good agreement' on digital tax MORE said. Trump has in the past characterized climate change as a hoax, mocked the idea of global warming by citing winter storms and cast doubt on government reports warning about how the changing environment might adversely affect the economy. His administration has rolled back a number of environmental protections enacted by the Obama administration, and Trump announced shortly after taking office that he would withdraw from the Paris climate agreement that seeks to combat global emissions. The president on Monday cited the expansion of energy exports under his administration and the opening of drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as ways he has made the country more prosperous."I'm not going to lose that wealth," he said. "I'm not going to lose that on dreams. On windmills."	True	False	True	False	True
375	thedailycaller	right_bias	2018-08-06	Trump Says 'Bad Environmental Laws' Made Deadly California Wildfires Even Worse President Donald Trump blamed "bad environmental laws" for making wildfires spreading across California "much worse," in a Sunday tweet. Trump wrote these laws "aren't allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized," which is instead "being diverted into the Pacific Ocean. Must also tree clear to stop fire spreading!"Persistent heat, dry condition and winds have fueled several major wildfires across California, the biggest of which is the Carr Fire that's scorched more than 140,000 acres and killed seven people. (RELATED: NYT Claims 'Global Greening' From CO2 Is 'Terrible,' Gets Owned)State officials said the Carr Fire was sparked in late July by a flat tire on a trailer scraping against the asphalt on a road near Redding, California. California Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, blamed man-made global warming for the state's rash of intense fires in the last couple of years, however, wildfire experts and conservatives tend to blame poor land management policies coupled with the expansion of human development into fire-prone areas. That's likely what Trump is referring to when he tweeted "[m]ust also tree clear to stop fire spreading!" Thinning of trees and removing of dead vegetation and brush can help mitigate wildfires. What's not a clear link to wildfires, however, is Trump's referral to California water supplies being diverted into the ocean. He's likely referring to the diverting of water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta into the ocean to protect the delta smelt, an endangered fish. Republicans and farmers have complained about management of the smelt population for years because precious water was being pumped out to sea instead of going towards other uses, including agriculture. Those concerns were magnified during the recent multi-year drought, and recent population surveys show fresh water diversion has not been enough to keep smelt populations from declining. However, it's unclear how diverting water into the Pacific Ocean affects wildfires in California. Trump also lambasted policies forcing river water to be diverted during the 2016 campaign." s there a drought?" Trump said at a rally in Fresno that year. "No, we have plenty of water," adding "[w]e shove it out to sea." Trump approved disaster declarations for the Carr Fire, making it easier for state and federal officials to share resources and coordinate a response.	False	False	True	False	False
650	Drudge Report	right_bias	2017-08-14	Scientists discover 91 volcanoes below Antarctic ice sheet... Scientists have uncovered the largest volcanic region on Earth – two kilometres below the surface of the vast ice sheet that covers west Antarctica. The project, by Edinburgh University researchers, has revealed almost 100 volcanoes – with the highest as tall as the Eiger, which stands at almost 4,000 metres in Switzerland. Geologists say this huge region is likely to dwarf that of east Africa's volcanic ridge, currently rated the densest concentration of volcanoes in the world. And the activity of this range could have worrying consequences, they have warned. "If one of these volcanoes were to erupt it could further destabilise west Antarctica's ice sheets," said glacier expert Robert Bingham, one of the paper's authors. "Anything that causes the melting of ice – which an eruption certainly would – is likely to speed up the flow of ice into the sea." he big question is: how active are these volcanoes? That is something we need to determine as quickly as possible." The Edinburgh volcano survey, reported in the Geological Society's special publications series, involved studying the underside of the west Antarctica ice sheet for hidden peaks of basalt rock similar to those produced by the region's other volcanoes. Their tips actually lie above the ice and have been spotted by polar explorers over the past century. But how many lie below the ice? This question was originally asked by the team's youngest member, Max Van Wyk de Vries, an undergraduate at the university's school of geosciences and a self-confessed volcano fanatic. He set up the project with the help of Bingham. Their study involved analysing measurements made by previous surveys, which involved the use of ice-penetrating radar, carried either by planes or land vehicles, to survey strips of the west Antarctic ice. The results were then compared with satellite and database records and geological information from other aerial surveys. "Essentially, we were looking for evidence of volcanic cones sticking up into the ice," Bingham said. After the team had collated the results, it reported a staggering 91 previously unknown volcanoes, adding to the 47 others that had been discovered over the previous century of exploring the region. These newly discovered volcanoes range in height from 100 to 3,850 metres. All are covered in ice, which sometimes lies in layers that are more than 4km thick in the region. These active peaks are concentrated in a region known as the west Antarctic rift system, which stretches 3,500km from Antarctica's Ross ice shelf to the Antarctic peninsula." e were amazed," Bingham said. "We had not expected to find anything like that number. We have almost trebled the number of volcanoes known to exist in west Antarctica. We also suspect there are even more on the bed of the sea that lies under the Ross ice shelf, so that I think it is very likely this region will turn out to be the densest region of volcanoes in the world, greater even than east Africa, where mounts Nyiragongo, Kilimanjaro, Longonot and all the other active volcanoes are concentrated." The discovery is particularly important because the activity of these volcanoes could have crucial implications for the rest of the planet. If one erupts, it could further destabilise some of the region's ice sheets, which have already been affected by global warming. Meltwater outflows into the Antarctic ocean could trigger sea level rises. "We just don't know about how active these volcanoes have been in the past," Bingham said. However, he pointed to one alarming trend: "The most volcanism that is going in the world at present is in regions that have only recently lost their glacier covering – after the end of the last ice age. These places include Iceland and Alaska." heory suggests that this is occurring because, without ice sheets on top of them, there is a release of pressure on the regions' volcanoes and they become more active." And this could happen in west Antarctica, where significant warming in the region caused by climate change has begun to affect its ice sheets. If they are reduced significantly, this could release pressure on the volcanoes that lie below and lead to eruptions that could further destabilise the ice sheets and enhance sea level rises that are already affecting our oceans." t is something we will have to watch closely," Bingham said.

Thomas Massey who claims to be an electrical engineer, but he doesn't understand climate change. And the guy that I saw the other day, if I may take a moment — was congressman Thomas Massey from Kentucky, and he is an electrical engineer. He says on his website he claims to be an inventor and he acted as though he cannot grasp this he focused on the idea that 800,000 years ago there was a higher level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere than there is today, and how do we know that? By looking at the ice cores or the ancient atmospheres in the ancient ice. I presume you don't watch MSNBC…A member of his staff might. That's what I'm hoping for. I'm hoping for. So congressman or the congressman's staff, here's the hockey stick graph that you guys love to go off that's been debunked. No, it hasn't been debunked. It's a fact. If you're really an electrical engineer, here's the problem. The rate of global warming, if it was even detectable at this scale with about .1 degrees celsius every thousand or maybe even every 10,000 years. Now it's that .1 degree Celsius every decade. So congressman, it's like this in calculus terms. The rate of temperature getting bigger is very high. This would be dT, dt where capital "T," is temperature and, and the lower case is time, or congressman's staff if out there, that's the problem. This looks like an exaggerated hockey stick because it is. It's the speed. The Trump administration recently called a science a "Democrat thing," so no one should expect the Republican Party to get won over into believing facts again, but Bill Nye laid it all out nice and easy. The temperature is rising quickly. It is a race against time, and the longer that Republicans deny and delay, the worse it will be for our planet, our people, and our future.

188	usatoday	left_center_bias	2019-08-28	Amazon fires: Respiratory problems spike, kids affected the most PORTO VELHO, Brazil – Lingering smoke in the Amazon caused concern Tuesday among Brazilians who say that respiratory problems – particularly among children and the elderly – have increased as fires in the region rage." he kids are affected the most. They're coughing a lot," said Elane Diaz, a nurse in the Rondonia state capital of Porto Velho, as she waited for a doctor's appointment at the city's 9 of July hospital with her 5-year-old-son Eduardo. "They have problems breathing. I'm concerned because it affects their health." The number of people treated for respiratory issues increased sharply in recent days at the local Cosme e Damia Children's hospital." his period has been very tough. The dry weather and the smoke causes many problems on children, such as pneumonia, coughing and secretion," Daniel Pires, a pediatrician and the hospital's adjunct-director told the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper. "From Aug. 1 to Aug. 10, the median (number) of cases was about 120 to 130 children with respiratory problems. From Aug. 11 to (Aug. 20) it went up to 280 cases." Amazon fires: What would the Earth be like without the Amazon rainforest?Growing fears over the health impacts are emerging as the number of fires in Brazil surges, with more than 77,000 documented by the country's National Space Research Institute in the last year. About half of the fires occurred in the Amazon region, with most in the past month. But as breathing-related ailments appear to be on the rise, attention to the issue has largely been overshadowed by growing acrimony between Brazil and European countries seeking to help fight Amazon fires and protect a region seen as vital to the health of the planet. At a summit in France this week, G-7 nations pledged to help fight the flames and protect the rainforest by offering $20 million, in addition to a separate $12 million from Britain and $11 million from Canada. But Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right climate skeptic who took office this year with a promise to boost development in Latin America's biggest economy, questioned whether offers of international aid mask a plot to exploit the Amazon's resources and weaken Brazilian growth. On Tuesday, he said that his French counterpart President Emmanuel Macron had called him a liar and would have to apologize before Brazil considers accepting rainforest aid. Macron has to retract those comments "and then we can speak," Bolsonaro said. In a video message, Brazilian novelist Paulo Coelho offered an apology to France for what he called Bolsonaro's "hysteria," saying the Brazilian government had resorted to insults to dodge responsibility for the Amazon fires. Meanwhile, within Brazil, a number of people said they supported Bolsonaro despite local and international criticism of his handling of the crisis, exposing a divide that has split the country. Grace Quale, a hospital laboratory technician who attended a service at an evangelical church on Sunday, said that critics "want to overthrow our president," and that she didn't see a link between Bolsonaro's environmental policies and the number of people getting treatment for respiratory problems. Mona Lisa Pereira, an agronomist, also said criticism of Brazil's government was skewed." ermany had already been helping through NGOs and they couldn't prevent this," Pereira said. "It seems like this is the fire of a lifetime. But it's not. We have fires every year." Others said in an open letter that the government's discourse and measures are leading to a "collapse in federal environmental management and stimulate environmental crimes inside and outside the Amazon." More than 500 employees from the environmental regulator IBAMA signed the letter and included a list of emergency measures they recommended, including more qualified management and employees, and a greater budget and increased autonomy. The Amazon has experienced an increased rate of fires during drought periods in the last 20 years, but the phenomenon this year is "unusual" because drought has not yet hit, said Laura Schneider of Rutgers University-New Brunswick. Schneider, an associate professor in the geography department, said fire is commonly used by people to clear land for cultivation, and the actual area burned this year must be measured for an accurate comparison with damage in past years. While many of the recorded fires this year were set in already deforested areas by people clearing land for cultivation or pasture, Brazil government figures show that they are much more widespread this year, suggesting the threat to the vast Amazon ecosystem is intensifying. But for now, more immediate consequences of the raging flames were becoming clear. The world's largest rainforest is a major absorber of carbon dioxide, considered a critical defense against rising temperatures and other disruptions caused by climate change. The government in the Amazonian state of Rondonia has warned that the burning of land can produce smoke that can "greatly influence atmospheric pollution, putting the life of many at risk." Experts there said that when exposed to smoke, residents can suffer from rhinitis, sinus and respiratory problems like asthma and bronchitis, while chronic exposure can also lead to pulmonary illnesses, including lung emphysema." e've seen that (Porto Velho) has been taken over by smoke, so inhaling those antigens and pathogens can harm the whole city's population," Ana Carolina Terra Cruz, a specialist in pulmonary illnesses, told the state government website. Deep ramifications: Trump would cost General Motors billions if he actually orders business out of ChinaOn Tuesday, some clouds and a blue sky were partly visible in the Porto Velho morning light. But by the afternoon, haze had again settled, with smoke so thick that it darkened the usually blazing sun. Pereira, the agronomist, said that smoke was "everywhere." It's bad for everyone," she said. "Not just our children."	True	False	True	False	True
134	thehuffingtonpost	left_bias	2019-09-18	10,000 Farmers And Ranchers Endorse Green New Deal In Letter To Congress Nearly 10,000 farmers and ranchers are endorsing the Green New Deal as the climate policy battleground expands from the oil fields to the agricultural fields. In a letter sent to Congress on Wednesday morning, the newly formed bipartisan coalition U.S. Farmers & Ranchers for a Green New Deal threw its weight behind the sweeping industrial plan outlined in a resolution that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) proposed in February. But zeroing out the country's planet-heating emissions by mid-century requires a transformation in agriculture as dramatic as shifting the energy sector away from fossil fuels, the letter says." e believe these climate goals are achievable," the letter argues, "but only if the GND includes policies that spur two large-scale transitions: the transition away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy alternatives, and the transition away from industrial agriculture toward family farm-based organic and regenerative farming and land-use practices that improve soil health and draw down and sequester carbon." The letter was signed by more than 500 individual farms and 50 organizations representing close to 10,000 members. Regeneration International, a sustainable farming nonprofit, organized the missive with the climate justice group Sunrise Movement. It also hosted a Wednesday morning press conference in Washington.A month ago, the United Nations released a dire new report urging major changes to food production and land management and warning that emissions cuts alone will fall short of halting catastrophic global warming. Taking cues from those pushing for a Green New Deal, several Democratic presidential hopefuls have made farming practices central to their climate proposals. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) earmarked $410 billion in his Green New Deal proposal to help "farms of all sizes transition to ecologically regenerative agricultural practices." Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called for breaking up agriculture monopolies as part of her broad rural platform. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg vowed to "support farmers" by "paying them to capture carbon." Yet even as farmers reel from the effects of President Donald Trump's trade war with China, Democratic candidates are far from guaranteed their votes. Farmers supported the Trump administration's proposal last week to finalize the rollback of the Obama-era Waters of the U.S. rule, which had put new restrictions on which waterways agribusiness could pollute. Early on, Republican opposition to the Green New Deal itself coalesced around the idea that such a program would ban beef production, although supporters have clearly said it would not." e call on Congress to put the 'Green' in the Green New Deal," Wednesday's letter reads, "by empowering us to revitalize the health and economic security of this country's middle class, to make family farming economically viable again, and to help reverse climate change and improve America's air and water quality by making our ecosystems healthy again."

697	Politicus USA	left_bias	2017-04-08	California governor declares end to drought emergency LOS ANGELES (Reuters) – One of the worst droughts in California history has officially ended, Governor Jerry Brown declared, but not before it strained the state's farm economy and threatened water supplies for millions of residents. Months of drenching storms and melting snowpack have replenished reservoirs, which began drying up in late 2011. That allowed Brown to lift most stipulations of an emergency order he implemented in January 2014, about two years after the conditions crossed the line into drought. Brown also said the need for conservation continued. Officials will still require some long-term water-use limits imposed last year and are developing water preservation standards for urban agencies." his drought emergency is over, but the next drought could be around the corner," Brown said in a statement. "Conservation must remain a way of life." The drought cost the agricultural economy billions, killed an estimated 100 million trees, led a half-million acres of farmland to be fallowed and deprived some communities of reliable sources of drinking water. In April 2015, when the state's snowpack hit its lowest since 1950 at 5 percent of its historic average, Brown stood on a dry mountain that was normally blanketed in snow at that time of year and ordered urban areas to reduce water use by 25 percent. As of last week, the snowpack stood at 150 percent of normal. The 2015 order led environmentalists to complain that the state, which leads the nation in production of fruits and vegetables, did too little to force farmers to conserve water. For their part, farmers said they received far less water than promised by state and federal authorities. On Friday, the Democratic governor lifted the drought declaration in all counties except four, mostly in the state's agricultural Central Valley." t's worth taking a moment to be grateful for all the rain and snow out there," Felicia Marcus, chair of the State Water Resources Control Board, told reporters on a conference call after the governor's announcement. California officials have credited residents for doing their part to conserve water by taking shorter showers and ripping out grass lawns to install landscaping that requires minimal irrigation, among other measures. Even though the drought is officially over, groundwater supplies remain below normal, the Natural Resources Defense Council cautioned in a statement." ear after year, California continues to use more water than is made available by nature," Kate Poole, director of the group's water and wildlife project, said in a statement.

689	CNN	left_bias	2017-04-22	Climate scientists, officials dismayed over Trump's stance This week, President Donald Trump was to meet with senior administration officials to discuss the deal -- and whether the United States should withdraw from it. The meeting was postponed indefinitely, and with key Trump advisers divided over the issue, it is still uncertain what Trump will finally do about the accord. But advocates of greater federal regulations to address climate change are already expressing dismay about the administration's stance. It's no secret that Trump has called climate change a "hoax" in the past. Last month, he signed an executive order rolling back Obama-era climate regulations, which will initiate a review of the Clean Power Plan, an effort to cut carbon dioxide emissions that Obama started. And Trump's pick to run the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, has made it clear addressing climate change will not be an urgent priority for the agency under his watch, declining to say after his confirmation whether he would forbid EPA scientists from studying the human connection to the issue." We have many priorities at the agency. We must focus on those," he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room" in February, rattling off other needs, such as improving air quality. He declined to answer repeated questions as to whether he would "allow" climate-change research. "It's a shame for us to lose our leadership position," said Christine Todd Whitman, the EPA administrator during the George W. Bush administration. "We are an extraordinarily innovative, capable nation. We can come up with better ways to provide power to people and still keep jobs. This idea that environmental protection and economic growth are contrary are just wrong, and we've proven that over the years as we have reduced the pollutants in the air, increased the population, increased our energy demand and watched our GDP more than double." "We've seen we can do this," Whitman continued. "We've done it in the past; we can do it again. We can't have a thriving economy if you don't have a healthy, clean environment." Adam Koniuszewski, project leader of the Gorbachev Climate Change Task Force, a think tank that focuses on global challenges posed by climate change, agreed with Whitman. "President Trump has an America First policy," he said. "But in terms of climate leadership, it is exactly the opposite. Promoting a coal- or fossil-fuel-based economy will, in reality, leave America last in terms of a low-carbon economy in the 21st century. China is already taking the lead when it comes to renewable energy -- both solar and wind power. America must look forward to and innovate for 21st century solutions. An emphasis on coal and the energy sources that propelled the industrial revolution is like returning to the Stone Age." Trump's executive order also lifts the moratorium on coal mining on federal lands, something that William Becker, executive director of the Presidential Climate Action Project called a "cruel political stunt" designed to rally the support of coal miners, but which won't bring back many jobs. "What we need to do is make sure the transition to clean energy, which is inevitable, is a just and fair transition, one that helps coal-dependent communities and workers make transitions into other kinds of jobs," Becker said. "There's plenty to do out there, including environmental restoration positions," he said. "Coal jobs are not going to come back. There may be a little surge in them, but not much. It's technology or mechanization that's cost most of the jobs this past century in the coal industry. And now, of course, it's coal's inability to compete with natural gas on price for power generation. The market conditions are what's causing the coal industry to decline, and there's not much the President can do to reverse that trend." Trump has proposed massive cuts at the EPA, which Whitman believes is going to imperil its mission going forward. "The EPA can't survive with 31% cuts to the budget," she said. "That's going to really make it impossible for the agency to continue its mission, which is to protect public health and the environment."	False	False	True	False	True
21	redstate	right_bias	2019-02-05	Here's the Outrageous Cost of Ocasio-Cortez's "Green New Deal" Freshman Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has some lofty goals for herself and for America, with the benefits definitely more geared to benefit her. Meanwhile, her plans for us are incredibly costly, and not just because she's pushing a failed economic system for us to operate under. Ocasio-Cortez's "Green New Deal," as Fox News highlighted on Tuesday, is unprecedentedly expensive. The plan involves completely removing any and all uses of fossil fuels within America and moving to 100 percent renewable energy. The New York Democrat says the plan will take ten years. The cost of this ten-year plan? $7 trillion. As I've highlighted previously, the plan is beyond bad. Not only would it indebt us to Russia and China who hold the vast majority of the rare-earth materials needed to build the tidal wave of renewable energy devices we'd need to keep up with the nation's energy needs, but the wind farms, tidal generators, and solar farms have proven to be more deadly to the environment than oil spills. Hundreds of thousands of birds, many of them protected species, die at the hands of wind turbines yearly. Tidal generators beach whales with such frequency that if it were a Republican-backed project, environmental groups would be having conniption fits and endless marches. Still, Ocasio-Cortez believes that if this plan gets put into action it'll solve every problem under the sun, including racism and bigotry. What's more, the young democratic socialist proclaims that if we don't do it then we're all going to die in 12 years. When pie-in-the-sky thinking meets end-of-times conspiracy theories we get something like this. A scenario where we're all going to die unless we do exactly the thing some brave Democrat has proposed. All we have to do is give up our common sense.	False	False	True	False	True
532	cbsnews	left_center_bias	2018-08-17	After denying link, interior secretary says climate change impacts wildfires Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke suggested that climate change may have a role in the recent wildfires that have ravaged California. When asked by CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang whether he accepted that climate change was part of the problem, Zinke said "of course." He also acknowledged that "temperatures are rising." However, Zinke also reiterated an argument that he made earlier this week, blaming environmental groups for preventing dead trees from being cleared due to their opposition to the logging industry." The only endangered species happens to be a logger," Zinke said. Earlier this week, Zinke blamed "environmental terrorist groups" for California's destructive wildfires in an interview with Breitbart Radio." We have been held hostage by these environmental terrorist groups that have not allowed public access -- that have refused to allow [the] harvest of timber," Zinke told Breitbart Monday. On Sunday, Zinke said that the wildfires had "nothing to do with climate change" in an interview with local news station KCRA-TV. He suggested that environmental groups had prevented timber salvage operations, meaning that forests could not be cleared of flammable detritus."I've heard the climate change argument back and forth. This has nothing to do with climate change. This has to do with active forest management," Zinke said. President Trump tweeted earlier in August that California wildfires were made "so much worse" by "bad environmental laws," and called for clearing trees to prevent fires. The Mendocino Complex Fire north of San Francisco is the largest wildfire in state history and has scorched over 400 square miles. More than 14,000 firefighters are responding to over a dozen major blazes throughout California.	False	False	True	False	False
367	nationalreview	right_bias	2018-03-28	Energy Companies Sued for Being Energy Companies Lawsuits are a poor way to make the tradeoff between abundant energy and environmental harm. Numerous jurisdictions are suing energy companies. Not for fraud or white-collar crime, but for the effects of climate change. Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York, recently added his city to the list — and also started to divest the city's pension funds from fossil-fuel companies. But the phenomenon is primarily a California-centric one. In an address at SXSW earlier this month, even Arnold Schwarzenegger joined the fray. Presumably, this will soon be a cause célèbre. But it is unlikely to succeed, and lawsuits are a poor way to address the environmental harms of energy production anyhow. As David Bookbinder at the Niskanen Center notes, while all of the complaints are grounded in the energy companies' alleged accountability for rising sea levels, they fall into two essential categories. San Francisco and Oakland allege "public nuisance," and are suing to win compensation for that nuisance. This is the usual category for environmental-harm suits, the same legal theory by which localities have sued over lead pollution, water pollution, and the like. It was also the basis for the successful legal action taken against lead-paint producers in the same area. According to Bookbinder the claim "simply requires demonstrating that the defendant contributed to a condition that constitutes an unreasonable interference with public rights." The other plaintiffs — namely, San Mateo County, Marin County, and Imperial Beach — are employing a much more scattershot strategy, not only in the number of defendants that they name (nearly 40), but in alleging "design defect, failure to warn, negligence, and trespass" in addition to public nuisance. This approach gives juries multiple routes to a ruling against the energy companies, but it could backfire, with so many claims being made against such a wide variety of defendants that none of the blows really land. So what's the problem? The Union of Concerned Scientists, the activist group that has spearheaded this push for legal action, has compared energy companies' behavior with that of tobacco companies decades ago. The comparison reveals two fundamental issues with the suits. First, unlike smoking, energy is a basic good. Some form of energy is necessary to do just about anything, including to meet essential needs such as heating or cooling a home (which in some places is a genuine safety issue). There is an inherent tradeoff between affordable energy and environmental harm, and it makes no sense to ask judges and juries rather than elected legislators to strike the right balance. Second, a key allegation against cigarette companies was that they hid and denied the harms of smoking, but the parallel allegations against the energy companies are contradictory. We are expected to believe that energy companies covered up the damage done by fossil fuels — and yet publicly available, industry-funded research is cited as evidence that the companies were aware of the harms they were causing. For instance, San Mateo County's lawsuit notes that Exxon made its climate findings public in peer-reviewed science journals by 1982. Another obstacle is the fact that energy companies have government-granted permits to do what they do, a fact that some courts have found highly relevant. In North Carolina v. Tennessee Valley Authority, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit dismissed a common-law nuisance action on the grounds that "there is a distinction between an activity that is merely not illegal versus one that is explicitly granted a permit to operate in a particular fashion." The opinion further notes, citing New England Legal Foundation v. Costle, that "courts traditionally have been reluctant to enjoin as a public nuisance activities which have been considered and specifically authorized by the government." Local lawsuits also struggle to address the global scope of the climate-change problem. According to a study that is often drawn upon to make the case for liability, the two largest contributors to the rise in CO2 emissions since 1980 are Saudi Aramco and Gazprom: the state-owned oil companies of Saudi Arabia and Russia. The initial San Mateo suit did name Statoil, a company majority-owned by the Norwegian government, as a defendant, but even this was dropped in an effort to keep the case in state, as opposed to federal, court. As the eminent legal scholar Richard Epstein puts it, "If you're going to need a system of regulation, you can do that in a thousand different ways, but erratic, independent lawsuits in separate courts by separate people is the wrong way to go." This approach is likely to cause backlash that derails real, sustainable reforms to protect the environment.	False	False	True	False	False
576	dailymail	questionable_source	2018-12-03	Trump's words and actions threaten to derail climate change efforts Donald Trump is threatening to derail climate change efforts with his persistent denial of global warming, claim scientists. Pulling the US from the Paris Agreement has opened the flood gates as several others, including Russia and Turkey, follow his lead. Trump removed the US, the second greatest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, from the Paris Agreement as one of his first major presidential acts. One expert has published a study and said that the withdrawal of the US from the 2015 Paris Agreement as well as Trump's ill-informed remarks on climate change could have long-lasting and severe ramifications.A United Nations-sponsored climate summit in Poland has kicked off today which brings together experts from around the world as leading figures in the UN claim our planet has reached a 'crossroads'. They say the next two years are crucial to our success if we are to successfully halt global warming.A study, from the Institute of International and European Affairs, says Trump's decision has created the 'moral and political cover for others to follow suit' in leaving the agreement. It also claims it has soured the atmosphere and damaged goodwill in the international arena.'The Paris agreement sent a shiver down the spine of institutional investors globally and made them question if they were exposed to stranded assets and whether these political leaders were really serious about climate change,' said Joseph Curtin, a senior fellow at the IIEA.'There's absolutely no doubt that the Trump effect has created a sense of uncertainty in terms of the political commitment to achieve anything close to a 2°C target.'The Paris Agreement, which was first signed in 2015, is an international agreement to control and limit climate change. It hopes to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2°C (3.6°F) 'and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C (2.7°F)'Sir David Attenborough will be in attendance in the 'people's seat' to represent the people who are affected by global warming. He gave a speech at the opening ceremony of the summit and said: ''We are facing a man-made disaster of global scale.'Our greatest threat in thousands of years. Climate Change.'The Conference of the Parties (COP) comes shortly after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) announced the intention to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C. This gathering has been pegged as the most influential since the 2015 ratification of the Paris Agreement. It claimed that to achieve this goal, governments around the world would have to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 45 per cent by 2030. Four influential previous presidents of the talks called for decisive action to reach these targets. They said the planet sits at a 'crossroads' and urged action to cut emissions and reach Paris targets. Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary-General, said this period of time is 'a matter of life and death' for countries around the world.A statement from the former chiefs came a day before the summit was scheduled to begin and is a highly unusual move. It earmarked the next two years as a key opportunity to help halt climate change. It read: 'What ministers and other leaders say and do in Katowice at COP24 will help determine efforts for years to come and either bring the world closer to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement - including protecting those most vulnerable to climate change - or push action further down the road.'Any delay will only make it harder and more expensive to respond to climate change.'The statement was issued by Frank Bainimarama of Fiji, Salaheddine Mezouar of Morocco, Laurent Fabius of France and Manuel Pulgar Vidal of Peru. In a report released ahead of the climate summit in Poland, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) pointed out that the 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years. It found that 2018 is on course to be the 4th warmest year on record and we're the 'last generation to be able to do something about it'. The UN agency said in its provisional report that 'the past four years - 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 - are also the four warmest years in the series'.	True	False	False	False	False
738	The Guardian	left_center_bias	2017-04-27	Bernie Sanders takes aim at Trump on climate ahead of march in DC As protesters prepare for nationwide demonstrations against Donald Trump's environmental agenda, Bernie Sanders on Thursday backed legislation that would phase out the use of fossil fuels in the US by 2050." r President, start listening to the people and the scientists, not the greed of the fossil fuel industry," Sanders said at a rally on Capitol Hill, where he was flanked by environmental advocates and two of his Democratic colleagues, Senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who authored the bill, and Ed Markey of Massachusetts." s you all know," the Vermont senator and former presidential candidate told the crowd, "Donald Trump is wrong about a lot of things. But there is no area where he is more wrong than on the issue of climate change." Sanders added: "No, Mr President, climate change is not a hoax. Climate change is real." At the event, held just outside the US Capitol, Sanders, Merkley and Markey unveiled legislation which seeks to completely phase out the use of fossil fuels through a transition to 100% clean and renewable energy by the middle of this century. But the bill, called the 100 by '50 Act, is unlikely to be considered by a Republican-controlled Congress, where many GOP lawmakers are still unwilling to acknowledge the science behind global warming and contribution of human activity. The partisan nature of the debate was not lost on the audience, as one attendee interrupted the proceedings to ask: "Where are the Republicans?""We're going to have to recruit those colleagues across the aisle," said Merkley, who ranks among the Senate's most progressive voices. "This is not a red or a blue issue," he said. "There is no excuse for failure. This is the biggest test facing human civilization and we have to respond and win this battle." Demonstrators are set to gather in Washington for the People's Climate March on Saturday, which will also mark the 100th day of the Trump administration. Similar marches are expected in major cities across the US, as part of a broader effort to oppose Trump's efforts to roll back the climate initiatives put in place by Barack Obama. The president has signaled his intentions to tear up the landmark Paris climate agreement, forged by more than 195 nations in late 2015, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28% over a decade. Trump's top aides, who are split on whether or not the US should remain part of the Paris accord, were scheduled to meet on Thursday afternoon to discuss the deal's future. Trump's chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, is a vocal proponent of pulling out immediately. Trump has vowed to withdraw from the Paris agreement, and has already taken steps through executive action to begin the process of overturning Obama-era environmental regulations. Among them was a directive to the EPA to dismantle the Clean Power Plan, one of Obama's signature climate policies to reduce carbon pollution from power plants. Trump also signed an executive order that aims to unravel the Obama rule designed to protect American waterways from pollution, and proposed in his budget draconian cuts to the EPA. At the rally, Markey said Trump's actions were precisely why hundreds of thousands of people felt compelled to take to the streets." onald Trump [is] still saying that he's going to issue a new executive order allowing for more oil drilling on the public lands of the United States of America," he said, drawing jeers for the president from the crowd. "That is just completely and totally unacceptable."	False	False	True	False	False
310	dailymail	questionable_source	2019-06-27	The US produced more energy from renewable sources than from coal for the first time ever in April In April, for the first time ever, the US produced more energy from renewable sources than from coal in a single month. According to data from the US Energy Information Administration, hydroelectric dams, solar panels, and wind turbines generated 68.5 million megawatt-hours of energy during the month of April 2019. This was compared to 60 million megawatt-hours of energy produced from coal in the same month. The trend comes despite President Donald Trump pledging to 'bring back' the coal industry, which has been hit hard by competition from cheaper natural gas and renewable energy. The US has been shifting toward natural gas, which is not only cheaper than coal, but also emits less carbon dioxide. However, experts noted that several coal plants were down for routine maintenance in April, and the month saw an increase in wind generation and a drop in energy demand. This suggests that coal could easily take over from renewable sources in the following months. Despite this, a report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) said that the trend could potentially extend into the month of May. The trend will happen sporadically throughout the next several years, says the IEEFA, as renewable energy becomes cheaper and the world's attention focuses on mitigating the effects of carbon-fueled climate change by turning away from fossil fuels. Growth in both solar and wind power has been particularly stark with the former producing 48 times more electricity than it did a decade ago due to cheaper equipment and government incentives. Coupled with a rise in renewables has been a trend of declining coal consumption. Last year, coal hit a nearly 40-year low in terms of proportional usage in the U.S. Coal has fallen out of favor in part due to decreasing costs of natural gas. In 2016, it was dethroned as the America's fuel of choice by natural gas, a feat aided in part by a thriving hydro-fracking industry that continues to pump abundant fossil fuels out of the Bakken Oil Shale in North Dakota. The Trump administration on Wednesday completed one of its biggest rollbacks of environmental rules, replacing a landmark Obama-era effort that sought to wean the nation's electrical grid off coal-fired power plants and their climate-damaging pollution. Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist, signed a replacement rule that gives states leeway in deciding whether to require efficiency upgrades at existing coal plants. Wheeler said coal-fired power plants remained essential to the power grid, something that opponents deny.'Americans want reliable energy that they can afford,' he said at a news conference. There's no denying 'the fact that fossil fuels will continue to be an important part of the mix,' he said.	False	False	False	False	False
233	npr	left_center_bias	2019-08-08	To Slow Global Warming, U.N. Warns Agriculture Must Change Humans must drastically alter food production to prevent the most catastrophic effects of global warming, according to a new report from the United Nations panel on climate change. The panel of scientists looked at the climate change effects of agriculture, deforestation and other land use, such as harvesting peat and managing grasslands and wetlands. Together, those activities generate about a third of human greenhouse gas emissions, including more than 40% of methane. That's important because methane is particularly good at trapping heat in the atmosphere. And the problem is getting more severe." Emissions from agricultural production are projected to increase," the authors warn. "Delaying action" on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, they continue, "could result in some irreversible impacts on some ecosystems." This is the latest in a series of reports from the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The new report adds weight and detail to a warning put out by the same panel of scientists last fall, in which they sounded the alarm about the inadequacy of the pledges countries have made so far to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. At that time, the panel broadly suggested that farmland would need to shrink and forests would need to grow to keep Earth from getting more than 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than it was in the preindustrial era. Global temperatures have already risen about 1 degree Celsius in the past 150 years. To meet that temperature target, global greenhouse gas emissions will need to fall by 40% to 50% in the next decade. Scientists say the only way to achieve that reduction is to significantly increase the amount of land that's covered in trees and other vegetation and significantly reduce the amount of methane and other greenhouse gases that come from raising livestock such as cows, sheep and goats. The new report offers some broad suggestions for how countries might achieve that. For example, for countries that have lost tree cover in the past century, reforestation can help suck greenhouse gases out of the air, while also preventing soil from drying up. Reducing food waste can also help reduce a country's greenhouse gas footprint. Controlling emissions from agriculture is also a food-security issue. Greenhouse gases from food production create a vicious cycle: As Earth gets hotter, farming gets more difficult in many places, which forces farmers to clear more land to grow food." Climate change, including increases in frequency and intensity of extremes, has adversely impacted food security and terrestrial ecosystems, as well as contributed to desertification and land degradation in many regions," the report's authors write. If greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase, as they are doing today, it will exacerbate those challenges and eventually make it all but impossible to control global warming without creating serious food shortages. The U.N. panel is the latest group of experts to grapple with a global conundrum: how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, deforestation and other land use without creating food shortages or displacing people whose livelihoods rely on practices that are unsustainable globally. Scientists and economists have been studying the effects of our diets on the environment for years. There's a growing consensus that a transition to a more plant-centered diet would help. Currently, about 50% of the globe's vegetated land is dedicated to agriculture — and about 30% of cropland is used to grow grain for animal feed. Given how much land it takes to grow food to feed livestock, meat production is a leading cause of deforestation.A report released last month by the World Resources Institute finds that if current dietary patterns continue, an additional 593 million hectares — which is almost twice the size of India — would be needed to feed the projected 9.8 billion people (the anticipated population) by 2050. Right now, agriculture generates an estimated 25% of annual greenhouse gas emissions, according to the WRI; that's when you combine food production and the land-use changes associated with farming, such as clearing vegetation and plowing. If current trends continue, but agricultural productivity does not increase beyond 2010 levels, the WRI report concludes that most of the globe's remaining forests would need to be cleared to feed the world. And the globe would exceed the greenhouse gas emission targets set by the Paris climate agreement.	True	False	False	False	False
676	The Huffington Post	left_bias	2017-10-10	Trump Axes Climate Plan As The World Burns Wildfires are raging through California's wine country. Flooded homes in Houston, Texas, are still rotting. Puerto Ricans are languishing in darkness, collecting drinking water from streams. And South Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands were still picking through the rubble, as yet another hurricane made landfall over the mouth of the Mississippi River. Scientists say the frequency and severity of natural disasters like these are linked to climbing global temperatures. But the Trump administration on Tuesday announced plans to repeal the United States' only major policy to combat climate change. The Clean Power Plan ― a set of Obama-era regulations aimed at slashing emissions from coal-fired power plants and boosting renewable energy production ― had yet to go into effect, after being temporarily blocked by the Supreme Court since February 2016. On Tuesday afternoon, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt ― who sued to halt the plan last year when he was Oklahoma's attorney general ― released a proposal to eliminate the policy without any replacement, leaving the country without a national strategy to adapt to global warming. Rain soaked the state last winter, stacking its mountains with colossal snowdrifts and quenching soil left parched after more than half a decade of historic drought. But record-breaking heat baked the West in July and August, drying its woodlands and leaving it vulnerable to the sort of blaze now engulfing the wine-producing region neighboring San Francisco." hese people have either no sense or a very sophisticated sense of irony to be doing this at this time," he added, referring to the Trump administration. Following an exceptionally hot summer, 172 fires ― 78 of which qualified as "large" incidents according to the National Interagency Fire Center ― burned more than 8 million acres in western Montana and the Pacific Northwest. That's almost double the 10-year average of 5.5 million acres. Elsewhere, a spate of fierce hurricanes inundated parts of the South and Caribbean. Warmer oceans tend to exacerbate storms and shift their directions. After Hurricane Harvey dumped 30 inches of rain on Houston in August, scientists warned that the Category 4 storm served as a teachable example of the type of weather event their models predict will become more common as the planet continues to warm. The next few weeks proved Mother Nature to be a cruel instructor. Hurricane Irma rampaged through the Caribbean before slamming into Florida as a Category 5 beast, knocking out power for millions and ultimately killing 69 people. Less than two weeks later, Hurricane Maria pummeled Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, crippling the U.S. territories' power grids and leaving whole areas uninhabitable. In Puerto Rico, which has a larger population than 21 U.S. states, the death toll continues to climb, hitting 39 this week as the island's aging utility struggles to rebuild electrical transmission wires. But the proposal to scrap the policy without any kind of replacement to curb greenhouse gases underscores the extent to which the Trump administration's refusal to acknowledge basic climate science is leaving the country vulnerable to global warming effects that are no longer theoretical." t is crazy to think about having an EPA administrator who has nothing to offer in replacement of an admittedly not-so-good regulatory solution," former Rep. Bob Inglis (R-S.C.), now the executive director of the conservative environmental advocacy group RepublicEn, told HuffPost by phone on Tuesday. "To get rid of the Clean Power Plan without any idea of what to do that could be better is malfeasance on the part of the EPA administrator."	False	True	True	False	False
883	Breitbart	questionable_source	2017-10-12	Delingpole: Aussie ex-PM Abbott Slams Climate Change 'Religion' Some of us knew this already. But you rarely hear it so trenchantly expressed by a former world leader – as it was in London yesterday by Aussie ex-Prime Minister Tony Abbott in a hard-hitting, must-read speech for the Global Warming Policy Foundation. Abbott is one of only a handful of world leaders to have spoken out against the global warming "consensus." (The only other ones, recently, are former Czech president Václav Klaus and, of course, President Donald Trump). This gives you an idea of just how badly infected are the nations of the free world by the green virus. Even those politicians who might nurture doubts in private almost never express them in public. Abbott himself lost his job as Australia's prime minister at least in part because he was found guilty of wrongthink on climate change, which he once famously described as "crap". The man who replaced him as prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull – unfondly known as the "Honourable Member for Goldman Sachs" – is himself a leading tentacle of the Green Blob. Abbott's speech – which is causing Australia's notoriously left-wing media to explode like ripe watermelons struck by hollow-point bullets – ought to serve as a painful reminder to Australia's Liberal party of the talent they lost when they decided to knife this Jesuit-trained, Oxford-educated, rock-solid, family man conservative in the back and replace him with the slippery Davos-style globalist Turnbull. Here are some of the highlights:Climate change is a product of ignorance and an anti-Christian societyIf science was all about "consensus" we'd still be living in cavesGreens want to make life nasty, brutish and shortWhere's the evidence for climate catastrophe? There's none in Australia, that's for sure…Contrary to the breathless assertions that climate change is behind every weather event, in Australia, the floods are not bigger, the bushfires are not worse, the droughts are not deeper or longer, and the cyclones are not more severe than they were in the 1800s. Sometimes, they do more damage but that's because there's more to destroy, not because their intensity has increased. More than 100 years of photography at Manly Beach in my electorate does not suggest that sea levels have risen despite frequent reports from climate alarmists that this is imminent.…But there's plenty of evidence that green lunacy is killing the Australian economyRenewables have more to do with virtue-signalling than with useful energyThere's a reason renewable energy is crap and it's so simple even lefties and greens should be able to understand itHydro aside, renewable energy should properly be referred to as intermittent and unreliable power. When the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine, the power doesn't flow. Wind and solar power are like sailing ships; cheaper than powered boats, to be sure, but we've stopped using sail for transport because it couldn't be trusted to turn up on time. Because the weather is unpredictable, you never really know when renewable power is going to work. Its marginal cost is low but so is its reliability, so in the absence of industrial scale batteries, it always needs matching capacity from dependable coal, gas, hydro, or nuclear energy. This should always have been obvious. We think we're rational but where green policy is concerned we're little better than the AztecsOh and by the way, the way we're carrying on Western Civilization is on its way out…	False	False	True	True	True

Mulvaney announced that the G-7 meetings would be held on June 10 and 11 at the Trump National Doral Golf Club, just west of Miami, an area threatened by sea level rise brought on by climate change. With its low elevations and porous limestone bedrock, South Florida is particularly vulnerable to sea level rise. Despite warnings from the scientific community, developers including Trump have continued to invest in property that could be underwater before long." ust using the U.S. government projections, we could be at 11 to over 13 feet [of sea level rise] by the end of century," Harold Wanless, director of the University of Miami's geological sciences department and a leading expert on sea level rise, told Yahoo News. "There's only 3 percent of Miami-Dade County that's greater than 12 feet above sea level." Trump has labeled climate change a "hoax" concocted by the Chinese government in an attempt to ruin the U.S. economy, but not all members of the Republican Party agree. For the first time in a decade, Florida's state Senate held a meeting this week to discuss the impacts of climate change, the Miami Herald reported." here's a younger generation of conservatives in this state that aren't as much in denial," Republican Sen. Tom Lee, who chairs the Committee on Infrastructure and Security, told the Herald. Young climate activists like Sweden's Greta Thunberg have mobilized students around the world to hold school strikes to protest inaction from world leaders on what they see as a crisis." omething must have changed in the debate that so many young people are speaking up and so many young people are being targeted," Thunberg told Yahoo News in response to the mockery her movement has received from leaders like Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. "They can sense that we are making an impact. They obviously don't want that. So they are using several methods to mock and hate." While Trump continues to deny the threat that climate change poses to his own properties and the world at large, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco released a report Thursday on the financial risks that global warming poses. It found that properties like Doral that are likely to be underwater in the coming years are already selling for 15 percent less than those where flooding is not a threat. Even more jarring, the report warned that climate change poses a "threat to the availability of the 30-year mortgage in various vulnerable and highly exposed areas." Thanks to the continued buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere due primarily to the use of fossil fuels, the rate at which the polar icecaps are melting continues to exceed previous estimates. As of Aug. 1 of this year, for instance, Greenland had lost a record 12.5 billion tons of ice. This year is on pace to become the second warmest on record, and all of the top 10 hottest years on record — with the exception of 1998 — have occurred since 2005.

Trump mocked for his 'natural instinct for science' on climate change While a sobering new UN report on climate change indicates humans might have little time to change our ways to avoid environmental catastrophe, President Trump isn't worried, pointing to scientists "on both sides of the picture." Referencing an uncle who was a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (whom he never spoke to about climate change) as apparent proof of his scientific bona fides, Trump told the Associated Press that he has "a natural instinct for science" and that the climate goes "back and forth, back and forth." The US president remains unconvinced that human activity is the cause of climate change. While he has backed away from a 2012 claim that the concept was "created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing noncompetitive," he is now convinced that "something's changing and it'll change back again," according to an interview he gave with 60 Minutes on Sunday. Trump's appointee to the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, notoriously attempted to roll back several key environmental regulations passed under Barack Obama, including the Clean Power Plan, the Clean Water Rule, and a proposed ban on the pesticide chlorpyrifos. Pruitt also oversaw a 23 percent budget cut to the agency and filled science advisory panels with industry representatives instead of unaffiliated scientists. Trump may believe in climate change now, but he remains convinced that scientists who see a human role in the process have "a very big political agenda." Meanwhile, he doesn't want to "sacrifice the economic well-being of our country for something that nobody really knows." While some Democrats favor bold moves to address climate change, others – perhaps still shell-shocked by the failure of their 2009 cap-and-trade bill under Obama – shy away from anything more than incremental measures, citing the "hostile" political environment in Congress. Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA) said Democrats should "focus on the practical and the opportunistic" in the short term while working toward big-picture "aspirational goals" in the long term. Some might argue the concept of a "long term," when it comes to the environment, was rendered irrelevant by the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report. It projected that humans have until 2030 to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions if we want to avoid catastrophic climate change in the form of massive sea level rise, increased drought, permafrost melt, and coral reef die-offs.

618	Drudge Report	right_bias	2017-10-24	Residents of shrinking island reject 'climate victim' label... TANGIER ISLAND, Va. (Reuters) - This summer, a delegation of Republican climate activists visited Tangier Island, a speck of grassland in Virginia's Chesapeake Bay, to try to convince its 450 residents to take climate change seriously. At a dinner attended by island residents Aug. 2, the activists from RepublicEn headed by former Republican Congressman Bob Inglis laid out the stakes: The sea level is rising, and some scientists estimate that within decades the island, already suffering severe erosion, will need to be abandoned. The people of Tangier Island were used to this kind of message. Former Vice President Al Gore, a prominent Democratic climate activist, had given the same speech to islanders three days earlier. They were also used to rejecting it." We'll talk to everybody," said James Eskridge, mayor of the mainly Republican island community. "But they're not going to change many minds here." Residents, he said, do not believe in climate change: they want a new sea wall to prevent erosion, not a lecture about saving the world with solar panels. Tangier Island's steadfast rejection of climate change reflects the rigidity of American opinions about global warming, often defined along political party lines. Reuters/Ipsos polling shows more than a third of Americans, mainly Republicans, reject the scientific consensus that climate change is driven by human activity. Less than a third of Americans believe global warming poses an imminent threat to the United States. These views barely budged after a series of devastating hurricanes this summer. That rift in opinion has proven to be a headwind for U.S. lawmakers seeking broad solutions to stem climate change, like imposing a cost on carbon emissions or encouraging cleaner renewable energy technologies to replace fossil fuels. And while conservatives have long been skeptical about climate change, doubters have a powerful new ally: U.S. President Donald Trump. He has called climate change a hoax and has started withdrawing the United States from a global pact to combat it, citing what he calls the huge economic cost. Eskridge told Reuters Trump called him in June after seeing a report about severe erosion problems on the island, telling him not to worry about sea level rise."I believe man plays a part in it but not to the extent that others have been talking about - that's what me and Donald Trump were talking about," Eskridge said.'WE'RE LOOKING TO STAY'An Army Corps of Engineers study in 2015 showed Tangier has lost two thirds of its mass since 1850 because of erosion, a process scientists say is being exacerbated by climate change. Journalists and politicians now view the island as a symbol of the climate crisis. Tangier residents are happy with the attention but believe their problem is simpler. A sea wall built on one side of the island in the late 1980s has prevented the land behind it from eroding, they say, so another sea wall is the answer." We're not looking to have our light bills cheaper, we're looking to stay here," said Deborah Pruitt, 57, who works at the island's museum, where printouts of news reports about the island are displayed on a wall. Conservative climate activists like Rob Sisson of ConservAmerica and Mitch Hescox of the Evangelical Environmental Network said the rejection of climate change by Tangier residents is not surprising: their groups often have trouble convincing fellow Republicans global warming is a real issue. Often, they say, people object to the idea that humans could possibly change the climate even if they wanted to. Florida Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, one of a handful of Republicans to publicly declare a belief in climate change, said she has a strategy for getting fellow Republicans to think of solutions: "I've found that the best way ... is to not dwell on the causes," she said in an email.

863	Breitbart	questionable_source	2017-09-27	Jerry Brown Wants to Impose 'China-Style' Ban on Combustion Engine Cars Governor Jerry Brown has expressed an interest in barring the sale of vehicles powered by internal-combustion engines, Mary Nichols, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, said in an interview Friday at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. The earliest such a ban is at least a decade away, she said. Brown, one of the most outspoken elected official in the U.S. about the need for policies to combat climate change, would be replicating similar moves by China France and the U.K. "I've gotten messages from the governor asking, 'Why haven't we done something already?'" Nichols said, referring to China's planned phase-out of fossil-fuel vehicle sales. "The governor has certainly indicated an interest in why China can do this and not California." "To reach the ambitious levels of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, we have to pretty much replace all combustion with some form of renewable energy by 2040 or 2050," Nichols said. "We're looking at that as a method of moving this discussion forward." Instituting such a policy in California would affect the entire car industry globally, due to the massive size of California's car market. Over 2 million new passenger vehicles were sold and registered in the nation's most populous state last year — more than than the entire nations of Spain, France and Italy. California has had the right to write its own pollution rules since the 1970's under waivers granted by the EPA. But it's unlikely the Trump administration would approve such a plan, forcing California to take a different legal route. According to Motor Trend magazine, Nichols says California is considering regulating the types of cars that can be registered in the state or have access to highways. "We certainly wouldn't expect to get a waiver for that from the EPA," she told Bloomberg. "I think we would be looking at using some of our other authorities to get that result." China plans to end sales of combustion engine vehicles in 2030. Other countries like France and the U.K. plan to follow suit a decade later. California has not yet specified a date to copy China's policy. Tim Donnelly is a former California State Assemblyman and Author, currently on a book tour for his new book: Patriot Not Politician: Win or Go Homeless.  He also ran for governor in 2014.

501	yahoonews	left_center_bias	2018-03-13	For climate hawks, firing Tillerson is a case of &apos;be careful what you wish for&apos; Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrives at a meeting of the National Space Council in Chantilly, Va., on Oct. 5, 2017. (Photo: Andrew Harnik/AP)President Trump's dismissal of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson Tuesday morning fulfilled a long-held wish for climate advocates, but they fear his replacement, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, will be even worse. Tillerson joined Exxon in 1975 and rose through the ranks over the decades. He was CEO and chairman of ExxonMobil from 2006 until he joined the Trump administration in 2017. That Trump would nominate a lifelong oilman to succeed John Kerry, who led the U.S. through the Paris climate negotiations of late 2015, as the nation's top diplomat resulted in predictable and fierce pushback. During his confirmation hearing in January 2017, however, Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he thought the United States should stay in the Paris Agreement, which strives to reduce global warming to 2°C (3.6°F). He also suggested that a carbon tax may be the best way to limit the greenhouse-gas emissions driving global warming. Pompeo, on the other hand, identified with the tea party and represented Kansas's Fourth Congressional District from 2011 to 2017. He received more financial backing from Koch Industries, an energy and natural resources conglomerate, than any other candidate in the 2010 elections: $80,000. In fact, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a bipartisan research group that tracks the effect of lobbying on elections and policy, Pompeo has received more money from Koch interests than any other House member. In just four election cycles (2010, 2012, 2014, 2016), he received the following: $335,000 from Koch Industries employees, which includes $92,000 from the Koch family; $69,000 from the Koch Industries PAC; $417,175 from Americans for Prosperity, an advocacy group funded by the Kochs; and $87,532 from other organizations with substantial funding by the Koch brothers. And Pompeo turned to the Koch brothers, who actively oppose climate change legislation, for money long before running for office. In the late '90s, Koch Industries invested in an aerospace company Pompeo founded with fellow West Point alumni. He sold his interest in Thayer Aerospace in 2006 and became president of Sentry International, which produces and sells oil field equipment. In short, even though environmentalists adamantly opposed Tillerson, they do not expect anything positive for the climate from Pompeo. Jake Schmidt, the international program director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, released the following statement: "Replacing the man from Big Oil with a first-class climate denier simply goes from bad to worse. This shuffling of the deck chairs will ensure that Washington continues to bring up the rear when it comes to international action to combat dangerous climate change." Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president of government affairs for the League of Conservation Voters, said in a statement that Pompeo's nomination is profoundly disturbing but not unexpected." hough not surprising, this is extremely troubling. Climate change is one of the most critical threats facing our nation and world, and the secretary of state has a huge responsibility to make sure it is addressed by the global community," she said. "With a history of questioning the science of climate change, a close relationship with the polluter Koch brothers and lifetime LCV score of 4%, Mike Pompeo has no business becoming the next secretary of state." Naomi Ages, the climate director of Greenpeace USA, was similarly perturbed." onald Trump has now somehow picked someone even worse than Rex Tillerson to run the State Department. Greenpeace has been opposed to Tillerson as secretary of state from the moment he was nominated, and we continue to believe that the U.S. government cannot and should not be run by fossil-fuel industry flunkies," Ages said in a statement. "Mike Pompeo, though, is uniquely unqualified to be secretary of state in an entirely different way than Rex Tillerson was. In addition to being a climate denier, like his predecessor, Pompeo is Koch brothers' shill who will denigrate the United States' reputation abroad and make us vulnerable to threats at home." Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., also took issue with Pompeo's past statements on climate change.	False	False	True	False	True
207	pbs	left_center_bias	2019-05-27	Europe wakes up to climate concerns after 'green wave' in vote BERLIN — Green parties in Germany, France, Britain and elsewhere celebratedbig gains in elections for the 751-seat European Parliament amid growing voterconcerns over climate change, expressed in large-scale student protests overrecent months. Provisional results Monday showed the left-leaning Greens' bloc coming fourthin the election with 69 seats, an increase of 17 compared with 2014. Ifconfirmed, the results could put the Greens in a position to tip the scaleswhen it comes to choosing the next head of the European Commission. The rise of the Greens, with their distinctly pro-European Union stance, marksa counterpoint to that of the far-right, anti-migrant parties that have beengrowing in popularity across Europe in recent years." hoever wants legitimacy from us and the legitimacy of the many who went ontothe streets will need to deliver now," said Sven Giegold, a leading candidatefor the German Green party that scooped up more than 20% of the votenationwide, an increase of almost 10% compared with 2014.)The drift from the traditional heavyweight parties to the Greens in Germanywas particularly pronounced in large cities such as Berlin, Munich andHamburg, and among young voters, where the party beat its bigger rivals amongall voters under 60, according to the Infratest dimap research institute. Armin Laschet, the governor of Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, and a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right Unionbloc, called the outcome "a wake-up call for politics." In neighboring France, 25% of voters aged 18-25 voted for the Greens, comparedwith 15% for the far-right National Rally and 12% for President EmmanuelMacron's Republic on the Move, according to the Ifop polling organization. Overall, the French green party EELV received almost 13.5% of the vote, comingthird. Yannick Jadot, lead candidate of EELV, welcomed the "great green wave" inEurope." he French sent us a very clear message: they want environment to be at theheart of our lives, at the heart of the political game and that message hasbeen spread across Europe," he said." he very good score of the greens in Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium and Francesends a signal that the center of gravity of the European politics isshifting, that in addition to the populists and the pro-business (parties),there are the Greens," Jadot said. Green parties also polled strongly in Austria, Sweden, Ireland, Denmark andthe Netherlands. In Britain, the Greens — a largely insignificant forcenationally — took 11 seats in the European Parliament vote." his was kind of a vote for all europhile and pro-integration positions theGreens have championed," Martin Florack, a political scientist at theUniversity of Duisburg-Essen, told German public broadcaster ARD. The enmity was reflected in comments by Alexander Gauland, the co-leader ofthe far-right Alternative for Germany party, who declared the Greens "our mainenemy" on Monday." he Greens will destroy this country and our job must and will be to fightthe Greens," said Gauland, whose party has claimed climate change isn't a man-made phenomenon but instead caused by factors such as solar activity, a theorymost scientists dismiss.A senior member of the anti-immigration and euroskeptic Danish People's Party,Kenneth Kristensen Berth, said the issues of the climate and the environmentwere "a bit hysterical" during the election, but insisted that Denmark'ssecond-largest political group "is not a climate-denial party." Among those celebrating the Greens' rise was Biggi Tran, a 26-year-old inBerlin. She attributed the result to young people's fears about globalwarming." he climate issue is super important at the moment," Tran said. Manuel Rivera, a Green party member in the Germany capital, said the EuropeanParliament was the right place to tackle climate change."  think people realize that there are issues you can't solve at the nationallevel," he said. Giegold, the German Greens' lead candidate, said voters expect the party todeliver on its environmental pledges, not secure powerful posts in theexecutive European Commission." cross Europe this was a vote to protect the climate," he said. "Peopledidn't take to the streets to elect or kick out a party, but for theseproblems to be solved." Green lawmakers in the European Parliament plan to scrutinize the bloc's 200billion euro ($223.7 billion) agriculture budget, which environmentalists sayplaces too much emphasis on large-scale farming and not enough on eco-friendlyagriculture, he said. The Greens also want every law passed at the EU-level to undergo a climatecheck. The party has strongly backed scientists' calls for the bloc to end allgreenhouse gas emissions by mid-century. Achieving this goal would require a drastic shift in Europe's economy, awayfrom fossil fuels to clean energy and low-carbon lifestyles. Some measuresproposed for cutting emissions have already faced strong headwind, includingMacron's plan for a fuel tax hike in France that triggered protests fromworkers even as environmentalists accused the president of not doing enoughfor the climate._Sylvie Corbet in Paris, and Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin, contributed to thisreport._	True	False	True	False	True
757	The Guardian	left_center_bias	2017-06-02	US has nothing to apologize for on climate change, says defiant EPA chief The head of the Environmental Protection Agency has said America has nothing to apologise for on climate change and retains a seat at the negotiating table, claiming: "After all, we're the United States." Scott Pruitt joined other officials in declining to say whether Donald Trump believes human activity contributes to climate change, a day after the president pulled America out of the landmark Paris agreement. Pruitt claimed Trump wants better terms within the Paris framework or an entirely new deal, and dismissed warnings from world leaders that it is not negotiable." ell, that's up to them, right?" the EPA administrator told reporters. "The United States has a seat at the table. After all, we're the United States and we are leading with respect to CO2 reduction. We have made tremendous progress." f nations around the globe want to seek to learn from us on what we're doing to reduce our CO2 footprint, we're going to share that with them, and that's something that should occur and will occur in the future. We will reach out and reciprocate with nations that seek to achieve that." Trump announced on Thursday that the US, the world's second biggest greenhouse gas emitter, would immediately stop implementing the 195-nation agreement brokered by Barack Obama in 2015. There was a global backlash, and the EU said on Friday it will increase cooperation with China to combat climate change. Pruitt denied that America has abandoned the victims of climate change around the world, arguing that it has done "a tremendous amount" to reduce carbon output to 1990s levels and will stay engaged and continue to export relevant technology." his is not a message to anyone in the world that America should be apologetic of its CO2 position. We're actually making tremendous advances. We're just not going to agree to frameworks and agreements that put us at an economic disadvantage and hurt citizens across this country." He echoed Trump's attack on members of the agreement as having economic rather than environmental motives. "The world applauded when we joined Paris, and you know why? I think they applauded because they knew it was going to put this country at an economic disadvantage, and the reason European leaders want us to stay in is because they know it will continue to shackle our economy, though we are leading the world with respect to our CO2 reduction." The EPA administrator was asked repeatedly whether Trump believes climate change is a hoax, as Trump previously claimed, but refused to give a straight answer. "There's enough to deal with with respect to the Paris agreement and making an informed decision about this important issue," he said. "That's where our focus has been the last several weeks." For his own part, Pruitt acknowledged that global warming is occurring, and that "human activity contributes to it in some manner". But he added: "Measuring with precision, from my perspective, the degree of human contribution is very challenging." Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, was similarly evasive on the topic. Asked if he can talk to Trump about the cause of climate change and report back at the next press briefing, he replied: "If I can, I will." Spicer gave short shrift to suggestions that Trump's decision will lift China as a global leader. "I think part of the reason the president said it was a bad deal yesterday was because countries including China were not making substantial progress in reducing their carbon footprint." hey weren't doing enough and America was carrying the load, so I think by negotiating a better deal, hopefully we can get a better result for our country and the world." Nicaragua and Syria are the only countries not party to the Paris accord; the former says it is not ambitious enough. Under a long exit process, America's withdrawal will not be become formal until November 2020.	False	False	True	False	False
800	BBC	left_center_bias	2017-06-01	Paris climate deal: Trump pulls US out of 2015 accord President Donald Trump has announced that the US is withdrawing from the 2015 Paris climate agreement. He said moves to negotiate a new "fair" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers would begin. Mr Trump said during last year's presidential election campaign that he would take the step to help his country's oil and coal industries. Opponents say withdrawing from the accord is an abdication of US leadership on a key global challenge. The Paris agreement commits the US and 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures "well below" 2C above pre-industrial levels and "endeavour to limit" them even more, to 1.5C. Only Syria and Nicaragua did not sign up to the deal. Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, Mr Trump characterised the Paris agreement as a deal that aimed to hobble, disadvantage and impoverish the US. He claimed the agreement would cost the US $3tn in lost GDP and 6.5 million jobs - while rival economies like China and India were treated more favourably." In order to fulfil my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord... but begin negotiations to re-enter either the Paris accord or a really entirely new transaction on terms that are fair to the United States," he said. The speech contained several rhetorical flourishes reminiscent of his campaign speeches." We don't want other leaders and other countries laughing at us any more - and they won't be," he said."I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris. I promised I would exit or re-negotiate any deal which fails to serve America's interests. Many trade deals will soon be under re-negotiation." The BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan in Washington says the move will be welcomed by many Trump supporters, as for them this is less about science - and more about sending a signal to so-called global elites. Analysts say the US withdrawal from the Paris agreement will make it more difficult for the world to reach the goals that it set for itself in the Paris agreement. The US contributes about 15% of global emissions of carbon, but it is also a significant source of finance and technology for developing countries in their efforts to fight rising temperatures. Mr Trump did not give a timescale for US withdrawal, but White House sources had earlier suggested it could take up to four years. Former US President Barack Obama, who agreed to the Paris deal, immediately criticised the move, accusing the Trump administration of "rejecting the future". Republican congressional leaders and the US coal industry backed the move, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell supporting Mr Trump "for dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama administration's assault on domestic energy production and jobs". Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the decision "one of the worst policy moves made in the 21st Century because of the huge damage to our economy, our environment and our geopolitical standing". The leaders of France, Germany and Italy issued a joint statement rejecting a renegotiation of the agreement." We deem the momentum generated in Paris in December 2015 irreversible and we firmly believe that the Paris agreement cannot be renegotiated, since it is a vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies," it said. This was echoed by UK Prime Minister Theresa May, who expressed her disappointment and told Mr Trump in a phone call that the deal protects the "prosperity and security of future generations". Leaders of the Nordic nations - Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland - also condemned the move.A United Nations spokeswoman said it was a "major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security". Small island nations whose existence is threatened by rising sea levels were critical of the move. The President of the Marshall Islands, Hilda Heine, said it was "highly concerning for those of us that live on the frontline of climate change". Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk confirmed that he was leaving his role as an adviser to the Trump administration in protest." Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world," he tweeted. President Trump's statement is a very clear repudiation of the Paris agreement and international efforts to fund climate mitigation and adaptation in poorer countries. In many ways it is far worse than many had expected. He sees it as a clear job killer, as an economy strangler and a desperately unfair stitch-up by other countries wanting to take economic advantage of the US. He spoke of being open to re-negotiating the deal or trying to build a new agreement - but the idea of "re-negotiation" is an unlikely scenario. The scale of his opposition, seeing the deal as "a massive redistribution of US wealth to other countries" is a clear indication that he has fully bought into an economic nationalist and climate denier perspective. The question of unfairness cropped up again and again, how the world's worst polluters, China and India, had "no meaningful obligations" placed on them by the deal. The overall tone and content of his speech clearly plays to his base but is also a clear disavowal of multilateralism, especially on climate change, and will definitely push other countries more closely together on this issue. Climate change, or global warming, refers to the damaging effect of gases, or emissions, released from industry and agriculture on the atmosphere. The Paris accord is meant to limit the global rise in temperature attributed to emissions.	False	False	True	False	True
801	The New York Times	left_center_bias	2017-04-18	Trump Policy Advisers, Split Over Paris Accord, Will Debate U.S. Role in Pact Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, the former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, has also spoken in favor of "keeping a seat at the table" in the climate pact, and in recent days, major corporations have stepped forward to embrace that position. While no decision has been made, experts tracking it say that view is gaining traction." e do not currently believe the Trump administration plans to withdraw from either Paris agreement," wrote Kevin Book, an analyst at ClearView Energy Partners, a Washington firm, in a memo to clients on Monday. While Mr. Trump does not have the power to undo a multilateral United Nations accord, he could withdraw the world's largest economy from the pact, weakening it substantially. Such a move would win cheers from the nation's most powerful conservative political advocates, and give Mr. Trump bragging rights in coal country. But withdrawing from the landmark accord that committed nearly every nation to take action against planet-warming emissions could create diplomatic blowback, while weakening American leadership in arenas far afield from energy and the environment. Besides, keeping the United States' name on the accord does not obligate the Trump administration to abide by the ambitious emissions-control pledges of Mr. Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. At least one senior White House climate policy adviser, George David Banks, has advocated staying in the agreement while replacing the Obama plan with a weaker, more industry-friendly pledge. Over recent weeks, Mr. Banks has asked top officials at several major corporations, including Exxon Mobil, who have similar views, to submit letters to the White House confirming their support of staying in the Paris deal, even if in a modified form. In response, Peter Trelenberg, the manager of environmental policy and planning at Exxon Mobil, wrote to Mr. Banks, "Exxon Mobil supports the Paris agreement as an effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change." Royal Dutch Shell and BP, European companies with significant investments in the United States, have also endorsed the accord. Last month, Representative Kevin Cramer, a Republican from oil-, gas- and coal-rich North Dakota, wrote, "The U.S. should present a new pledge that does no harm to our economy." Mr. Cramer, an early supporter of Donald J. Trump, advised Mr. Trump on energy issues during his presidential campaign. Colin Marshall, the chief executive of Cloud Peak, a major coal producer in Wyoming, the nation's largest coal-mining state, also wrote to Mr. Trump: "By remaining in the Paris agreement, albeit with a much different pledge on emissions, you can help shape a more rational international approach to climate policy." Regardless of his decision, Mr. Trump has already undermined the United States' ability to meet its Paris pledge. Mr. Obama declared that the United States would reduce its planet-warming carbon pollution about 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. Its primary policy for meeting that target would be the Clean Power Plan, a set of Environmental Protection Agency regulations designed to shutter hundreds of heavily polluting coal-fired power plants, the nation's chief source of greenhouse emissions. Last month, Mr. Trump directed Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, to begin the legal process of dismantling the Clean Power Plan. Whether or not the United States remains in the Paris pact, it almost certainly will not be able to meet its pledged pollution-reduction targets. Mr. Pruitt has emerged as a leading voice for withdrawal from the Paris deal. Last week, he told Fox News, "It's something we need to exit." That reflects the views of powerful conservative political advocacy groups such as Americans for Prosperity, which is funded by the influential libertarian brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch." hat we say to the White House is that it's clearly a terrible agreement for the American people," said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity. That view is also backed by economists at the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank that has supplied the Trump administration with many of its policy proposals. Harold G. Hamm, the chief executive of Continental Resources and a Trump campaign adviser, has also condemned the pact. "Cancel the Paris climate treaty and any other agreements entered into unilaterally and without the consent of Congress," Mr. Hamm wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump before his inauguration. Bob Murray, the chief executive of the coal company Murray Energy, who is personally close with the president, has also strongly criticized the deal. Mr. Book, the analyst, noted that the risks of withdrawing from the Paris deal include not only diplomatic ill will, but also the possibility of trade reprisals. Countries that tax emissions of carbon dioxide pollution could place a carbon tariff on imports of American-made goods. The European Union currently charges polluters fees for carbon emissions, while China, Mexico and Canada are in the process of carrying out such programs." f the U.S. were to pull out, it would do so in the context that would invite trade reprisals," Mr. Book said. "It could lead to a carbon tariff trade war." Daniel M.

During a telethon fundraiser on Sept. 12, for Harvey and Irma relief, celebrities like Beyonce linked manmade climate change to the hurricanes. But the very stars participating in the telethon burn massive amounts of carbon dioxide by their extravagant lifestyles, just as Daily Mail reported on Sept. 13." he effects of climate change are playing out around the world every day," Beyonce claimed in a pre-recorded message. But if Beyonce and other celebrities were so concerned about a supposed connection between the devastation and climate change, why have they continued to ignore their own carbon gluttony?"The A-list celebrities who starred in the telethon for those affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma have clocked up hundreds of thousands of air miles which have fuelled rising temperatures and helped create devastating storms," Daily Mail foreign reporter Gareth Davies wrote. Climate change activists often claim carbon emissions from driving and flying are a significant cause of man-made warming. Davies found that, in just the past year, Leonardo DiCaprio, George Clooney, Justin Bieber and Beyonce produced at least 52.11 tons of carbon dioxide with their air travel alone. Bieber's jet-setting had the highest carbon footprint, an egregious 22 tons. In comparison, the average American's total carbon footprint is 20 tons. According to Davies, if "driving, pollution from their concerts or films and the electric in their homes are considered," the total was "likely to be astronomic." Although DiCaprio is a self-proclaimed environmentalist, he continued to live an incompatible lifestyle of massive carbon emissions. For the 2017 Oscars, DiCaprio and a fellow actor flew an someone 15,000 miles round trip to tidy their eyebrows. The actor also asked if "are we too late" to stop climate change and blasted the supposed "corporate greed of the coal, oil and gas industries" in January 2016. All while owning multiple mansions, vacationing on yachts and flying thousands of miles in private jets. Even Forbes noted, "DiCaprio himself is one of those "big polluters," which diminishes his moral authority to lecture others on reducing their own carbon emissions" in March 2016. Forbes also challenged DiCaprio's claim that he only produces 11 tons of carbon annually. Clooney criticized global warming skeptics as "stupid" and "ridiculous" in 2013. Despite his rhetoric on climate change however, the actor and his wife Amal owned eight homes as of March 2016, according to the Daily Mail. Other celebrities like Julia Roberts are also eco-hypocrites. In 2011, she co-wrote a USA Today op-ed demanding cleaner cooking stoves in third world countries to combat climate change. Yet she has owned five homes and a private jet all at the same time. More than 45 celebrities took part in the fundraiser, which brought in more than $44 million. All of the celebrities most likely live far more lavish, carbon-burning lives than average Americans.	False	True	False	True	False

According to NASA, IceBridge scientists measured the Larsen C fracture to be about 70 miles long, more than 300 feet wide and about a third of a mile deep. (Photo: John Sonntag/NASA via AP)In the six days before President Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change, an enormous crack in an Antarctic ice shelf grew 11 miles, according to a report by British Antarctic research group Project MIDAS. The crack, which is located in Larson Shelf C, leaves only eight miles of ice connecting what could be one of the world's largest recorded icebergs to Antarctica. When it eventually breaks free from the continent, the resulting iceberg will measure 31,000 square miles, represent 10 percent of the ice shelf's original mass and be larger than the state of Rhode Island. The growth spurt between May 25 and May 31 was the largest they have observed since January, Project MIDAS says, and the inevitable splintering of Ice Shelf C will drastically alter the landscape of the continent and will make the ice that remains less stable. The group states that although this specific crack was not likely caused by climate change, the disintegration of Antarctic ice shelves contributes to rising sea levels that threaten coastal cities." hen [ice shelves] disappear, ice can flow faster from the land to the ocean and contribute more quickly to sea level rise," Adrian Luckman and Martin O'Leary of Project MIDAS wrote in February. Rising sea levels endanger heavily populated cities such as New York, San Francisco, New Orleans and Miami, and are predicted to cause 13.1 million Americans to relocate from coastal areas by 2100. Concern about rising sea levels was one of many factors that inspired the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting the rise of global temperatures. Project MIDAS expects the ice shelf to mimic the break up of Larson Ice Shelf B, which shattered over a period of two weeks in 2002." he calving event will probably be slow and graceful," the scientists of Project MIDAS wrote. "The ice is already floating, so when the fracture breaks all the way through, it will simply start to drift away." The group is unsure exactly when the rapidly growing crack will cause Ice Shelf C to break free from Antarctica, but believes that the rift has now reached a region of soft ice and that there is very little holding the ice shelf together." e are watching with bated breath," the team wrote.

223	bbc	left_center_bias	2019-11-06	Why is India's pollution much worse than China's? As India's north continues to struggle with extreme pollution levels, the story has put a fresh spotlight on air quality in cities across Asia. Beijing has long been notorious for its smog - but statistics show that India, Pakistan and Bangladesh have worse air by far. So why is South Asia so much more polluted?Of the world's most polluted 30 cities, 22 are in India, according to research by IQ AirVisual, a Swiss-based group that gathers air-quality data globally, and Greenpeace. The remaining eight cities are all in Pakistan, Bangladesh and China - but the list doesn't include Beijing, which comes in at number 122. Just looking at global capitals, it's also Asian cities that top the ranking. Looking at overall countries, it's Bangladesh that has the worst air, followed by Pakistan and then India. All these rankings are based on average air quality per year. As these countries have very different densities of measuring stations and transparency of data, the statistics have to be read with a degree of caution. But they certainly indicate an overall trend.• The fight against air pollution in three global citiesWhy is India worse off than China?Pollution in urban areas is usually a mix of different factors - mostly traffic, fossil fuel burning power plants and heavy industries. What differentiates China from India is that in the latter, there is still a lot of burning of agricultural stubble when farmers want to clear their fields. The burning usually takes place in autumn." In this episode, the big problem really seems to have been the agricultural burning," assistant professor Thomas Smith of the London School of Economics told the BBC." That's one thing that China has tackled. All agricultural burning has been banned, full stop."A global overview for fires and thermal abnormalities is made available by Nasa, and allows users to track developments over past days and weeks. The area north-west of Delhi shows a highly unusual concentration of fires, Prof Smith points out." And you can't underestimate how important agricultural burning is - even though people often think only of cars and heavy industry as the causes." In the wake of the pollution spike, India's Supreme Court ordered a stop to stubble burning in the states around Delhi. But the city's situation is made worse by the colder winter air which is more stagnant, trapping the pollutants in place. Prof Smith also points out that "while India is largely reactive, Beijing tends to be more proactive and preventative to try to stop the problems from happening in the first place". What does pollution feel like?Pollution levels are categorised by measuring the levels of dangerous particles in the air. The result is then classified on a scale from good to hazardous." The effect of pollution is different for every person," explains Dr Christine Cowie of the University of New South Wales." Some people complain about irritation to the eyes, to the throat, exacerbations of wheeze and asthma symptoms. Coughing is certainly also a very common symptom - even in non-asthmatic people." And of course it's the elderly who suffer, the very young and people with pre-existing respiratory illnesses like or heart problems." She explains that even a short exposure to the unhealthy or worse pollution levels can trigger an asthma attack or increase the risk of a stroke. The longer the exposure, the greater the risks. And the ways to protect oneself are limited. There's the advice to stay indoors, to reduce physical exercise and to wear a mask - but in many poorer parts of the world, none of these options really work for regular people." It is toxic air," says David Taylor, professor of tropical environmental change at the National University of Singapore." It must be very uncomfortable - especially if you're having to work outside and if you're having to do jobs that require quite a lot of energy." You feel like it's hard to breathe," agrees Prof Smith." It's like doing hardcore exercise when you just take a walk outside. And depending on the kind of pollution, you can of course also smell it in the air." How does it compare to Europe or the US?Today, pollution levels in Europe, Australia and the US are significantly lower than the extreme readings that India has experienced in the past few days. But it's not always been like that. London, for instance, was notorious for its pollution during much of the 19th and early 20th centuries. As late as 1952, the so-called Great Smog covered London with a thick toxic layer of pollution, bringing the city almost to a standstill for days, not unlike the situation in Delhi now. It's thought to have resulted in thousands of deaths. While London experienced a different mix of pollutants, "it probably wasn't far off what's currently happening in Delhi," says Mr Taylor. Back then, power stations along the Thames were major polluters of the British capital. In fact - much of what we know today about the health impact of air pollution dates back to the experiences of the London smog during those years.	True	False	False	False	False
250	rt	questionable_source	2019-05-19	Joe Biden mocked for claiming to have started the climate change movement (VIDEO) Joe Biden has been roundly mocked on Twitter after making the unlikely claim to a young activist appealing for a presidential debate on climate change that he kicked-off the whole global warming movement back in the late 1980s.A young activist from US Youth Climate Strike asked Biden if he would support a presidential climate policy forum organized by the group. Biden interrupted the girl before she was finished, asking, "By the way, did you know I'm the guy who did all this? Read 'Real Clear Politics' – it will tell you about how I started this whole thing back in 1987 – climate change." Social media users were quick to criticize Biden's response, with some mocking him for saying he had started climate change, and others pointing out that his 1987 effort didn't really work out so well. Biden has repeatedly boasted of his 80's climate change concern, telling voters he was the first to introduce a climate bill. In 1987, Biden delivered a Senate speech warning of the dangers of global warming, and his Global Climate Protection Act called for setting up a task force to plan to tackle the issue. While he is the first to have a climate bill passed, he certainly isn't the first politician to raise the alarm about climate change, let alone have 'started' the whole thing. Congressman Al Gore held House hearings on climate change in 1976, and as a senator introduced a resolution calling for a research program into greenhouse gas emissions in 1985. The following year, Republican Senator John Chafee held Senate climate hearings warning of the "serious problem" and featuring an expert explaining that 'significant' warming could happen within 5-15 years. Biden has been criticized for reportedly planning a 'middle ground' approach to climate policy that is accused of lacking urgency and not going far enough. Think your friends would be interested?

765	Fusion	left_center_bias	2017-05-12	The contiguous U.S. will be glacier-free within decades thanks to global warming wikimedia commonsIt's now "inevitable" that the contiguous United States will lose all of its glaciers within a matter of decades, according to scientists who have revealed the precipitous shrinkage of dozens of glaciers in Montana. Warming temperatures have rapidly reduced the size of 39 named glaciers in Montana since 1966, according to comparisons released by the US Geological Survey (USGS) and Portland State University. Some have lost as much as 85% of their expanse over the past 50 years, with Glacier national park, site of 37 of the surveyed glaciers, set to lose all of its eponymous ice formations within the next few decades. Of the 150 glaciers that existed in the park in the late 19th century, only 26 remain. The disappearance of glaciers in Montana is part of a broader loss that will see all glaciers, defined as moving bodies of snow and ice larger than 25 acres, largely vanish from the lower 48 states of America by the mid point of the century, according to Dr Daniel Farge, lead USGS scientist." t's inevitable that we will lose them all over the next few decades," Farge said. "The Colorado glaciers started melting before Montana's and while there are larger glaciers in the Pacific north-west that will hold on longer, the number vanishing will steadily grow until none are left." Andrew Fountain, a geologist at Portland State, added: "While the shrinkage in Montana is more severe than some other places in the US, it is in line with trends that have been happening on a global scale." Rising temperatures – Montana is warming nearly twice as quickly as the global average – and changes in precipitation patterns are eroding away glaciers in the state and elsewhere along the Rocky mountains. Last year, scientists in Colorado found that the Arikaree glacier, which is likely more than 1,000 years old, has been thinning by around a metre (3.2ft) a year over the past decade and will vanish within 25 years.  Warming winters are bringing more rain, rather than glacier-forming snow, to Montana and other states. Even when there is plenty of snow, as Montana experienced this winter, the increasing heat of spring and summer is melting it away more quickly. Spring snow melts are now occurring at least two weeks earlier than they were in the 1960s. Scientists analyzed the extent of the 39 Montanan glaciers by studying aerial and satellite imagery stretching back to 1966. The latest data, from 2015, shows that there are now just 26 glaciers larger than 25 acres. The largest, Harrison glacier, is now 410 acres – a 19% decrease over the past 50 years. Others have declined by up to 85%. Glaciers have been in this stretch of the northern Rockies for around 7,000 years and the study of tree ring data and piles of rocks left behind by shifting glaciers show there were around 150 of the ice formations in the Glacier national park area in 1850. Most have now disappeared. Farge said glaciers started to shrink from around 1910 and then entered "rapid and continual" melting from the 1970s onwards. The environmental conditions now experienced in the region are a marked departure from historical norms." he glaciers have waxed and waned with different climate fluctuations but this is the first time they are heading for almost certain extinction," Farge said." his is the first time in 7,000 years they've experienced this temperature and precipitation. There's no hope for them to survive. We'd need a major reversal where it would get cooler, not just stop getting warmer. There's nothing to suggest that will happen." Farge said the decline of the glaciers outlined in the research is probably conservative as it focuses upon the extent of the glaciers, not the volume. Thinning glacier ice may cover a reasonable area but is particularly vulnerable to further warming and melting. Last year, 2.9m people visited Glacier national park. Future tourists will be confronted by a vista devoid of glaciers, a loss that Farge said will be "poignant"." e hope that loss contributes towards a dialogue about what to do about it," he said. "It's important that the data is out there and is being discussed." According to Nasa, the world's glaciers have lost around 400bn tons of ice per year since 1994, a decline that has impacted wildlife, increased wildfire risk in places and contributed to rapid sea level rise.

290	dailymail	questionable_source	2019-12-12	Donald Trump Jr. criticizes Time for naming eco-warrior Greta Thunberg as its person of the year President Donald Trump's eldest son Don Jr. has criticized Time magazine for naming Greta Person of the Year 2019 in a mocking tweet. The businessman denounced the choice as a 'marketing gimmick' and said the prize should have honored 'Hong Kong Protesters, fighting for their lives and freedoms' - his father was also a finalist. Tweeting yesterday in response to Time magazine he wrote: 'Time leaves out the Hong Kong Protesters fighting for their lives and freedoms to push a teen being used as a marketing gimmick.'The 16-year-old Swedish face of climate-activism made headlines after shouting 'How dare you?' at world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly earlier this year, accusing them of failing the younger generation. An image of her stare at Donald Trump as he entered the UN quickly became a social media meme. Miss Thunberg was up against four other Time's finalists including anti-government Hong Kong protesters, U.S. house speaker Nancy Pelosi, the anonymous whistleblower who revealed Trump's phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in July that may lead to his impeachment, and in ironically also Donald Trump. The young-activist attracted international attention after holding a sign that said 'skolstrejk för klimatet' or 'School strike for the climate' in Swedish parliament last year. The activist has drawn increasingly large crowds with her appearances at protests and conferences over the past year and a half. Veteran campaigners and scientists have welcomed her activism, including her combative speeches challenging world leaders to do more to stop global warming. Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal told the Today show: 'She became the biggest voice on the biggest issue facing the planet this year, coming from essentially nowhere to lead a worldwide movement.'He confirmed she is the magazine's youngest ever choice. Malala Yousafzai was runner up in 2012, losing out to Barack Obama, aged 15.U.S. president last month signed legislation backing the Hong Kong protesters in their fight for democracy - which could be the reason for his son's backing. The protests begun in March when an extradition bill, now suspended, called for those facing trials to be sent to mainland China, which was seen as a threat to the region's autonomy. Thunberg has not responded to the criticism but retweeted Time magazine's cover featuring herself. Today President Donald Trump lashed out at 16-year-old global warming activist Greta Thunberg on Thursday and told her to 'chill,' as he called her Time magazine 'Person of the Year' award 'ridiculous.''Greta must work on her Anger Management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend! Chill Greta, Chill!' Trump tweetedThe president was responding to Christian filmmaker Roma Downey, who tweeted the Time cover with the word 'Congrats.'Minutes after his tweet, Thunberg changed her Twitter profile biography to read: 'A teenager working on her anger management problem. Currently chilling and watching a good old fashioned movie with a friend.'Thunberg was in Madrid on Wednesday, where she addressed negotiators at the U.N.'s COP25 climate talks. There she accused political and business leaders of polishing their images rather than taking aggressive action in the fight against climate change at the UN climate talks. In a speech the teenager also criticized governments for avoiding taking action to cut greenhouse gas emissions and 'not behaving as if we are in an emergency'. Greta said: 'The biggest danger is not inaction; the real danger is when politicians and CEOs are making it look like real action is happening, when in fact almost nothing is being done apart from clever accounting and creative PR.'She said the science showed that, at the current rate of emissions, the world is set to use up the whole 'carbon budget' - the amount of pollution that can be put into the atmosphere and still keep global warming to 1.5C - in eight years.

691	Daily Kos	left_bias	2017-10-01	DEATH BY PIN PRICKS, Water Lilies &amp; Boiling Water There must be a new approach to public policy development that makes "Earth First." "Property," "economy," and "jobs" must serve "Earth First." The planning frame should be at least 100 years, possibly 1,000, NOT 25. Environmental change is occurring so fast that small decisions made locally avalanche regionally (e.g. downstream pollution), or even globally (e.g. ozone layer destruction). The Economic Growth discussion is always the same: "highest and best value" (a misnomer if ever there was one – profits trump survival - pun intended). Fat City is over, although many are still trying to milk it for the last bit of cream; we call these asshats "Vulture Capitalists," they feed off the dead and wounded). We must do more with less, and the rich must share or move out. We don't need more deadhead users and freeloaders. We must develop a mutually supportive community again. The business of government is the people's business; developers step to the rear. Legislators must renounce corporate campaign contributions as contrary to the public good. We must CONTROL land and resource value to discourage speculation, and eliminate or lessen the wide market swings due to nerves or manipulation. We must impose firm, honest value on land and resources and discourage speculative over-inflation – speculation is not bad per se, but it is one of the easiest activities to exaggerate and corrupt. We need a National Land Use Comprehensive Plan. Unlimited Growth is the ethos of a cancer cell, observes David Suzuki, noted biologist. Because one cannot personally conceive of an alternative to growth does not mean that one does not exist.

The world has failed to slow the accelerating extinction crisis despite years of international effort. It is hard to imagine a more important priority. The biodiversity of life on Earth comprises the ecosystems that provide climate regulation, food,fiber, clean water and air. Like a Dooms Day asteroid, human over-population, pollution, logging, over-exploitation, consumption, land use changes and engineering projects have produced the planet's sixth great extinction of species. Freshwater Species that live in lakes and rivers are vanishing four to six times faster than anywhere else. "There is clear and growing scientific evidence that we are on the verge of a major freshwater biodiversity crisis." We are in a life-threatening situation and must make fundamental and absolute changes without delay. We cannot give "just a bit more" to Trump and his greedy followers. Spoiled children need discipline in order to live wholesome, productive lives. Developers, energy barons, other planet-killers and we, must settle for less and work together to plan and build a healthy sustainable community. We require teamwork to endure what is coming.

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has long sought a repeal of the Obama-era rules.A three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 2-1 that the EPA would be allowed to reconsider a 2016 ruling that limited methane and smog-forming pollutants emitted by oil and gas wells, but could not delay the date it begins. Two judges concluded, "the administration record thus makes clear that industry groups had ample opportunity to comment on all four issues on which EPA granted reconsideration, and indeed, that in several instances the agency incorporated those comments directly into the final rule." READ MORE: Mining in Alaska may return as EPA scraps Obama-era regulationsPruitt, the new head of the EPA, had been looking to extend a suspension on these activities for two years. There will be a separate administration public hearing on the same extension next Monday, according to the Washington Post." he court's ruling is yet another reminder, now in the context of environmental protection, that the federal judiciary remains a significant obstacle to the president's desire to order immediate change," Richard Lazarus, environmental-law professor at Harvard Law School, said in an email as reported by the Post. Lazarus continued, "the DC Circuit's ruling today makes clear that neither the president nor his EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, can by fiat unilaterally and instantaneously repeal or otherwise stay the effectiveness of the environmental protection rules put into place during the Obama administration." Former President Barack Obama had put in place a rule in 2016 that was connected to a regulatory strategy which sought to reduce methane emissions. At the time, Pruitt was the Attorney General of Oklahoma and he and others sued the EPA to overturn the legislation. Pruitt has also begun to move on suspending or revoking many other measures which were implemented during the Obama years. This includes a two-year delay on a certain regulations aimed at minimizing chemical accidents.	True	False	False	False	False
687	The Huffington Post	left_bias	2017-10-23	Roy Moore Is An Outspoken Fundamentalist About Everything But Climate Change He's written poems lamenting legal abortion. He wants to make gay sex illegal and overturn marriage equality. The former judge says he places "God's law" above the Constitution, describes Islam as a "false religion" and has repeatedly defied federal orders to remove religious ornaments from his courtroom. He doesn't believe in evolution, compares preschool to Nazi-style indoctrination and once said the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks were divine punishment for the United States' godlessness. His campaign site calls for energy independence and stakes out the vague position: "Coal mining and oil drilling should be encouraged, subject only to reasonable regulations." In July, he was the only candidate to refuse to answer questions about climate change for a Montgomery Advertiser story. Katie Frost, his spokeswoman, did not respond to multiple requests for comment." ot only do scientists disagree on 'global warming,' but there is little hard evidence that carbon emissions cause changes to the global climate. But it appears that Obama and his liberal administration are not really interested in what the Constitution or the scientific community have to say when it interferes with their radical agenda." In fact, 97 percent of peer-reviewed scientists have found that climate change is a serious threat and is at least exacerbated by humans. And there are serious flaws in the studies published by the 3 percent of scientists whose research suggests otherwise. A research review published last November found errors in the methodologies, assumptions or analyses used by in those studies that, when fixed, put the findings in line with mainstream climate scientists. That consensus is so strong that in 2005 one of the standard-bearers of the evangelical Christian politics in which Moore enshrouds himself planned to take a stance affirming the science. That year, the National Association of Evangelicals proposed adopting a new platform called "For the Health of a Nation." The position paper called for protecting God's creation and embracing the government's help in doing so. But after receiving unanimous support by the board, the 30-million-member organization voted down the proposal, kickstarting a campaign by fossil fuel interests to transform the doubt over global warming into what Splinter, in a lengthy report published in August, succinctly described as "the word of God." White evangelical Christians, more than 80 percent of whom supported Trump in last November's election, are the least likely of any U.S. religious group to believe climate change is occurring, according to 2015 data from the Pew Research Center. Just 28 percent of white evangelicals believe the planet is warming primarily due to human activity, compared with 56 percent of black Protestants and 41 percent of white mainline Protestants who say the opposite. Roughly 37 percent of white evangelicals don't believe the climate is changing at all. This is a demographic Moore, who attends the Gallant First Baptist Church near his home, seems likely to tap. Alabama has the highest percentage of Baptists after Tennessee, with 31 percent of residents in the state, according to Pew's 2014 Religious Landscape study. In December, The Baptist Press, the official media arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, published an open letter of support for Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt's nomination amid fierce backlash over the former Oklahoma attorney general's rejection of the scientific consensus on climate change. On one side of that debate is a theological argument that's gained prominence in some corners of evangelical Christianity over the past decade. According to that interpretation, God provided fossil fuels for humans to exploit, and Christian environmentalists who believed in shifting to renewable energy were deceived by the "false doctrine" of the so-called "Green Dragon," a demonic force that fooled people into putting the needs of the planet ahead of those of the poor." s a Christian, I have a responsibility to try my best to be as wealthy as possible," James Wanliss, an associate professor of physics at Presbyterian College in South Carolina and the author of The Green Dragon: Is Global Warming a Religion?, told HuffPost. "If you're grindingly poor, you're just going to care about your next meal, and too bad if trees get in your way." I see that some of the anthropogenic global warming rhetoric has been picked up by people who are really excited about trying to experiment with those types of systems in the West as a solution to those problems," Wanliss said. "As a Christian, that's a problem to me, because, well, aside from the philosophy behind those systems, it's just, again, empirically been disastrous." Roy Moore, he's part of that culture," Michael Hansen, executive director of the Birmingham-based environmental group Gasp and a former candidate in the Democratic primary for Senate, told HuffPost. "Something that I hear quite a bit from the right wing in Alabama is that God gave us fossil fuels for a reason. I wouldn't be surprised if Roy Moore said that at some point during his campaign." Alabama emerged in June from more than a year of "the worst drought in memory," affecting 98 percent of the state. The state braced twice in the past month for damage from the devastating series of hurricanes that struck neighboring states, but it was spared the destruction after the winds weakened. Yet nearly 37 percent of Alabamians don't believe global warming is happening, 7 percentage points below the national average, according to survey data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.

472	cnn	left_bias	2018-11-23	Climate change brings dire consequences to the US, federal report concludes (CNN) A new US government report delivers a dire warning about climate change and its devastating impacts, saying the economy could lose hundreds of billions of dollars -- or, in the worst-case scenario, more than 10% of its GDP -- by the end of the century. The federally mandated study was supposed to come out in December but was released by the Trump administration on Friday, at a time when many Americans are on a long holiday weekend, distracted by family and shopping." The global average temperature is much higher and is rising more rapidly than anything modern civilization has experienced, and this warming trend can only be explained by human activities," Easterling said. Coming from the US Global Change Research Program , a team of 13 federal agencies, the Fourth National Climate Assessment was put together with the help of 1,000 people, including 300 leading scientists, roughly half from outside the government. Without significant reductions in greenhouse emissions, the annual average global temperature could increase 9 degrees Fahrenheit (5 Celsius) or more by the end of this century, compared with preindustrial temperatures, the report says. The costs of climate change could reach hundreds of billions of dollars annually, according to the report. The Southeast alone will probably lose over a half a billion labor hours by 2100 due to extreme heat. Farmers will face extremely tough times. The quality and quantity of their crops will decline across the country due to higher temperatures, drought and flooding. In parts of the Midwest, farms will be able to produce less than 75% of the corn they produce today, and the southern part of the region could lose more than 25% of its soybean yield. Heat stress could cause average dairy production to fall between 0.60% and 1.35% over the next 12 years -- having already cost the industry $1.2 billion from heat stress in 2010. Wildfire seasons -- already longer and more destructive than before -- could burn up to six times more forest area annually by 2050 in parts of the United States. Burned areas in Southwestern California alone could double by 2050. Dependable and safe water for the Hawaii, the Caribbean and others are threatened by these rising temperatures. Along the US coasts, public infrastructure and $1 trillion in national wealth held in real estate are threatened by rising sea levels, flooding and storm surges. Energy systems will be taxed, meaning more blackouts and power failures, and the potential loss in some sectors could reach hundreds of billions of dollars per year by the end of the century, the report said. The number of days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit will multiply; Chicago, where these days are rare, could start to resemble Phoenix or Las Vegas, with up to two months worth of these scorching-hot days. Sea levels have already gone up 7 to 8 inches since 1900. Almost half that rise has been since 1993, a rate of rise greater than during any century in the past 2,800 years. Some countries are already seeing land underwater. By midcentury, it's likely that the Arctic will lose all sea ice in late summer, and that could lead to more permafrost thaw, according to the report. As the permafrost thaws, more carbon dioxide and methane would be released, amplifying human-induced warming, "possibly significantly." What can be doneThe report was created to inform policy-makers and makes no specific recommendations on how to remedy the problem. However, it suggests that if the United States immediately reduced its fossil fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions, it could save thousands of lives and generate billions of dollars in benefits for the country. Reactions to the new report have been strong across the scientific community." In Houston, communities of color have endured back to back major weather events without the acknowledgment from Washington that climate change is the cause. We've known for years that it's true and it's important to our organizing and our local policy efforts that information like this is not only considered, but believed and acted upon." Scientists who have been raising the alarm about the negative consequences of climate change for years welcomed the findings.	True	False	False	False	True

The country set records for newly installed capacity of wind power in both the second and third quarters of 2019, according to a report by the American Wind Energy Association, reaching a total of 100 gigawatts —roughly on a par with nuclear plants, although in terms of actual power generated (as distinguished from theoretical capacity), wind is still a fraction of nuclear and fossil fuels." ind now supplies clean and efficient power to the equivalent of 32 million American homes, sustains 500 U.S. factories, and delivers more than $1 billion a year in new revenue to rural communities and states," Tom Kernan, CEO of AWEA, said in a statement. At a time when global carbon emissions that cause climate change continue to rise, wind power now accounts for 6.5 percent of the energy America produces. Once the wind turbines are constructed, the energy they produce is carbon neutral and renewable indefinitely. Yet Trump, who believes that climate change is a "hoax," is no fan of windmills, as he once again made clear last weekend in a speech in Florida." e'll have an economy based on wind. I never understood wind. You know, I know windmills very much. I've studied it better than anybody. I know it's very expensive. They're made in China and Germany mostly — very few made here, almost none. But they're manufactured tremendous — if you're into this — tremendous fumes," Trump asserted. "Gases are spewing into the atmosphere. You know we have a world, right? So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything. You talk about the carbon footprint — fumes are spewing into the air. Right? Spewing. Whether it's in China, Germany, it's going into the air. It's our air, their air, everything — right? So they make these things and then they put them up." Trump, who filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against the government of Scotland to block the construction of offshore wind turbines he said would mar the views from one of his golf resorts, also complained in his Florida speech that wind turbines killed birds." o under a windmill someday, you'll see more birds than you've ever seen ever in your life," Trump said. While it is true that an estimated 234,000 birds die each year in collisions with wind turbines, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, many more are killed by flying into buildings or by domestic cats. In 2018, the Trump administration eliminated criminal penalties for unintentional migratory bird deaths resulting from industrial or agricultural activity, the New York Times reported. Despite the rapid growth in the construction of wind power facilities across the U.S., the Interior Department announced in August that it was withholding approval for a wind project off the coast of Massachusetts similar to the one Trump opposed in Scotland. Interior Department spokesman Nicholas Goodwin said in a statement that the government needed to make sure the project was "safe and environmentally responsible." In April, Trump, without citing any evidence, told a Republican audience that wind turbines were dangerous to human health." hey say the noise causes cancer," Trump said. That claim, like all the others Trump has made about wind power, was quickly refuted." he American Cancer Society is unaware of any credible evidence linking the noise from windmills to cancer," a spokesman for the group told the Times in an email.• None Behind Pelosi's risky strategy to withhold impeachment from Senate• None What happens to the articles of impeachment now?• None Trump impeachment FAQ: What you need to know	False	False	False	False	True
619	TheBlaze	right_bias	2017-09-19	New analysis disputes the theory that climate change was responsible for Harvey and Irma In a new study, economist and environmental analyst Nicholas Loris explained that climate change simply isn't responsible for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. Bottom line, Loris's analysis stated that "man-made warming" was not responsible for Harvey and Irma." an-made warming did not cause Harvey and Irma," Loris wrote. "As carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions have increased, there have been no trends in global tropical cycle landfalls." Loris said that the "average number of hurricanes per decade reaching landfall in the U.S. has fallen over the past 160 years." He added that the study is based on concrete "mainstream science," and cited reports from The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and NOAA to corroborate his analysis. Loris also disputed assertions that global warming "supercharged" these hurricanes, which made them deadlier, citing work by University of Washington climatologist Cliff Mass and former director of the National Hurricane Center Bill Read, both of whom rejected this claim after conducting research into the phenomenon. With the eastern seaboard still in the thick of hurricane season (as well as the most recent devastation caused by Category 5 Hurricane Maria, which was said to "cripple" Dominica with "widespread devastation" en route to Puerto Rico and possibly the States), it's important to maintain levelheaded perspective and communication on natural disasters while speaking truth amidst apprehension. In a hyper-political environment, pro-climate change and anti-climate change theory rhetoric serves only to distract from the real issue at hand: the necessity of serving people impacted by natural disasters, and the implementation of standardized response to these crises. While much of the media and government is ensconced in creating division among political parties and ideologies, it's more important to avoid playing into alarmist rhetoric, which only serves to "encourage" people through anxiety and panic. Instead of focusing on the apprehension and divisiveness surrounding the causes of natural disasters, it's more important than ever that we maintain our humanity and come together to help one another.

The global workplace startup told employees this week that the company will ban employees from expensing meals that contain red meat, pork or poultry, Bloomberg reported. The company won't provide meat for events at its 400 locations, either — part of an effort to reduce its environmental footprint." New research indicates that avoiding meat is one of the biggest things an individual can do to reduce their personal environmental impact, even more than switching to a hybrid car," WeWork co-founder Miguel McKelvey said in an email to staffers. The no-meat policy will also affect self-serve food kiosks at many of WeWork's 400 locations worldwide, according to Bloomberg. Employees wanting "medical or religious" exceptions can hash those out with a company policy team. More: As co-working grows up, niche spaces take center stageWeWork boasts 6,000 employees worldwide, according to Bloomberg. The company estimates its no-meat policy will save 15,507,103 animals by 2023, according to Business Insider, along with 16.6 billion gallons of water and 445.1 million pounds of carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping gas that alters Earth's climate. WeWork confirmed the policy change to both news outlets. WeWork is perhaps the most well-known company to emerge offering co-working spaces to freelancers, small businesses and even employees of large companies such as Microsoft.

487	bbc	left_center_bias	2018-11-23	Climate change: Report warns of growing impact on US life Unchecked climate change will cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars and damage human health and quality of life, a US government report warns." Future risks from climate change depend... on decisions made today," the 4th National Climate Assessment says. The report says climate change is "presenting growing challenges to human health and safety, quality of life, and the rate of economic growth". The warning is at odds with the Trump administration's fossil fuels agenda. During a blast of icy weather in Washington this week, Donald Trump tweeted, "whatever happened to global warming?"Now, without mentioning the president, his own scientists have answered their boss's question in comprehensive detail. Global warming is here in the United States, they say - now. It is already deadly serious and without urgent, dramatic change, it will be catastrophic. This report is striking for two reasons. First, it is not abstract. It gives many specific examples - overwhelmed dams in South Carolina; failing crops in the parched Great Plains; a rise in insect-borne disease in Florida. And, secondly, it majors on the economic impact, in effect challenging the White House's insistence on prioritising economic growth over environmental regulation. With warnings about the effects on crumbling infrastructure, falling crop yields and decreasing labour productivity, the report sounds an alarm that climate change will soon cascade into every corner of American life. The White House said the report - compiled with help from numerous US government agencies and departments - was inaccurate. Spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said it was "largely based on the most extreme scenario, which contradicts long-established trends by assuming that... there would be limited technology and innovation, and a rapidly expanding population". The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is human-induced and warn that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity. The US climate assessment outlines the prospective impacts of climate change across every sector of American society." With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century - more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many US states," the report says." Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century." The report notes that the effects of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country, including more frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events. But it says that projections of future catastrophe could change if society works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and "to adapt to the changes that will occur". Environmental groups said the report underlined their demands for action. Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists and one of the report's authors, said the report made it clear that climate change was not "some problem in the distant future"." It's happening right now in every part of the country," she said. That view was echoed by Abigail Dillen, president of environmental group Earthjustice." While President Trump continues to ignore the threat of climate change, his own administration is sounding the alarm," she said. In October, President Trump accused climate change scientists of having a "political agenda", telling Fox News he was unconvinced that humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures. After taking office he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures "well below" 2C above pre-industrial levels. At the time, Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new "fair" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers. During his election campaign in 2016 Mr Trump said climate change was "a hoax". However he has since rowed back on that statement saying in a recent interview: "I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference."A report released in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading international body evaluating climate change - said it could only be stopped if the world made major, and costly, changes. That means reducing global emissions of CO2 by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reducing coal use to almost zero and using up to seven million sq km (2.7 million square miles) for land energy crops. If the world fails to act, the researchers warned, there would be some significant and dangerous changes to our world, including rising sea levels, significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat.

270	breitbart	questionable_source	2019-09-07	Joe Biden Promises Environmentalist: 'Look into My Eyes; I Guarantee You, We Are Going to End Fossil Fuel' Biden took questions from a group in New Castle, New Hampshire, Friday. One woman associated with the environmental group 350 New Hampshire Action, Rebecca Beaulieu, asked Biden how voters can trust him if he continues to associate himself with fossil fuel executives." ow can we trust that you're going to act on climate — on the climate crisis — if you're still attending fundraisers that fossil fuel executives are attending?" Beaulieu asked, according to the Daily Mail. Video shows Biden walking over to the woman, taking her hand, and making a solemn promise to "end fossil fuel … before 2050, God willing." Kiddo, I want you to just take a look. I want you to look into my eyes," Biden began."  guarantee you, I guarantee you, we are going to end fossil fuel, and I am not going to cooperate with them. Before 2050, God willing," Biden continued, adding that 2030 is not a realistic goal:No it can't be done by 2030. No, not one single person is arguing it can be done by that. But it can be done by 2050. Maybe 2045? And is the science increases, we may be able to move more quickly. But we have to we can fundamentally change things in the next 10 years, though, so that we set a path? I promise you, I promise you. OK. Beaulieu, 24, said she "wasn't expecting" that kind of response from Biden and described it as "patronizing." Just a little patronizing, because I want to be an adult at the table when it comes to conversations about climate, and what we're going to do about it, and I don't want to be like someone who's sitting on the sidelines waiting for other people to act," she said, according to the Daily Mail." 'm also like actively doing something to try to combat this climate crisis as it stands. Being called a kid is a little patronizing when I'm trying to do so much work," she added. She also said she was unsatisfied with Biden's refusal to bend his 2050 goal." ut I hope that he takes the climate crisis as seriously as he tried to make it seem and that if he's going to keep moving forward with his plans, he needs to reevaluate because 2050 is too late," she said. Biden recently came under fire for attending a fundraiser hosted by Andrew Goldman, a founder of the natural gas company Western LNG. The former vice president dismissed concerns, telling viewers of CNN's climate change town hall Wednesday that Goldman is "not a fossil fuel executive." He is not a fossil fuel executive," Biden said. "And the fact of the matter is that — what we talk about is, what are we going to do about those corporations? What have we done?""And everywhere along the way — for example, I've argued and pushed for us suing those executives who are engaged in pollution, those companies engaged in pollution," he added. "I've never walked away from that."	False	False	True	False	False
551	theguardian	left_center_bias	2018-02-20	'Sloppy and careless': courts call out Trump blitzkrieg on environmental rules In its first year in office, the Trump administration introduced a solitary new environmental rule aimed at protecting the public from pollution. It was aimed not at sooty power plants or emissions-intensive trucks, but dentists. Every year, dentists fill Americans' tooth cavities with an amalgam that includes mercury. About 5 tons of mercury, a dangerous toxin that can taint the brain and the nervous system, are washed away from dental offices down drains each year. In Trump's first day in the White House, the administration told the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to withdraw an Obama-era plan that would require dentists to prevent this mercury from getting into waterways. But in June, the rule was unexpectedly enacted. This apparent change of heart followed legal action filed by green groups, part of a cascade of courtroom standoffs that are starting to slow and even reverse the Trump administration's blitzkrieg of environmental regulations." he Trump administration has been sloppy and careless, they've shown significant disrespect for rule of law and courts have called them on it," said Richard Revesz, a professor at the New York University school of law."  expect we will see a number of further losses for the administration on similar grounds. If they keep showing the same disregard for the law, their attempt to repeal all these environmental regulations will go badly for them." The reversal of Obama's environmental legacy has been spearheaded by Scott Pruitt, who heads the EPA, the agency he repeatedly sued as Oklahoma attorney general. Pruitt, who accused Obama of "bending the rule of law" and federal overreach, has overseen the methodical delay or scrapping of dozens of rules curbing pollution from power plants, pesticides and vehicles. Ironically for Pruitt, who has touted a "back to basics" approach rooted safely within the confines of the law, this rapidly executed agenda has run into a thicket of legal problems, causing the administration to admit defeat in several cases. In July, a federal court ruled that the EPA couldn't suspend rules designed to curb methane emissions from new oil and gas wells. This was followed by a hasty retreat in August when the EPA agreed to not delay new standards to reduce smog-causing air pollutants, the day after 15 states and environment groups sued. Then, in December, a federal court told the EPA it couldn't delay a new standard for dangerous levels of lead in paint and dust. Other arms of the federal government have also been stymied from implementing Trump's deregulatory agenda. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, stung by a lawsuit, listed the rusty patched bumblebee as endangered in March after initially delaying the decision. And on Thursday, a federal court told the department of energy it must implement four energy efficiency regulations it was looking to scuttle. Many of these legal problems have stemmed from the sheer pace of the rollbacks – required public comment periods have been set aside in some cases, any rationale for repeal or delay has been missing in others. Opponents of the administration also believe there is a determination to expunge every vestige of Obama's environmental legacy, regardless of merit." hey are trying to score political points or attempting to grant favours to corporations who don't want to follow the rules," said Aaron Colangelo, the litigation director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. "It all shows that this administration won't protect the environment unless they are sued. They have been reckless and not followed the basic requirements of the law." The EPA now faces a fresh wave of opposition as it looks to craft replacements for major Obama rules such as the clean power plan, which sought to limit emissions from coal-fired power plants, and the waters of the US rule, which greatly expanded clean water protections. If the proposed replacements are, as expected, far less onerous on industry than current iterations, environmentalists and around a dozen states, headed by New York and California, will be poised to further jam up the process in the courts." ver and over again, the Trump administration has put the profits of multinational polluters over the health and well-being of everyday Americans," said Eric Schneiderman, New York's attorney general. Schneiderman has been prolific in opposing Trump's environmental revisions, filing more than 50 lawsuits during the administration's first year to, among other things, protect the clean power plan, enforce stricter vehicle pollution standards and ensure that chlorpyrifos, a common pesticide linked to neurological harm to children, is banned." e've already beaten back several of this administration's toxic policies, from energy efficiency rollbacks to smog," Schneiderman said. "Our fight to protect public health and our environment will continue in court."	True	False	True	False	False
639	TheBlaze	right_bias	2017-06-03	John Kerry makes bogus claims against Trump for pulling out of Paris Agreement In an interview on MSNBC on Thursday, former Secretary of State John Kerry said President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord "puts America last," is "shameful" and will hurt kids by worsening their asthma." t is a shameful moment for the United States, to have unilaterally walked away from an agreement which did not have one other country requiring us to do something," Kerry told Andrea Mitchell. "It was a voluntary program … The president was not truthful with the American people today, and the president who talked about putting America first, has now put America last." Kerry claimed Trump is not helping the "forgotten American." Trump "is not helping the forgotten American," Kerry said. "He is hurting them. Their kids will have worse asthma in the summer. They will have a harder time having economic growth. He's made us an environmental pariah in the world, and I think it is one of the most self-destructive moves I've ever seen by any president in my lifetime." Kerry's primary arguments that Trump's decision will hurt kids with asthma and damage the economy were incredibly misleading. A 2015 study by researcher Dr. Corrine Keet at John's Hopkins Children Center found no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of asthma for kids living in inner-city areas, where there is much more air pollution, and kids who live in the suburbs and rural areas. More than 23,000 children were included in the study. Daniel Simmons, the vice president for policy at the Institute for Energy Research, noted in a quote appearing in an article by E&E News that asthma rates have been steadily worsening even though air quality has been improving." ir quality has been increasing, pollution has been decreasing, things are getting better and asthma's getting worse," Simmons said. "You have this disconnect." In 2013, USA Today reported that Earth's warming climate has caused pollen season to increase, thereby exacerbating many people's asthma. If climate change is being caused by human-produced carbon-dioxide, this could lend support to Kerry's claim about asthma. Of course, scientists disagree over what has caused Earth's climate to warm over the past century, and, perhaps most importantly, increased pollen comes from increased plant growth and, as a result, increased crop yields. Should more plants and food for people and animals really be demonized?Kerry's argument that Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement will cause economic problems is equally absurd. Kerry cited in the interview the "millions" of renewable-energy jobs that have been created to help curb carbon-dioxide emissions as an example of how the Paris Agreement and its associated efforts would have a positive impact on the economy, but the truth is that the only reason the wind and solar energy industries have been able to survive is because they are heavily subsidized by taxpayers. Further, wind and solar are much more expensive forms of energy, which means Americans' power bills would continue to rise under the terms of the Paris Climate Agreement. As H. Sterling Burnett, a research fellow in climate and energy issues for The Heartland Institute, where I also work as executive editor and a research fellow, noted in a recent article on Trump's decision, "Numerous studies, including a NERA Economic Consulting report cited in Trump's announcement, showed meeting the carbon-dioxide targets imposed on the United States under the Paris agreement would force the premature closing of many of the nation's least-expensive power plants. NERA estimated meeting the nation's obligations under the agreement would cost the U.S. economy nearly $3 trillion, and by 2040, the United States would have lost 6.5 million industrial-sector jobs, including 3.1 million manufacturing jobs."

379	thedailycaller	right_bias	2018-10-30	North Carolina Gov Roy Cooper Says New Green Policies Will 'Lessen The Impact' Of Hurricanes North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper signed an executive order Monday he says is meant to "combat climate change" and "lessen the impact of future natural disasters," like hurricanes. Cooper's order requires state agencies to encourage people to buy more electric vehicles, use more wind and solar energy, and cut energy use at state-owned buildings. Cooper also asked agencies to promote "climate adaptation" and green energy use, including wind and solar."  strong clean energy economy combats climate change while creating good jobs and a healthy environment," said Cooper. "With historic storms lashing our state, we must combat climate change, make our state more resilient and lessen the impact of future natural disasters." The order comes more than one month after Hurricane Florence dumped record amounts of rainfall over the Carolinas after making landfall as a Category 1 storm. Florence dumped 11 trillion gallons of rain over the Carolinas, causing devastating floods and taking more than 50 lives. Democrats and environmentalists claimed the storm was made worse by man-made global warming. Some scientists said warm waters "supercharged" Florence and sea level rise made storm surge significantly worse. (RELATED: Al Gore Wades Into A Bitter Battle Over The Fate Of Fracking In Colorado)However, not all scientists agreed. Cato Institute atmospheric scientist Ryan Maue pointed out that Florence formed over "abnormally cool" ocean waters, then weakened over cooler waters — the opposite of what forecasters expected." here is no reason to suggest that global warming or an 'ocean heat wave' supercharged Hurricane Florence," University of Washington climate scientist Cliff Mass said in September.

"So the 'ocean heat wave' theory is obviously bogus." Mass also said that "most of the major impacts of the storm was because it slowed down near the coast, causing an extended period of rain." He added there's "no credible theory of observational evidence that such slowing down has anything to do with global warming." While scientists predict continued global warming could make future hurricanes more intense, the latest United Nations climate report found that many studies showed a "decreasing trend in the global number of tropical cyclones and/or the globally accumulated cyclonic energy." Cooper, however, says his executive order will make North Carolina "more resilient and lessen the impact of future natural disasters" by putting more electric vehicles on the road and cutting emissions. But even if Cooper's plan achieves its goal of cutting state greenhouse gas emissions, it would have virtually no impact on projected global warming, based on climate model simulations. For example, the Obama administration's pledge to cut U.S. emissions 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 was only projected to avert 0.001 degrees Celsius of projected global warming a year. If that's the impact on future temperatures cutting emissions for the entire country would have, North Carolina's emissions cuts would have an even less significant impact.

700	CNN	left_bias	2017-09-13	Trump administration doesn't want to talk about climate change Last year was the Earth's warmest recorded year, the third year in a row to set a new record for global average temperatures. Rising temperatures are likely to increase the intensity and impact of major storms, scientists say, yet in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the Trump administration has resisted talking about climate change at all. Several key administration officials have been on message this week declining to discuss the issue and how to address the causes of global warming and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget, said climate change is a "longer discussion on another day" and a "big topic for the media." I'll be more than happy to have a longer discussion on another day about climate change, man-made climate change," Mulvaney told CNN's Jake Tapper on "The Lead" Wednesday." What we are focusing on right now is taking care of the folks who survived this disaster who need our immediate help," he said. "There's plenty of time later on to have those discussions, and I know we will because climate change is clearly a big topic for the media, but we will continue to focus our attention on the folks who need it right now." Both FEMA administrator Brock Long and acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke avoided explicitly answering in CNN interviews Tuesday whether the government needs to be more focused on climate change because of hurricanes such as Harvey and Irma. Both instead said the focus needs to be on preparedness and resiliency. "Regardless of what causes disasters, it's our job within the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA to manage the consequences," Long told CNN. "The only way we become resilient as a nation is we have to create that true culture of preparedness among our citizenry, which we do not have, and then we also have to look how we move forward when it comes to infrastructure protection." Duke echoed Long's thoughts on the need for "resiliency," a term frequently used during the administration's storm response. "We live in a changing world, and as the FEMA administrator said, we always have to look at not just the response, but the preparedness and the resilience," said Duke. "And I think it's important that as we come together as a country, we look at the changes in our world and make sure that in planning and response, that we are adapting properly." Pushed about whether the administration should also be looking at the cause of the storm, Duke responded "I -- you know, the data, I don't know what it particularly indicates. We haven't had a major storm like this in a quite a while." Duke added that she had to talk to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration about whether the storms were an "anomaly year or a trend year." Global warming will likely cause tropical cyclones to intensify on average globally and add to a larger potential for destruction according to NOAA Tom Bossert, White House adviser on Homeland Security, was equally remiss to talk about the likely causes of the two hurricanes at a White House briefing Monday. "Causality is something outside of my ability to analyze right now," he said. "There's a cyclical nature to a lot of these hurricanes. We continue to take seriously the climate change, not the cause of it, but the things we observe." He added that the White House would have to perform a "trend analysis" in the future -- insinuating that hurricane systems are cyclical and not tied to global warming. President Donald Trump, who pulled the US out of the Paris climate accords earlier this year, has previously called global warming a "hoax." When asked whether Trump's personal opinion on climate change has changed at all, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said, "I don't think that it's changed over the last several weeks," adding that she remains unsure whether the President is reconsidering the Paris deal following the hurricanes. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt told CNN in an interview about Hurricane Irma on Thursday that the time to talk about climate change isn't now -- saying the question was "insensitive." "Here's the issue," Pruitt said. "To have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm; versus helping people, or actually facing the effect of the storm, is misplaced." In addition to the administration's efforts to wipe mention of climate change from the federal agency websites, it has proposed cutting EPA funding intended to assist coastal communities in preparing for the impacts of climate change as well as rolled back regulations meant to advise on building against rising sea levels.

297	breitbart	questionable_source	2019-02-12	Eric Garcetti Declares 'Green New Deal' in L.A., Cancels Natural Gas Plants; Officials Doubt 'Keeping the Lights On' Instead, the city will look for energy from renewable sources, including wind and solar, he decided." his is the Green New Deal … Not in concept, not in the future, but now," Garcetti said, as quoted by the Los Angeles Times. He made the decision despite the fact that "top staffers have argued in recent months that the gas plants are critical to keeping the lights on in the city," the Times noted. The term "Green New Deal" refers to a bill introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) last week, which proposes moving the entire U.S. economy to renewable energy in the next ten years. The plan also aims to provide every American with a guaranteed "job with a family-sustaining wage, adequate family and medical leave, paid vacations, and retirement security to all people." The bill does not explain how those benefits will be paid for, nor how the renewable energy goals will be achieved, given that renewables currently provide less than 20% of the country's energy. Environmentalists are also opposed to using one of those renewable sources, hydroelectric power, because of concerns about environmental damage caused by dams. California has a law already in place mandating a shift to 100% renewable sources — but by 2045, not 2030. It is not clear how the state will achieve that goal. In his comments, Garcetti slammed natural gas as an energy source: "[N]ow is the time to start the beginning of the end of natural gas." Ironically, the switch from coal to natural gas over the past decade has enabled the U.S. economy to grow while reducing emissions over the long run. "More gas for electricity has been our most effective weapon at combating climate change," wrote RealClearEnergy editor Jude Clemente last year. Garcetti pledged to replace L.A.'s natural gas plants with wind and solar energy, but offered no plans describing how the city would do so, nor whether it would be able to meet the energy needs of an expanding city. Southern California already struggles to provide electricity to consumers during heat waves, when air conditioning use is at a maximum, and prices soar. In addition, utilities have begun shutting down power lines during high winds for fear of starting wildfires. During a natural gas leak in Porter Ranch in 2016, L.A. authorities worried that the temporary closure of one natural gas plant could lead to power outages. Nevertheless, Eric Garcetti was bullish on a future without fossil fuels — even without a plan to replace them. The mayor said he had challenged the city's Department of Water and Power to come up with an answer: "Instead of saying all the reasons why not, get to a reason as to why." Garcetti will leave office in 2022. The first of the three plants to be replaced will be retired in 2024. Joel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.

308	theduran	questionable_source	2019-06-22	India is drying up. A return of the water wars Chennai is out of water, all 4 reservoirs are dry. More than 8.5 million live in greater Chennai, so it's about the population of greater San Francisco. An India government think tank predicts that by 2030, 600 million Indians won't have sufficient drinking water. It's kind of amazing that they didn't see this coming long ago and plan better. And even 2030 wouldn't help right now, which is what is needed. Rain is the solution, but that's not exactly a sure thing when you are in the middle of a historic drought. Little that can be done right now, except to keep on hauling water in from wherever they can. Many more will follow, in part, because people consider water to be a gift from God. People of India consume lots of water. If the price of water was higher they would consume less and there would be money available to search for new sources of water. The problem is when people think a resource is free and so plentiful that it can never run out that you get situations where it does run out. Clean water has a value. People should be paying what it costs to create and conserve or store fresh water. Regarding the price of water. Pricing will now have to include the risk of drought. The risk of drought is going up rapidly all over the world. I expect that India will need to invest in sea water desalination. That isn't cheap but whatever it costs, those costs have to be passed on to the consumers. The rain and drought situation in India is grim. Most of the Indian cities, towns and villages are reeling under severe water crisis. A tragedy is unfolding in Maharashtra and a money spinning racket for Tanker owners. Drought in more than forth of Maharashtra. Crores of rupees of the tax-payers money will be used for tankers that will cause incredible pollution in the rural areas…. Creation of many lakes all over the country to catch and store rain water is a primary objective. Water balancing between various rivers, the so called "River Linking" Project is the second alternative. Once water is available in every village, the distribution to houses can be taken up as the third step. Traditional systems perhaps might have to be tweeked a little according to the needs and changing times but there is so much to learn from those who came before us. Village Talab system, is one example. When pond of one village was overflowed, water was released for next village on slopes. Rainwater was harvested at home. In Junagadh, Ahmedabad, Cambay cities. I am not sure whether anyone in Tamil Nadu even knows it had a traditional water harvesting system. Similarly, Odisha's traditional 'Kutta and Munda' water harvesting system by an NGO some decades back but I doubt if any university in Odisha is working on it or the State government is trying to revive the dying wisdom. This is true for all other states, barring Karnataka which is trying to bring back the Kalyani water harvesting structures. Reviving traditional water bodies and harvesting systems has been talked for quite sometime but no one seems interested. The largest desalination plant in South Asia is at Chennai, one of two there. It produces 36.5 million cubic meters/year. That's 9.6 billion US gallons. Israel gets the majority of its drinking water from desalination. It has the world's largest plant, at Hadera, producing 127 cubic meters from salt water, plus it looks like it has larger plants as well. That 33.5 billion gallons. Chennai has a large desalination plant, and a smaller one. Their policies are insufficient in many ways. Like what is water used for, etc. Regulations on ground water pumping, etc. I don't know specifics, but do know that if a city this size runs out of water, several people didn't do their jobs. Areas that are dry are becoming drier and those that are wet are getting more rain. But some of them have drier soil due to increased temperatures. The entire region from Syria to Iran has been suffering a drought that has been going on for about 15 years. At some point somebody has to call a spade a spade and accept the fact that the drought is the new normal. Seeding clouds can only bring as much rain as there is water in the atmosphere. Global climate change is, in turn, changing the distribution of where water is accumulating. At the least, we must improve our water distribution systems to mitigate the problem. Seeding is only a short term solution. Build nuclear and desalinate-Although there is no way nuclear can be added fast enough to by itself desalinate drinking water for 600 million by 2030. And India hasn't signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. What are the chances India uses geoengineering? The public: no tests, no international treaties, that will stop it. Geoengineering is cheap and not rocket science.A recent study indicates that almost nowhere will suffer under geoengineering. More studies are needed. The most likely is distributing air pollution in the stratosphere.I doubt that India will concern itself with niceties of international cooperation. Or whichever country leads the way. That's why there has been a campaign for more than a decade: test and make treaties. But we were busy.	False	True	False	False	False
643	NewsBusters	right_bias	2017-10-05	New Magic School Bus to Kids: Use Clean Energy or Monsters Will Eat You The Magic School Bus is back in the new Netflix series The Magic School Bus Rides Again!  Overall, it's still a nice, fun 13-episode series like we remember from when we were kids, but with some left turns. There is a pretty predictable take on climate change propaganda for little kids, but that wasn't the worst. That dubious honor goes to the episode that teaches kids that a monster will eat them if they don't use alternative clean energy sources. In the show, Miss Frizzle takes her class on educational field trips with the help of a magical school bus that allow them to learn about things like magnets, allergies, and states of matter. In the original series, the kids were taught by Miss Valerie Felicity Frizzle (Lily Tomlin), who is now Professor Frizzle. She hands the charge of her classroom over to her sister, Miss Fiona Frizzle (voiced by Saturday Night Live's Kate McKinnon). Most of the episodes are innocuous enough. The kids have a scientific question of some kind in the classroom, and Miss Frizzle takes them to the Magic School Bus where an incredible field trip helps them to understand. This might be a trip to discover how different animals blend into their surroundings to hide from predators, how the brain coordinates different parts of the body, or what lies deep under the sea. But episode 10, "The Tales Glaciers Tell," is the first of two questionable episodes. Miss Frizzle's student Dorothy Ann (also known as D.A.) has been asked to join her storyteller parents in telling a story of her own for a crowd. However, she's more into data than storytelling, so the kids take a trip to a glacier, allowing her to tell the story of - you guessed it - climate change, which is met with a standing ovation by the audience. Really? This is what kids are getting excited about? I doubt it. Of course, conserving energy is a good thing and we should be kind to the earth, but this climate change hysteria is taking over. Usually, somebody will say that 97 percent of climate scientists agree that humans are causing global warming, and I was surprised that figure didn't come up in this episode. Could it be that they know how easily debunked that number is? Given the way Dorothy Ann presented man-made climate change as fact, I doubt it. This issue tends to play incredibly well in the mainstream media, as they use climate change as the universal bad-guy, so I'm sure there were plenty of parents who actually thought this episode was a good idea. I find it hard to believe any parents were happy about this next one, though. Episode 12, "Monster Power," teaches kids that a monster will eat them if they don't use alternative clean energy sources. Albert, one of the students, has seen a movie in which the evil monster loves pollution and is "coming for us next for what we've done to this planet!" With the class camping in the woods, Miss Frizzle and the other students help him come up with clean energy alternatives (wind, water, etc) so they won't be eaten. Instead, Miss Frizzle could tell him that monsters aren't real, but I guess that didn't occur to her. While it makes sense to teach kids the science of pollution and about all kinds of energy (I wouldn't have minded some talk about oil in the dinosaur episode, to be honest), why would they tell kids that a monster will eat them for using the wrong energy source? I may not have the teaching credentials of Miss Frizzle, but I'm pretty sure that's not scientifically accurate. They must really hate fossil fuels as much as their friends on the left. Keeping in mind that the TV-Y rating for this series means it's for kids 2-6, I'm sure there are going to be some parents pretty irked at bedtime when kids are scared of the blot monster. Overall, this is a cute series and fun bit of nostalgia for those of us who enjoyed the original books (or TV series) as kids, but I could have done without the climate change propaganda, and telling kids that traditional energy sources attract monsters is way over the top. Can't kids just learn without an anti-scientific social agenda?	False	False	False	True	False

The Trump Administration Is Ecstatic The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) broke a two-year partisan deadlock Thursday night to approve a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminal in Louisiana. Top Department of Energy (DOE) officials said this was a major breakthrough that will alleviate a growing problem for U.S. energy producers — a lack of export infrastructure." e have been promoting US energy around the world and today's decision by the FERC is a very important one," DOE Deputy Secretary Dan Brouillette told The Daily Caller News Foundation in an interview. (RELATED: US Oil Output Hits 12 Million Barrel-A-Day Milestone Way Ahead Of Schedule)The Calcasieu Pass LNG export terminal is the first such project to get FERC approval in two years. Republican FERC commissioners Neil Chatterjee, the chairman and Bernard McNamee worked with Democrat Cheryl LaFleur to hash out an agreement to get her support. Chatterjee and McNamee needed LaFleur's vote to approve Calcasieu Pass, which they secured after working out a new approach to account for greenhouse gas emissions from the export facility." his is a tremendous breakthrough," DOE Under Secretary of Energy Mark Menezes told TheDCNF. "We hope it will serve as an analytical template going forward." Once complete, Calcasieu Pass terminal will export up 12 million metric tons of LNG a year. Brouillette said the project already has buyers, including in Europe, waiting for American natural gas. Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling spurred an oil and natural gas boom over the past decade, making the U.S. the world's top hydrocarbon producer. However, a limiting factor on oil and gas is the lack of export terminals and pipelines. Menezes said breaking FERC's deadlock was also an important step in helping DOE improve its own LNG terminal approval process, including "making sure there's no duplicative reviews." Getting approval to build an LNG export terminal is a long, complicated process that requires approval from multiple agencies. FERC currently has a backlog of a dozen LNG projects awaiting approval. (RELATED: Obama EPA Regulations Blamed For Closure Of 100-Year-Old Coal Plant)The Trump administration has been pushing for speedier approvals for LNG terminals, but FERC has been holding up the process amid pressure from environmental groups to factor global warming into its approval process. LaFleur, for example, called on FERC to factor in estimates, like the controversial "social cost of carbon," for a cost-benefit analysis. However, LaFleur agreed to compromise with her Republican colleagues. FERC's other Democratic commissioner Richard Glick opposed the terminal, arguing his colleagues were "deliberately ignoring the consequences that its actions have for climate change." The commission's environmental review of Calcasieu Pass found the facility would emit roughly 3.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year — about 0.07 percent of total U.S. emissions. Brouillette argued that while an individual LNG export terminal would emit greenhouse gases, it would help lower global emissions because countries want gas as an alternative to coal." o the extent that LNG is displacing coal around the world, we think the impact is going to be positive," Brouillette said. Brouillette also stressed the geopolitical implications of LNG exports and the role energy could play in President Donald Trump's foreign policy." hese are decisions that impact the president's ability to make foreign policy decisions," Brouillette told TheDCNF. "We get to assist Poland, we get to assist Lithuania, we get to assist the Baltic states."

96	thehuffingtonpost	left_bias	2019-07-30	Detroiters March For Green New Deal Ahead Of Democratic Debate DETROIT ― Theresa Landrum survived her battle with cancer. But her parents didn't. Neither did at least 10 other people who lived on her block. Such is life and death in the 48217, Michigan's most polluted ZIP code ― home to automotive plants, the state's only oil refinery and more than 8,200 mostly working-class African Americans. On Tuesday, Landrum, a retired General Motors factory worker, marched downtown with as many as 2,000 fellow Detroiters to the steps of the Fox Theatre, where 10 Democratic presidential hopefuls were scheduled to face off in the second round of primary debates. The protest marked one of the most confrontational demands for a Green New Deal in months, as local groups took up the mantle from national climate campaigners, which have shifted their efforts to focus on demanding a climate-only Democratic primary debate. Amid the gleaming towers of automotive giants whose vehicles now spew the majority of America's climate-changing gases, the demonstrators called for a future in which the health of the planet and its people guides industrial planning and in which the Motor City sheds its association with combustion engines." e are being robbed and pillaged by industry," Landrum said, her voice rising to a preacher's righteous crescendo. "Then you know what we get? A few job promises, and they get to pollute as much as they want." The three-word slogan surged into America's political lexicon last November when activists with the youth-led Sunrise Movement occupied then-incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office, demanding Democrats champion climate policy that actually matches the scope of the crisis. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) took heed. In February, she and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) introduced a resolution that outlined the core tenets of a Green New Deal. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's growing inventory of policy proposals includes plans to decarbonize the military by 2030, halt fossil fuel leasing on public lands, and put new restrictions on businesses' ability to influence lawmakers. California Sen. Kamala Harris, the only candidate to bring up the Green New Deal in the first round of debates, co-sponsored a climate justice bill with Ocasio-Cortez this week that lays the groundwork for federal climate spending to benefit poor, minority communities who disproportionately suffer the impacts of pollution. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has yet to release a comprehensive climate plan, has positioned himself as the standard-bearer of former President Franklin D. Roosevelt's economic ideals, and a vocal proponent of the Green New Deal movement. Climate change received a combined 15 minutes of airtime during last month's debates in Miami ― woefully insufficient given the scope of the crisis, but significant progress for an issue that was virtually ignored in the 2016 election. But because the events were held in a city threatened by rising sea levels, debate questions focused on the magnitude of the global warming crisis and the risks posed by runaway emissions. The Frontline Detroit Coalition, the alliance of a dozen local environmental groups and unions who organized Tuesday's march, struck a markedly different tone. If Miami is a city in need of salvation from rising seas, Detroit, in their vision, could be the savior. Ahead of the march, musicians and activists took a makeshift stage in Cass Park, a historic green space where last month's record heatwave left the grass crisp and brown, and led crowds chanting "build a new economy" and "invest in our community." The Green New Deal is a platform, an empty box. It's not going to be fully ready until it begins to reflect the kind of environmental and energy issues that our people are concerned about," said Darryl Jordan, 65, the co-director of the East Michigan Environmental Action Council. "We're not in a state where the differences between Democrats and Republicans are that radical." If there is poetry in demanding a Green New Deal in the city that birthed the automotive age, the city's union legacy gives the call real teeth. Powerful construction unions that depend on the fossil fuel industry for lucrative jobs have publicly opposed the Green New Deal, though the movement has garnered growing labor support, including an official endorsement from the Service Employees International Union last month.

345	thedailycaller	right_bias	2018-08-04	EPA Released A Long-Delayed Report Showing Ethanol Hurts The Environment An extensive report from the Environmental Protection Agency found that including ethanol into the U.S. gas supply is wreaking havoc on the atmosphere and soil. In a study titled "Biofuels and the Environment: The Second Triennial Report to Congress," the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that ethanol derived from corn and soybeans is causing serious harm to the environment. Water, soil and air quality were all found to be adversely affected by biofuel mandates." vidence since enactment of [the Energy Independence and Security Act] suggests an increase in acreage planted with soybeans and corn, with strong indications from observed changes in land use that some of this increase is a consequence of increased biofuel production," read a portion of the 159-page report. The ethanol mandate has negatively effected water quality, with greater biofuel production resulting in more harmful algae blooms and hypoxia. While most algae is harmless to water, some forms — such as the kind produced in Lake Eerie from biofuel feedstock — has emitted toxic chemicals into the water. This harmful algae can consume the oxygen in the water, a process known as hypoxia, killing other wildlife. Increased irrigation — fueled by growing demand for ethanol — has also taken a toll on the ground, with the report finding "grassland-to-annual-crop conversion negatively impacts soil quality because it increases erosion and the loss of soil nutrients." Essentially, the study found that biofuel mandates are boosting production of corn and soybeans. Large-scale production of these crops is causing environmental degradation. The EPA also found that — at least in some instances — using ethanol in lieu of gasoline resulted in worse air emissions." A]ir quality modeling suggests that production and use of ethanol as fuel to displace gasoline is likely to increase such air pollutants as PM2.5, ozone, and SOx in some locations," read a section of the report pertaining to air quality. While traditional gasoline contains more CO2, ethanol-based fuels have more nitrogen oxides (NOx), which can be more harmful to human health. NOx can exacerbate asthma by causing inflammation of the respiratory airwaves, with long-term exposure resulting in decreased lung functionThe mandate in reference concerns the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a 2005 law that requires oil refineries include a certain amount of ethanol in their fuel mix. The law was passed with the intention of aiding in climate change efforts. The RFS has proven to be controversial, with oil producers deriding the mandate as costly and unneeded. Corn growers, however, support the mandate as it drives demand for the product. (RELATED: New EPA Chief Will Continue Scott Pruitt's War With The Corn Lobby)During his time leading the EPA, Scott Pruitt became an adversary of ethanol proponents after granting more RFS waivers and pushing for a rollback of the law altogether. It's not immediately clear how the Trump administration will handle the RFS debate moving forward. Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler has suggested he will continue seeking changes to the mandate, but President Donald Trump told an Iowa crowd in July that the EPA may soon allow for more ethanol to be included in gas. The EPA study, published on June 29, came after a long delay. Federal law calls for the EPA to conduct a study on the Renewable Fuel Standard every three years, but the government was four years late this go-around. The agency's previous ethanol study was published in 2011.

488	theguardian	left_center_bias	2018-07-06	Andrew Wheeler: a better weapon for Trump against the environment Scott Pruitt, who on Thursday resigned as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was a firm favourite of Donald Trump. But Pruitt was plagued by scandal and faltered in carrying out the president's agenda of peeling back clean air and water regulations. His replacement is likely to be far more adept. While Pruitt was a bête noire to environmentalists, for his zeal in targeting Obama-era rules and his dismissal of climate science, his attempts at deregulation were regularly framed as rushed and clumsy as they floundered in the courts. Andrew Wheeler, Pruitt's replacement at least in the interim, could be a more effective weapon for Trump. A consummate Washington insider and a former coal lobbyist, he will likely approach his work with the same ideology as Pruitt but without the flamboyance and ethical scandals – a far more dangerous prospect for those aghast at the Trump administration's attitude to the environment." ruitt's agenda was really Trump's agenda and I think Andrew is as fully committed to advancing it as Pruitt was," Myron Ebell, who led the EPA transition team for Trump and has known Wheeler for two decades, told the Guardian." e knows much more about managing the agency and the technical side of the environmental statutes that EPA is charged with enforcing than Pruitt. Undoing [Barack] Obama's regulatory onslaught at EPA is a key part of the president's economic revival agenda, and therefore Wheeler will be a point man for Trump just as Pruitt was." For opponents of the president, the prospect is a daunting one. "Scott Pruitt was the most scandal-plagued cabinet member in an administration rife with corruption," said Christy Goldfuss, an environment advisor to Obama who is now at the Center for American Progress. "There is no reason to believe that Wheeler will fix the problems left behind and put children's health ahead of his industry friends." Confirmed by the Senate as deputy EPA administrator in April, Wheeler is well versed in the machinations of the federal government. He spent four years at the EPA's office of pollution prevention in the Bush and Clinton administrators before working for Senator James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican whose vocal rejection of climate change science involved theatrics such as bringing a snowball on to the Senate floor. Wheeler then became a lobbyist at Faegre Baker Daniels, where he represented Murray Energy, a major coal company, until August 2017. The firm put to Trump a wish list of environmental rollbacks; Wheeler helped in its attempts to fight limits on toxic emissions such as mercury. While working for Marco Rubio's presidential campaign in February 2016, Wheeler wrote a now-deleted Facebook post in which he called Trump a "PR person" and "a bully", which he said should "alone should disqualify him from the White House". That has not hindered his rise in the Trump administration. Shortly after his nomination in October, Wheeler sent an email to Ryan Jackson, Pruitt's chief of staff, with a link to an article by the satirical website the Onion that was headlined: "EPA Promotes Pulsating Black Sludge to Deputy Director." Welcome, pulsating black sludge," Jackson responded, in emails released under freedom of information laws. "I guess I'm going to have to get the cleaning crews to come in more often." Wheeler insisted he didn't want Pruitt's job. "I could have put my hat in the ring for the administrator," he said in June. "I wasn't interested in that. I am still not interested in that." Now that he is in the role he said he didn't covet, he will be tasked with completing the job of dismantling environmental and climate regulations. Pruitt went about it enthusiastically but ran into legal action launched by states such as New York and California, as well as environmental groups. Pruitt's attempt to halt restrictions on emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, was stymied by the courts, as were proposed delays to stricter limits of lead in paint and hazy ozone in urban areas. Trump's EPA has also had difficulty in coming up with robust reasons why fuel efficiency rules for cars should be watered down, or what will replace the clean power plan, given that the agency is legally obliged to force down greenhouse gas emissions. Wheeler, with his knowledge of the rule-making process, will help manage such reversals while avoiding headlines over $1,500 fountain pens, Trump Hotel mattresses or Chick-fil-A franchises." e is low key and likes to keep a low profile," Ebell said. "He may have to do more public speaking than he wants to."A senior EPA official who did not wish to be named said: "I think it will be night and day with Wheeler, or at least night and late afternoon. He will talk to us. He's a human being, not a politician." Wheeler is likely to maintain Pruitt's close ties to industry, however. Under Trump, the fossil fuel industry has wielded unusual influence over the agency that supposedly regulates it and beleaguered staff fret that its public health mission is at risk of being buried." ruitt's removal is just the first step in restoring a strong EPA that gets back to its mission to protect public health and our environment," said Carol Browner, a long-serving EPA chief in Bill Clinton's administration. "Congress must ensure the next EPA administrator is not another industry insider."	False	False	True	False	False
632	The Daily Caller	right_bias	2017-04-05	White House Shoots Down Carbon Tax Rumors In The Press, Again The White House shot down rumors Tuesday that administration officials were considering a tax on carbon dioxide emissions. The Washington Post published a story on Tuesday citing two Trump administration officials who said a carbon tax and value added tax, or VAT, were under consideration as part of a broader tax reform plan. But the White House quickly disavowed the statements allegedly made by the two officials, marking the second time in three weeks the Trump administration has had to shoot down carbon tax rumors." s we have said many times, the President's team is hearing input from experts on all sides of the tax reform debate as we formulate what will ultimately be the President's plan to enact the first significant tax reform since 1986," deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement responding to WaPo's story." s of now, neither a carbon tax nor a VAT are under consideration," Walters said. Walters told reporters in March the Trump administration "is not considering a carbon tax" after press secretary Sean Spicer waffled on the question. White House officials met with a group of Republicans who back a carbon tax in early February. Spicer did not respond to a request for comment.A small group of Republicans have been pushing a carbon tax for years, arguing it's more efficient than federal regulations and could be used to offset revenue losses from reductions in tax rates. Most recently, old guard Republicans on the Climate Leadership Council (CLC) met with White House officials to pitch a carbon tax that would start at $40 per ton and rise over the years. CLC says the tax could replace federal regulations and the revenues could be given back to Americans in the form of "dividends." Many carbon tax proposals are revenue-neutral," reads the Council's plan. "This proposal goes one step further by shrinking the overall size of government and streamlining the regulatory state." The meeting sparked speculation that the White House was considering a carbon tax as part of a broader tax reform plan. Many carbon tax plans claim to raise $1 trillion over ten years. The White House has shot down such speculation, but some administration officials seem intent on telling media outlets a carbon tax is still being considered. Most Republicans don't buy into a carbon tax. They argue it's not very conservative to back what would essentially amount to a tax on energy, which would effectively raise the price of all goods and services. President Donald Trump told the American Energy Alliance in a survey taken during the campaign that he opposed a carbon tax and the Obama administration's "social cost of carbon" estimate. Trump signed an executive order in late March rescinding the Obama administration's "social cost of carbon" estimate. Trump also ordered the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to review and possibly rescind the Clean Power Plan — the cornerstone of the former administration's global warming agenda. Conservative activists point out there's no deal to be made on trading federal environmental regulations for a carbon tax since Trump's already promised to roll back 75 percent of federal rules." f the Trump Administration were to endorse this idea, they would not only be breaking a campaign commitment, but would essentially be negotiating against themselves on regulations," said Tom Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance and former member of Trump's transition team.

50	drudgereport	right_bias	2019-10-31	Explosion in Antarctic sea ice levels may cause another ice age? Upside-down "rivers" of warm ocean water may be one of the causes of Antarctica's ice shelves breaking up, leading to a rise in sea levels. A new study suggests that, in the past, increases in Antarctic sea ice in colder climates may have contributed to ice ages. Using computer simulations, the research looked at past changes during the glacial periods and noted that previous increases in sea ice levels may have significantly altered the circulation of the ocean, which led to a reverse greenhouse effect as carbon dioxide levels in the ocean increased and levels in the air decreased." ne key question in the field is still what caused the Earth to periodically cycle in and out of ice ages," University of Chicago professor and the study's co-author, Malte Jansen, said in a statement. "We are pretty confident that the carbon balance between the atmosphere and ocean must have changed, but we don't quite know how or why." ANTARCTICA'S ICE SHEETS CONTAIN RADIOACTIVE CHLORINE GAS 60 YEARS AFTER NUCLEAR TESTS, STUDY SAYSThe last major ice age ended at the end of the Pleistocene epoch, about 11,700 years ago, as glaciers have periodically grown and then gotten smaller. Researchers believe that changes to the Earth's orbit may be partly responsible for some of the Earth's cooling, but additional factors have likely played a part, Jensen added." he most plausible explanation is that there was some change in how carbon was divided between the atmosphere and the ocean," Jansen continued. "There's no shortage of ideas about how this happens, but it's not quite clear how they all fit together." Researchers also believe a mini-ice age may have occurred roughly 12,800 years ago. It likely stems from an asteroid impact that "rocked the Northern Hemisphere" and led to the Younger Dryas climate event. Jansen pointed out that the Southern Ocean around Antarctica "plays a key role in ocean circulation" due to the deep waters in the region, leading it to have "outsize[d] consequences." AIR POLLUTION MORE DEADLY THAN SMOKING, NEW STUDY FINDS"What this suggests is that it's a feedback loop," said the study's lead author, Alice Marzocchi. "As the temperature drops, less carbon is released into the atmosphere, which triggers more cooling." What surprised me is how much of this increased storage can be attributed to physical changes alone, with Antarctic sea-ice cover being the key player," Marzocchi added, noting that future study of the ocean and the role it plays in the carbon cycle can help simulate "future environmental change."

184	cbsnews	left_center_bias	2019-09-06	Trump administration challenges California on fuel economy standards The Trump administration is challenging California over the state's new automotive emissions and fuel economy "framework" agreement with automakers, insisting setting such standards is the federal government's role. Lawyers at the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Transportation on Friday sent a letter to the chairman of the California Air Resources Board, following California's July "framework" agreement with Ford, Volkswagen, Honda and BMW to abide by certain new greenhouse gas emissions standards." The purpose of this letter is to put California on notice that this framework agreement appears to be inconsistent with federal law," the letter said. "Congress has squarely vested the authority to set fuel economy standards for new motor vehicles, and nationwide standards for GHG vehicle emissions, with the federal government, not with California or any other state." Given the importance Congress placed on the authority of DOT and EPA for motor vehicle fuel economy and nationwide vehicle emissions standards under federal law, we urge you to act immediately to disassociate CARB from the commitments made by the four automakers," the letter added. California had imposed stricter fuel economy and emissions standards long before July, and some of the state's laws were enacted before the Clean Air Act. Congress granted a waiver to allow California to enact its own standards, and a dozen other states also adopted California's standards. The varied standards mean automakers have had to make extra effort in either making two types of cars or manufacturing them all in accordance with the higher California standards. President Trump has pushed for months to weaken Obama-era mileage standards nationwide. Those standards were designed to make cars more fuel efficient and reduce pollution. The administration moves to rescind California's authority are likely to prompt legal battles. When President George W. Bush challenged California's greenhouse gas emissions and mileage-setting ability, California fought it in the courts. The Obama administration subsequently dropped the Bush effort. The Trump administration has argued that the extra expense to comply with the emissions requirements will raise the price of new cars, making them unaffordable and depriving buyers of new safety technology. Many experts, including former EPA engineers, have challenged the administration's safety assertion. Mr. Trump has long advocated for the auto industry, and his administration has emphasized that environmental concerns cannot trump economic considerations." You know, for too long, there's been this conventional wisdom that you've got to choose between economic growth and environmental protection," Energy Secretary Rick Perry said during a July speech on the environment that avoided any mention of climate change. "That's a false choice, and it's one that you've talked about, Mr. President.  It's always been this country, and this country that leads — just like you reminded people last Thursday — the greatness of America, the innovation of America.  And the future of this world will rely greatly upon America and this administration."	False	False	True	False	True
706	CNN	left_bias	2017-06-02	Trump doesn't want to talk about climate change Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump spent an hour Thursday talking about his commitment to economic growth and national stability as he announced the decision to back out of the Paris Climate Accord. After famously calling climate change a "hoax" during the campaign, Trump has avoided the issue of increased man-made greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on global temperatures. Asked Wednesday if Trump thinks human activity is contributing to climate change, White House press secretary Sean Spicer responded , "Honestly, I haven't asked him that. I can get back to you." Two White House officials avoided similar questions at a background briefing with reporters after Trump's speech Thursday. And EPA chief Scott Pruitt dodged the question in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper." This is not about whether climate change is occurring or not," Pruitt said on "The Lead." The pattern of the White House has been to turn away from the discussion of climate change without taking the step to argue directly that global warming isn't real. Instead, there is an administration-wide reluctance to avoid the topic altogether. In recent months, Trump proposed cutting the Environmental Protection Agency budget by more than 30%. EPA has challenged scientific findings on climate change -- including by its own in-house scientists. And EPA cut climate information from its website. Former deputy EPA administrator under President Barack Obama, Bob Perciasepe, said the Trump administration's avoidance of the term "just makes them seem out of touch with reality." Climate change is happening, whether they speak about it or not," said Perciasepe, who currently serves as president of the nonprofit Center for Climate and Energy Solutions. "You can't make something not real if you just don't talk about it. It doesn't change reality -- it's just a way for them to de-emphasize something the rest of the world knows is going on." On Wednesday, the White House declared June National Oceans Month and Great Outdoors Month. While the proclamations -- a relatively standard annual designation -- praised the US's oceans and natural landscapes, the language clearly differed from Obama's. Where Obama's 2016 proclamations discussed the impacts of global warming, including drought and rising sea levels, Trump's focused on energy production, fisheries management and tourism with no mention of climate change. And the administration is adopting the same reasoning in press releases. Last month, the Interior Department released a study by the U.S. Geological Survey that highlighted the link between sea-level rise and global climate change. Except the release had one thing missing -- any mention of climate change. Three of the study's scientist authors told The Washington Post that they had to ultimately delete a line from the report that read "Global climate change drives sea-level rise, increasing the frequency of coastal flooding." Instead, the USGS release leaves the cause unmentioned . It begins: "The frequency and severity of coastal flooding throughout the world will increase rapidly and eventually double in frequency over the coming decades even with only moderate amounts of sea level rise."A defense against believing humans are responsible for climate change is that scientific studies are not 100% certain -- a stance frequently used by members of the Trump administration that muddles the scientific consensus that man-made emissions are driving global warming."I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do, and there's tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact," Pruitt said in a CNBC interview in March . "So, no, I would not agree that it's a primary contributor to the global warming that we see." While the White House may be against jumping to conclusions on the available scientific studies -- with Pruitt even calling for more data from industry scientists -- the administration has done little to back up those calls monetarily. In fact, instead of spending money to further study the effects and reality, or unreality of global warming -- the administration has opted instead to cut much of the major funding that would go towards the studies." It is hypocritical," said Andrew Rosenberg, director for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. "They are complaining about uncertainty but at the same time increasing uncertainty by cutting back on ways to measure [climate change.]"For many, the administration's reluctance to deal with the idea of climate change comes down to one thought -- that economic growth and climate awareness cannot go hand in hand." The idea that they are operating on is that the US will be at a disadvantage if it deals with climate change. Most businesses would think that working on the climate issues can and has been creating jobs," said Perciasepe. "It can strengthen United States company's competitiveness in the global markets."

570	rt	questionable_source	2018-10-24	Trump threatens to cut federal aid to California over 'lousy management' of water & wildfires US President Donald Trump is taking California to task for the management of its forests and dams, blaming red tape for the devastating forest fires and drought plaguing the bluest of blue states, and threatening to withhold aid. Speaking at a White House address on Tuesday, Trump was shocked that Californians weren't using the water contained by their dams to put out the fires and irrigate their fields. "We have so much water they could actually water some of it," he said in disbelief. About half (48 percent) of California's land is currently experiencing drought conditions, which – combined with high temperatures and strong winds – are largely to blame for the record-setting rash of fires in the state, according to state fire chiefs. Trump, a proud climate change skeptic, attributes the fires to "lousy management." He has repeatedly said the forests are too dense and need to be thinned – a problem the logging industry would be happy to help with. As for the water, it's Trump vs. the Delta smelt, an endangered fish scientists argue can only be saved if the dammed waters are allowed to flow into the ocean instead of being used to irrigate the farms and homes of California residents. Trump wants to redistribute that water to Californians, he says. Trump threatened to withhold future federal aid if California does not "get on the ball," implying that the state's environmental woes were its own fault. It's hard not to think there's an element of spite in this rhetoric, as wealthy and influential Californians led talk of secession following Trump's 2016 election victory. Last week, Trump signed a memo geared toward improving "the reliable supply and delivery of water in California, Oregon, and Washington" by streamlining environmental review and approval for water infrastructure projects. It's not a good week for the Delta smelt. Trump announced yesterday he will nominate Aurelia Skipwith, a former Monsanto lawyer, as director of the Fish and Wildlife Service. While she has worked for the department since 2013, environmentalists accuse her of gutting protections for migratory birds and endangered species.	False	False	True	False	False

The rainforest lost 9,762 sq km (3,769 sq miles) of its vegetation between August 2018 and July 2019, Inpe says. Far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has in the past questioned the accuracy of data provided by Inpe. Scientists say the Amazon has suffered losses at an accelerated rate since Mr Bolsonaro took office in January. They say the president favours development over conservation.• Who is Brazil's new leader Jair Bolsonaro?Mr Bolsonaro - who in July dismissed a similar Inpe report as flawed - has not commented on the latest data. As the largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. Over the past decade, previous governments in Brazil had managed to reduce deforestation with concerted action by federal agencies and a system of fines. But Mr Bolsonaro and his ministers have criticised the penalties and overseen a dramatic fall in confiscations of timber and convictions for environmental crimes.	False	False	False	False	False

A coalition of local environmental groups organized the march to the Arsht Center in Miami, where this round of debates is being held, with marchers sporting signs calling for a specific climate change debate and pushing for the Green New Deal. Melissa Baldwin, co-organizer of Miami Climate Month, which organized the rally, says from the moment she and her fellow organizers found out the first debate would be in Miami, they wanted to "put a spotlight on climate change, because you can't come to Miami without talking about climate change." Climate change and fossil fuels have already disturbed the daily lives of Floridians. Sea level rise and warming temperatures threaten cities like Miami. Kim Ross, ReThink Energy Florida leader, resident witnessed people in her community in Tallahassee feeling helpless after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill disaster, which damaged Gulf Coast ecosystems." his isn't something in the future," Ross says. "This is something that's happening now and needs to be addressed now." At the first 2020 Democratic debate on Wednesday night, Democrats spent less than 10 minutes talking about climate change. Though not an extensive conversation, that was still more time spent talking about climate change than in all of three debates combined between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in 2016. Baldwin tells Mother Jones that climate and energy policy needs a prolonged conversation at every debate because "climate change is an issue that affects every other issue: agriculture, the economy, including tourism." She recalls a friend saying, "Who wants to go to Disney when it's 105 degrees outside?"	False	False	False	False	False
95	talkingpointsmemo	left_bias	2019-02-07	Democrats Mobilize On Green New Deal WASHINGTON (AP) — Democrats including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York are calling for a Green New Deal intended to transform the U.S. economy to combat climate change and create thousands of jobs in renewable energy. The freshman lawmaker and veteran Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts are teaming up on the plan, which aims to eliminate the U.S. carbon footprint by 2030.A joint resolution drafted by Ocasio-Cortez and Markey sets a goal to meet "100 percent of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable and zero-emission energy sources," including dramatic increases in wind and solar power.A news conference at the Capitol is set for Thursday, the day they introduce the resolution. While setting lofty goals, the plan does not explicitly call for eliminating the use of fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, a nod to pragmatism that may disappoint some of Ocasio-Cortez's strongest supporters. Even so, their Green New Deal goes far beyond the Clean Power Plan proposed by President Barack Obama. President Donald Trump has scrapped Obama's plan, which imposed emissions limits on coal-fired power plants, as a job-killer. The Democrats are likely to meet resistance to their proposal in Congress, especially in the Republican-controlled Senate. Trump, who has expressed doubts about climate change, also is likely to oppose it. The resolution marks the first time Ocasio-Cortez and other lawmakers have attached legislative language onto the Green New Deal, a concept that until now has been largely undefined other than as a call for urgent action to head off catastrophic climate change and create jobs. Several Democratic presidential hopefuls have embraced the idea of a Green New Deal without saying exactly what it means. Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement that the plan will create "unprecedented levels of prosperity and wealth for all while ensuring economic and environmental justice and security." She calls for a "World War II-scale mobilization" that includes high-quality education and health care, clean air and water and safe, affordable housing. Answering critics who call the plan unrealistic, Ocasio-Cortez says that when President John F. Kennedy wanted to go to the moon by the end of the 1960s, "people said it was impossible." She also cites Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society and the interstate highway system begun under Dwight D. Eisenhower as examples of American know-how and capability. While focusing on renewable energy, Ocasio-Cortez said the plan would include existing nuclear power plants but block new nuclear plants. Nuclear power does not emit greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming. The resolution does not include a price tag, but some Republicans predict it would cost in the trillions of dollars. They denounced the plan at House hearings on climate change on Wednesday. The Green New Deal would be paid for "the same way we paid for the original New Deal, World War II, the bank bailouts, tax cuts for the rich and decades of war — with public money appropriated by Congress," Ocasio-Cortez said. Government can take an equity stake in Green New Deal projects "so the public gets a return on its investment," she said.	True	False	False	False	True
72	thedailycaller	right_bias	2019-02-07	'Green New Deal' Looks To Tackle The Scourge Of Cow Flatulence Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's newly-released "Green New Deal" resolution has gotten a lot of attention for its 100 percent renewable energy goal, but the bill also vaguely references another source of emissions. The resolution calls for a World War II-style mobilization effort to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural operations. If that's the case, that means any subsequent "Green New Deal" legislation would have to deal with a major source of methane emissions — cow flatulence. Methane makes up 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions that scientists blame for global warming. Enteric fermentation, the digestive process in cows and other ruminant animals, is the largest source of U.S. methane emissions, according to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data. EPA says "cattle account for the majority of [methane] emissions in the United States for this source category," referring to emissions from enteric fermentation. (RELATED: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: 'Green New Deal Is About Social Justice')Being a non-binding resolution, the "Green New Deal" doesn't offer any specifics on how livestock emissions would be phased down or eliminated. The question then becomes: How do you eliminate emissions from cows, sheep and other animals?Certainly, environmental groups have increasingly called for getting beef out of people's diets in the name of the climate, but there are legitimate worries doing so would be a net negative on overall public health. Some scientists have looked into reducing flatulence from ruminant animals. The U.S. government funded a 2014 study to find out why some types of sheep burped and farted more than others. The Obama administration released a plan to clamp down on methane emissions in 2014, which included programs to cut emissions from dairy operations. Republican lawmakers worried the Obama-era effort could have resulted in new regulations or taxes on farmers. Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but makes up a much smaller slice of America's emissions profile. Natural gas systems and landfills also emit methane, which Democrats and environmentalists want to regulate more.

875	Breitbart	questionable_source	2017-04-26	Al Gore-Backed Group Demands Countries Kick In $15 Trillion to Fight Global Warming In its report, ETC insists that "investments" of up to $500 billion per annum would not "pose a major macroeconomic challenge" to nations accepting the call to fund the project. The group is made up of energy company executives, activists, investment bankers, Al Gore, and others who would financially benefit from the immense influx of  funds, the Daily Caller reports. According to the ETC website, the group's goal is to "accelerate change towards low-carbon energy systems that enable robust economic development and limit the rise in global temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius." The chief avenue the group advocates to cut global warming is to force governments around the world to place an ever growing tax on carbon emissions as a means to force change in energy policy. The punishing taxes, they say, would cause the energy industry to seriously explore alternate energy sources and cut back use of fossil fuels. It recommends that the world cut emissions to a "net zero" by the year 2050 to hold back global heating. The group also calls for direct investment in green energy. ETC claims that the world must fund "investment in renewables and other low-carbon technologies some $6 trillion higher ($300 billion per year); while the largest required increases – of almost $9 trillion ($450 billion per year) – will be in more efficient energy saving equipment and buildings." ETC has focused its activism on the Paris climate agreement, which President Obama signed onto without Senate approval. The plan was to take effect in 2016, but since coming to office President Trump has put a hold on much of the country's compliance with the agreement. Trump has also begun considering whether or not to completely pull out of the agreement. Trump's Environmental Protection Agency chief, Scott Pruitt, has urged the president to exit the agreement and at least one climate scientist, Dr. Duane Thresher, has warned Trump not to cave in to his daughter's "climate change madness."

726	The Huffington Post	left_bias	2017-10-11	France's Biggest Bank Becomes The First To Cut Off Funding For Natural Gas Fracking BNP Paribas on Wednesday became the first big bank to pledge to stop financing natural gas fracking projects as part of a new policy cheered by environmentalists as having the greatest impact of any financial giant yet. Under the new policy, France's largest bank will refuse to lend to companies who generate more than half their revenue from fracked oil, gas or liquefied natural gas export terminals. The rules also apply to tar sands, considered one of the dirtiest sources of oil. Multinational banks, including BNP Paribas, began putting strict limits on funding for coal projects in 2015. At that point, coal was becoming an unprofitable investment, and banks faced mounting pressure from environmentalists to stop supporting the dirtiest fuels in the lead up the Paris climate agreement. Last month, JPMorgan Chase became the target of a new campaign urging it to end financing for companies that drill tar sands, a particularly dirty source of oil that forms the backbone of Canada's industry. Until now, no financial giant has clamped down on natural gas, which produces far less carbon dioxide than oil or coal. The fuel now provides most of the United States' electricity and is credited with reducing emissions by weaning the country off coal. That has allowed advocates to tout the gas as a critical tool in the transition from heavily-polluting fuels to renewable energy. But fracking ― an extraction technique that involves shooting a highly-pressurized chemical and sand-laced water into shale rock to extract oil and gas ― has become a lightning rod for environmentalists. It produces toxic wastewater and leaks emissions of methane, a far more most potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. And the process of liquefying natural gas from vapor requires so much energy it ends up being as dirty as coal." he scientific literature on the climate impact of gas, especially fracked gas, is emerging," Jason Disterhoft, a senior campaigner at Rainforest Action Network, told HuffPost by phone. Now that the prices of solar and wind energy were plummeting, there's less need to use natural gas as a stepping stone between dirtier fossil fuels and renewables, he added. BNP Paribas offered few details on its new policy, including when it would go into effect, though it said it should have an update by the end of the year. Europe's second largest bank also said that companies could continue to receive backing if they lower the amount of revenue earned from fracking or tar sands to less than half their business. The exact ratio has not yet been decided, a spokeswoman said." ven though we're going to have this policy in place doesn't mean at the same time we'll right away cut all the clients that don't fall under it," Mylene Benmoussa, a BNP Paribas spokeswoman, told HuffPost by phone on Wednesday. "It's going to be a gradual and shared transition." The bank had not not yet calculated how many clients would be affected by the new policy, and could not immediately respond to questions about how much money is invested in the targeted sectors. France banned fracking in 2011. The country generates 11 percent of its electricity from gas, according to data from RTE, the French transmission operator. And the government in Paris announced plans last month to prohibit oil and gas production by 2040. For a bank in the regulatory environment BNP Paribas is facing, an aggressive climate policy makes business sense. Yet the announcement garnered praise from three environmental groups that teamed up to pressure BNP Paribas to curtail support for fossil fuels that pose a particular threat of exacerbating climate change. The trio includes the San Francisco-based Rainforest Action Network, the French chapter of Friends of Earth, and Save the Rio Grande Valley from Liquefied Natural Gas, a local Texas group protesting the construction of a liquefied natural gas terminal in the state's southern region. Still, the move represents a public relations victory for a bank plagued by scandals in recent years. In 2015, the company was ordered to pay $8.9 billion to the U.S. for violating sanctions against Sudan, Cuba and Iran. In June, three human rights groups accused BNP Paribas of complicity in the 1994 Rwandan genocide that killed more than 800,000 people. In July, the Federal Reserve fined the firm $246 million for its "unsafe and unsound practices" in foreign currency trading division, failing to crack down on employees who violated rules on sharing information with competitors." e're a long-standing partner to the energy sector and we're determined to support the transition to a more sustainable world," BNP Paribas CEO Jean-Laurent Bonnafé said in a statement. "As an international bank, our role is to help drive the energy transition and contribute to the decarbonization of the economy."	True	False	False	False	True
52	nationalreview	right_bias	2019-04-24	Environmental Hypocrites of the Left Why progressives refuse to live by their own Earth Day blusterGeorge Monbiot recently expressed a carefully calibrated environmental message that allows people on the environmental left to feel self-righteous without making any real sacrifice. In a video that was shared widely, including by celebrities such as James Corden, the British writer argues that the only way to help the environment is to change the "big, structural, political economic stuff." Monbiot concludes that we need to "go straight to the heart of capitalism and overthrow it." At the same time, he dismisses "pathetic, micro-consumerist bollocks which just isn't going to get us anywhere." This is absolution for those who want to feel green but can't be bothered with going to the effort and expense of actually living their own values. Publicly advocating the "do as I say, not as I do" approach reinforces the reality that conservatives tend to live out the environmental ethic that the Left only preaches. As a conservative who has worked in environmental policy for two decades, I have been frustrated watching as ideological fellow travelers avoid environmental topics, even as they privately express their commitment to environmental stewardship. As the Left becomes more detached from responsible and effective environmental solutions, conservatives should confidently fill the void. One reason conservatives do not engage is that environmentalism has become synonymous with horrible government policy. Every Earth Day, we are treated to theatrical images of marches featuring unhinged activists demanding action on a range of environmental issues. Clever hashtags are generated. Alarmist slogans are flaunted. Naked people glue themselves to park benches. And all who disagree with the demands for more government power are denigrated as "deniers." The other 364 days of the year, however, people on the left do little in their daily lives to justify all that environmental browbeating. A study by researchers at the University of Michigan and Cornell University found that those who are "highly concerned" about climate change are "least likely to report individual-level actions" to reduce their environmental impact. Those who considered themselves "skeptical" of climate change "were most likely to report engaging in individual-level pro-environmental behaviors." To be sure, not all conservatives are skeptical of climate change, but generally, we aren't nearly as alarmist about climate change or other environmental issues, even when we recognize the risk. That gap between the Left's loud talk and their unwillingness to make personal sacrifices is not an accident. It is now part of their dogma. Individual actions are mere "bollocks," useless gestures. Only the sacrifices made by others will make a difference. This dichotomy is evident in my home state of Washington, where politicians pride themselves on showing "leadership" in the effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This year, our legislature enacted a law requiring the state to meet a 100 percent renewable-energy target by 2045. Environmental activists tweeted their support, saying they "demand action now" and worrying about the climate crisis. Ironically, though, many who demand action do little of it themselves. For only a few dollars a month, anyone who supports renewable energy can already buy renewable-energy credits (RECs), ensuring that there is enough renewable energy on the grid to cover their personal use. I asked one politician pushing for the 100 percent–renewable requirement if she buys RECs to cover her environmental impact. She admitted that she does not and has no plans to do so. This is consistent with the message of Monbiot and political leaders pushing the Green New Deal. Personal sacrifice is of little consequence, so why even try? Even as they call for an end to air travel, politicians who demand we impose lifestyle change have not curtailed their own carbon-producing travel, despite living in the era of HD video conferencing. The most effective environmental efforts are often small, personal actions in which people have skin in the game. Farmers find ways to conserve water because waste costs money. Aluminum cans are lighter today because it saves resources and they cost less to ship. Homeowners and businesses conserve energy because they pay the price for every kilowatt-hour. When they don't save, they change course, unlike politicians who fear public embarrassment and throw good money after bad. This isn't just a theory. The amount of energy per unit of GDP in the United States has fallen steadily for several decades. There are no sharp drops. Instead, the improvement is gradual and constant, as individuals and businesses find ways to squeeze a bit more out of their energy use. Politicians can lecture all they want, but these are truly the front lines of environmental stewardship. As Earth Day 2019 came and went, the pattern of environmentalists demanding action that they themselves won't take predictably repeated itself. The pattern of conservatives' avoiding talk of environmental stewardship even as they live it every day, however, is a pattern we should break. Effective environmental policy doesn't start with politicians and publicity stunts. Conservatives understand this. We should make it clear that personal environmental stewardship is not only more effective, it is a more moral way to live.	True	True	True	True	False
112	thehuffingtonpost	left_bias	2019-09-05	Public Land Gets Its Moment At The Climate Town Hall A federal report last year found that about a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions in the United States come from fossil fuel extraction on federal land. As the Trump administration continues its push to expand such development, top candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination agree that America's public land must be a tool in the fight against climate change, not a contributor to the problem. During CNN's marathon town hall on climate change Wednesday, candidates vowed to end oil, gas and coal leasing on federal land as part of a shared goal to decarbonizing the economy and prevent catastrophic warming. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro said they would also work to expand federally protected acreage." e actually need to undo the damage that this administration has done and then expand the lands that we're protecting in our country," Castro said. "We can do that." Most of the 10 Democratic candidates who appeared on stage Wednesday have released climate plans that call for reversing Trump's sweeping land rollbacks, safeguarding new sites or fully funding the popular Land and Water Conservation Fund, which uses offshore fossil-fuel revenue to protect natural areas and water resources. Castro, Harris, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and former Vice President Joe Biden have all committed to working toward protecting 30% of America's land and water by 2030." he next president must be ready to lead the climate response we need to see on our shared lands and waters," Huntley said. "If we are going to keep pace with what science demands, we must reduce greenhouse gas emissions on our public lands while also restoring protections for threatened forests, from the Southern Appalachians to Alaska's Tongass" National Forest. Ahead of Wednesday's forum, Harris released a $10 trillion climate plan that calls for "diversifying the marine and land ecosystems that we protect and targeting biodiversity hotspots and critical wildlife corridors," as well as using existing presidential authorities to set aside critical landscapes. Biden's plan promises to permanently protect areas like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ― a pristine Alaska wilderness that the Trump administration is working to open to oil drilling ― and to set up programs to reforest and expand renewable energy on federal lands. Castro's $10 trillion climate plan, also released this week, calls for designating new national monuments, parks and wildlife refuge and outlines a so-called "Green Opportunity Corps" that would put 15,000 young adults to work in areas like public land conservation. He is the only candidate to put out an animal and wildlife welfare policy, which seeks to end euthanasia for household dogs and cats and strengthen protections for endangered species." e need to connect the dots," Castro said Wednesday. "I've connected the dots of actually preserving more of our lands both for the benefit of wildlife and for our benefit to combat climate change." Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was not asked Wednesday about how she would approach America's public lands and waters, despite being the only candidate to release a comprehensive plan specific to protecting them. Her policy vision, unveiled in April, includes overturning Trump's land rollbacks, a moratorium on oil and gas leases on federal land, and recruiting 10,000 youth and veterans for a "21st Century Civilian Conservation Corps." It's not enough to end our public lands' contribution to climate change," Warren wrote in an announcement at the time. "We have an enormous opportunity to make them a part of the climate solution, and for both economic and environmental reasons, we should take it." All 10 candidates that participated in the CNN climate forum have voiced support for the Green New Deal, the landmark resolution unveiled in February by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and that outlined lofty goals of reaching net-zero emissions by midcentury. Supporters of the Green New Deal have said public land is key to its success. The plan calls for "ensuring that public lands, waters, and oceans are protected" and "restoring and protecting threatened, endangered, and fragile ecosystems." Questions posed to candidates on Wednesday varied, and not all were asked about public land and conservation. But nearly all have policy proposals that drive home the need for the nation to be a better environmental steward. Former Rep. Beto O'Rourke (Texas) says he would go beyond previous presidents to "protect our most wild, beautiful, and biodiverse places for generations to come — including more of the Arctic and of our sensitive landscapes and seascapes than ever before."

824	Daily Mail	questionable_source	2017-06-01	Ross v. Tillerson: Paris climate split in Trump's cabinet U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Thursday openly dismissed concerns raised by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson about President Donald Trump's decision to exit the Paris Climate Treaty. Tillerson, a former ExxonMobil CEO, told senators during his January confirmation hearing that the U.S. should stay engaged in global warming mitigation instead of walking away.'It's important that the U.S. maintains its seat at the table about how to address the threat of climate change, which does require a global response,' Tillerson said then. And he has fretted privately to confidants that withdrawing from the Paris deal could both undercut America's credibility on other multilateral agreements and impair relationships with foreign allies. The U.S. commerce chief told Fox News, just minutes after Trump blasted the climate agreement as a wealth-transfer gimmick, that Tillerson is wrong.'I have a great deal of respect for Secretary Tillerson. I happen to disagree strongly with him on this particular issue.'He added that 'I just don't see the connection, frankly,' between the Paris pullout and America's trustworthiness in future negotiations.'I don't agree with that at all. There's no reason to make one agreement [connect] with another,' Ross said, using the Trans-Pacific Partnership as Exhibit A.'The sky didn't fall when we pulled out of TPP and the sky certainly won't fall now that we've pulled out of the Paris Accord,' he said. 'I think the president is right.'Ross said much of the predicted backlash from other countries that drive global warming concerns would be rooted in economics, not science.'Any time that people were taking money out of your pocket, and you make them put it back in, they're not going to be happy. And that's what's happening here,' he said.'This wasn't about climate. It was about U.S. money going to other countries.'Ross has firmly rooted himself in the train of thought that sees climate change agreements as thinly veiled pretexts for demanding global payouts from Washington and a free ride for its trade adversaries.'The president made clear we already are far ahead of other countries in terms of CO2 reduction,' Ross said, describing U.S. efforts to reduce carbon outputs.'And how can it be an effective deal when it allows China and India, two of the major polluters, to keep increasing their pollution for another decade or two?''That doesn't sound to me like a climate accord,' he said. 'It simply sounds like a transfer of wealth from the United States to other countries.'Tillerson, on the other hand, has aggressively pushed for greater recognition of America's obligation to lead the charge. Three weeks ago he signed an international document establishing the importance of the Paris Treaty in tackling climate change. The Fairbanks Declaration was adopted at the meeting by the members of the Arctic Council, whose members – like the U.S. – have territory above the Arctic Circle. The declaration says that the Arctic 'is warming at more than twice the rate of the global average, resulting in widespread social, environmental, and economic impacts in the Arctic and worldwide.'Last year, just one day before Trump was elected, Tillerson told a conference in Abu Dhabi that 'at ExxonMobil, we share the view that the risks of climate change are serious and warrant thoughtful action. Addressing these risks requires broad-based, practical solutions around the world.''Importantly, as a result of the Paris agreement, both developed and developing countries are now working together to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions,' he said then, 'while recognizing differing national responsibilities, capacities and circumstances.'Tillerson, who met with the president on Wednesday in a last-ditch effort to change his mind about pulling out of the Paris Accord, did not attend Thursday's Rose Garden announcement that America's participation was at an end.

While September is the most active month for hurricanes worldwide, the North Atlantic hurricane season is set to continue until November 30, raising the question – where are these monster storms originating?READ MORE: 4 dead as Hurricane Irma rocks Florida, leaving 3.5mn without power (PHOTOS, VIDEOS)Most of the major hurricanes that have impacted the US originated in Cape Verde – a nation on a volcanic archipelago off the northwest coast of Africa – according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The interaction between the hot dry air of the Sahara Desert and the cooler, more humid air from the Gulf of Guinea below creates high-altitude winds known as the African Easterly Jet. Blowing from east to west across Africa, the winds form clusters of thunderstorms once the waves of air have enough moisture, lift, and instability. The storms typically form every two to three days in a region near Cape Verde, but it is not until the period between summer and autumn that conditions become favorable for the development of tropical cyclones.'Tropical waves' of air interact with the warm equatorial water of the Atlantic as they head west, prompting columns of warm moist air to rise from the ocean and create an ideal environment to develop into a full-blown hurricane. However, if the Saharan Air Layer, commonly known as Saharan dust, is in the vicinity at the time it can weaken tropical cyclones over the Atlantic. This very dry air is most likely to have an impact in July and early August, Dr Gerry Bell, a hurricane climate specialist with NOAA told RT. com. This is when atmospheric conditions are only marginally conducive, if at all, for tropical storm formation. Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Andrew began life as tropical waves off the coast of west Africa. Irma was first spotted as a tropical disturbance off the Cape Verde Islands in late August, before becoming a hurricane over the Atlantic as it moved west. Cape Verde hurricanes are known for being particularly large and intense, however not all hurricanes hitting the US originate here: Harvey evolved from a tropical wave to the east of the Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean Sea.A 2015 study examining the relationship between West African tropical disturbances and Atlantic hurricanes found that the larger an area covered by the disturbances was, the more likely it would develop into a hurricane only one to two weeks later. Is the US getting hit more frequently by hurricanes?Hurricane seasons have generally been longer since 1995, according to Bell, which he says is consistent with a high activity era. The season lengths since 1995 are comparable to those during the last active era of the 1950s-1960s.A study published in Nature last year, led by James Elsner, a climate scientist and geographer at Florida State University, found that, while hurricanes were becoming more powerful, they were also becoming less frequent. However, there appears to be little consensus among scientific researchers. An early draft of the government publication, the US Climate Science Special Report, published by the New York Times notes an "observed upward trend in North Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s." The NOAA Geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory, meanwhile, says it is too early to conclude that global warming has already had a "detectable impact on Atlantic hurricane or global tropical cyclone activity." However, expects it to result in more intense tropical cyclones globally with substantially higher rainfall rates by the end of the 21st century. It notes, however, that there is little evidence to suggest that climate change will lead to a large increase in numbers of tropical storms or overall hurricanes in the Atlantic.

166	theguardian	left_center_bias	2019-09-05	Democratic 2020 hopefuls split over tackling climate crisis Democrats vying for president revealed a fundamental split over how aggressively the US should tackle climate change in a seven-hour town hall meeting on Wednesday. Bernie Sanders painted an apocalyptic future wreaked by the climate crisis and pledged to wage war on the fossil fuel industry. A high-energy Elizabeth Warren urged optimism for building a better America and the former vice-president Joe Biden, who has a pitched a more moderate proposal, said he would push other nations to recommit to stronger action. Sanders said without radical change the world will be uninhabitable. "The damage to the world will be irreparable," the Vermont senator said, adding that he is proposing "the largest, most comprehensive climate plan presented by any presidential candidate in the history of the United States". With many questions focused on what candidates would ask Americans to sacrifice, Elizabeth Warren pushed back on the framing. Asked if the government should tell people what kind of lightbulbs they can have, the Massachusetts senator quipped: "Oh come on, give me a break!""There are a lot of ways that we try to change our energy consumption and our pollution," she said. "Some of it is with lightbulbs, some of it is on straws, some of it – dang – is on cheeseburgers." But most of the responsibility lies with industry, not individuals, she said, adding "this is exactly what the fossil fuel industry wants us to talk about". Biden meanwhile pitched himself as the candidate who could lead negotiations with the diplomatic might of the US. He said his first step as president would be to call an international meeting to strengthen the Paris climate agreement." e should be organizing the world, demanding change, we need a diplomat-in-chief," Biden said. "Look what's happening now in the Amazon, what's going on? Nothing." Biden, who critics say has one of the less progressive climate plans, also got grilled on his plans to attend a fundraiser hosted by the founder of a natural gas company. He claimed the supporter is not a corporate executive. Where Biden would invest $1.7tn to fight climate change, Warren proposed $10tn and Sanders would put forward $16.3tn, setting them widely apart. The Democrats faced questions on whether their proposals would ban fracking for natural gas, prohibit exports of oil, gas and coal, change nutritional guidelines to limit meat consumption and transition to all electric vehicles. Their answers – and reactions to them – foreshadowed the fight ahead with conservatives and industry regardless of who becomes the next president. Donald Trump in a thread on Twitter charged that Democrat plans "will raise your energy bill and prices at the pump". The fossil fuels industry, through the oil trade group the American Petroleum Institute and the American Energy Alliance, said the plans would hurt poor Americans." onight, while American families worry about making ends meet, the Democrats running for president will be working hard to outbid each other on who can raise electricity and gasoline prices the highest, and the fastest," the alliance said in an emailed statement. The event was perhaps the longest stretch of primetime television ever dedicated to climate change, held after the Democratic National Committee refused to sanction an official climate debate between candidates and amid unprecedented pressure from young activists and the Democratic voting base to tackle the climate crisis. On Wednesday, a list of demands was released by a coalition of youth-led groups whose lodestar is Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager and activist who sparked a global wave of walkouts by school students over the climate crisis. Thunberg arrived in New York last week, after crossing the Atlantic in a solar-powered yacht for an upcoming UN climate summit. According to Yale University polling, the climate emergency is now the second most important voting issue for Democrats, behind healthcare. Among all voting Americans, nearly seven in 10 are worried about climate change, the highest ever recorded level of concern. There are strong bipartisan majorities in favour of setting pollution limits on industry, businesses, cars and trucks. Donald Trump, who is dismantling rules aimed at lowering planet-warming gases, attacked the Democratic candidates for proposing unrealistic, costly plans. "The Democrats' destructive "environmental" proposals will raise your energy bill and prices at the pump," the president wrote on Twitter. "Don't the Democrats care about fighting American poverty?"Trump's campaign quickly took the opportunity to post a clip of California senator Kamala Harris saying she would ban plastic straws alongside an ad for Trump-branded straws. But some young conservatives have raised concerns that Republican intransigence over the climate crisis will cost the party a generation of voters. Recent Newsy-Ipsos polling found that 59% of millennial and Generation Z Republicans support the Green New Deal." here are a lot of young people who are conservative and believe in climate change … They will not vote for a Republican if they're voting on this issue," said Benjamin Backer, founder of the American Conservation Coalition, which proposes action on the climate crisis. "And I think that's a problem with the lack of involvement from the Republican Party on this issue for the past 10 years."	False	False	True	False	True
93	shareblue	left_bias	2019-06-24	Trump officials keep getting caught hiding scientific reports they don't like The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is actively trying to muzzle and minimize scientific reports warning about the impacts of climate change, according to a Monday Politico report. The research Trump officials are trying to keep hidden could help farmers deal with the impact of climate change, such as how climate change affects the protein in wheat fed to cattle, or how changes in carbon dioxide levels alters the nutrients in rice. But rather than promote such peer-reviewed research by the USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS), the agency refuses to even issue press releases. In one instance about research on rice, the agency tried to dissuade a research partner, the University of Washington, from publicly discussing research." It was so unusual to have an agency basically say: 'Don't do a press release,'" Jeff Hodson, a communications director at the university, told Politico. "We stand for spreading the word about the science we do, especially when it has a potential impact on millions and millions of people." Research from Politico showed the USDA did not attempt any promotion or press releases for 45 ARS studies that mentioned climate change." The intent is to try to suppress a message — in this case, the increasing danger of human-caused climate change," said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. "Who loses out? The people, who are already suffering the impacts of sea level rise and unprecedented super storms, droughts, wildfires and heat waves." Anti-science censorship has become a hallmark of the Trump administration. In August 2018, a survey of 63,000 government scientists warned that "censorship has been a problem in the Trump administration from the beginning." When a multi-agency report on climate change was released in November 2018, Trump's EPA administrator, Andrew Wheeler, complained that it had too much science in it. As recently as June, the Trump administration prevented a scientist from writing about climate change in testimony before Congress because it didn't "jibe" with the administration's view on the topic. Trump has been clear that he does not believe in the sound science behind climate change, writing it off as a hoax. Trump said he didn't believe the multi-agency scientific report about climate change noted above. Trump has also chosen fellow climate change skeptics for the highest levels of his administration, including Sonny Perdue, who leads the Department of Agriculture. In May, career government economists accused Perdue and his agency of retaliating against them for their reports showing that Trump's tax and farm subsidy policies are hurting the very rural voters he promised to help. Now farmers may also feel the brunt of the pain from not receiving information about how to cope with the changing environment. Perdue refused to comment on this latest report that his agency is suppressing scientific research." If you're taking a certain block of research and not communicating it, it defeats the purpose of why USDA does the research in the first place," Robert Bonnie, who worked at USDA during President Obama's administration, told Politico. Rather than embrace science, the Trump administration is hurting farmers in order to cling to an anti-science political position. Published with permission of The American Independent.

589	The Daily Caller	right_bias	2017-05-04	Environmentalists Flood The Courts With Lawsuits To Stop Trump's Agenda At least eighteen environmental groups filed four lawsuits in one day against the Trump administration, including suits to keep in place Obama-era environmental policies. Environmentalists filed their suit Wednesday. They are living up to threats made after President Donald Trump took office — namely, to use the courts to preserve Obama administration policies. These include orders that stop offshore drilling and force the closure of coal plants. The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) led eight other groups in a legal challenge of Trump's recent executive order to reopen large swaths of Arctic seas to offshore drilling. LCV is one of the many environmental groups that endorsed Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election." ever in LCV's history have we taken this step," Gene Karpinski, LCV's president, said in a statement. "The permanent protections President Obama established for the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans were won with years of research, lobbying and organizing." The suit argues Obama used his authority Section 12(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to put most Arctic waters off-limits to development. The act does not allow future presidents to undo placing waters off-limits, activists argue. The same day, Earthjustice and the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD) filed suits to challenge the administration. Earthjustice sued to stop the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) decision to indefinitely stay the implementation of wastewater discharge rules for coal plants. CBD filed suit against EPA for not finalizing deadlines for the cities of Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia to meet ozone standards. CBD also sued for Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt's emails and schedule. Earthjustice and CBD joined LCV's suit against Trump's EPA. So far, CBD has filed 15 lawsuits against the administration, something which the activist group publicly brags about. CBD famously sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to stop the construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. CBD wants the court to force DHS to conduct a "programmatic environmental impact statement" on border enforcement operations. Trump can expect more lawsuits as he continues to rollback Obama-era policies. Environmentalists spent years lobbying and campaigning to get such policies in place. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), for example, played a pivotal role in crafting the Clean Power Plan, which became Obama's signature global warming policy. But Trump ordered EPA to review the Clean Power Plan, asking the agency to see if it needed to be modified or rescinded. NRDC and other environmental groups were already locked in legal battles to keep the power plant rule from being overturned. NRDC has filed its fair share of lawsuits against Trump as well. They filed two lawsuits against the administration in February to keep the EPA from withdrawing a mercury rule and to oppose an executive order requiring agencies to repeal two regulations for every new one imposed. In March, NRDC and other environmentalists sued to block the Keystone XL oil pipeline from being built. They also tried to intervene in a lawsuit against a national ocean monument Obama created. The group filed at least two lawsuits in April challenging Trump's delaying energy efficiency standards for appliances and the administration's refusal to ban certain pesticides. NRDC attorneys are also representing LCV and others in the suit to keep Arctic waters off-limits to drilling." ere President Trump able to get away with this, the country would lose an important tool for protecting its vital interest in clean and vibrant oceans and coasts," Niel Lawrence, NRDC's Alaska director, told Bloomberg." y now it's clear there is no legitimate public interest in further expanding risk to our oceans in pursuit of fossil fuels that we don't need," Lawrence said.

69	foxnews	right_bias	2019-04-29	California Gov. Newsom facing new pressure from environmental groups to block drilling, fracking In the next few weeks, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is slated to announce his administration's energy policy strategy – and many environmental groups there are hoping it will include plans to end oil and gas drilling in the nation's most populous state and phase out all fossil fuel extraction. At the very least, green groups are hoping that Newsom – who campaigned last year on a promise to end controversial extraction methods like fracking and who has been a key figure in the fight to curtail climate change – will create buffer zones for any new oil and gas wells near schools, hospitals and residential neighborhoods and also monitor for dangerous emissions from plugged or abandoned wells."  consider to remain optimistic given how he expressed interest in issues that [former California Gov. Jerry] Brown did not address," Kathryn Phillips, the director of the Sierra Club California, told Fox News. "The governor needs to make a plan to transition the state away from oil and gas toward renewables, but also transition workers into jobs in that sector." But as Newsom's term in Sacramento approaches its fifth month, many of these groups are losing patience as the governor tries to balance a clean energy agenda with the demands of an industry that supports hundreds of thousands of jobs in a state with around 26 million vehicles on the road." 'm taking a very pragmatic look at it, in scoping this," Newsom told The Los Angeles Times recently. "It's also an inclusive scoping because it includes people in the industry, that have jobs; communities that are impacted from an environmental justice prism but also from an economic justice prism. It's a challenging issue." Newsom must now weigh the support he received from environmental groups while on the campaign trail – and his own assurances that he wants California to be powered 100 percent by renewable energy in the near future – with any moves that could negatively affect a billion-dollar industry in a state that has the world's fifth largest economy. Even with California's oil production being in decline for years, the state was the nation's fifth-largest domestic crude oil producer in 2017, according to figures compiled by the federal government." is intentions are very pragmatic," Catherine Reheis-Boyd, the president of the Western States Petroleum Association, told Fox News. "Newsom understands the importance of an industry to the 40 million people who will be driving 26 million combustible engines tomorrow." One practice that environmental groups are hoping Newsom will clamp down on more than his predecessor is hydraulic fracturing. Known more popularly as fracking, it is a method of oil and gas extraction in which large volumes of high-pressure water are shot into the ground. Fracking has come under intense scrutiny in recent years amid widespread concerns over both the public health and environmental risks it poses. While Brown approved restrictions on the practice back in 2013, he was lambasted by green groups for not banning fracking outright amid his argument that it could provide economic opportunities to some Californians. On the campaign trail last year Newsom was adamantly opposed to fracking, but has so far remained quiet about the practice – along with the possibility of banning offshore drilling in the state - when discussing his energy agenda. Newsom, however, told the "Los Angeles Times" that despite his commitment to renewable energies, it would be impossible to completely stop California's reliance on fossil fuels at the moment." ne cannot just turn off the switch. One cannot just immediately abut against a century of practice and policy," Newsom said. Still California is one of the nation's leaders in pushing forth a green energy agenda. Despite the criticism leveled against him for waffling on clamping down on the fossil fuel industry, Brown last year signed two pieces of legislation that effectively banned the construction of any new offshore oil and gas pipelines in the state's waters and thwarted a Trump administration plan to open nearly 1.7 billion acres of coastal waters to drilling. While California cannot directly block oil and gas drilling off its coast, the legislation that Brown signed aims to drive up the operating costs of these operations enough to make the effort unprofitable. The law does this by blocking state land managers from permitting the construction of new pipelines, piers, wharves or other infrastructure projects necessary to bring oil and gas from offshore drilling sites to land." alifornia has positioned itself as the center of the Trump resistance," Jessica Levinson, a clinical law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, told Fox News. "It's bloody combat." California banned offshore drilling in state waters out to three miles back in 1994 and there haven't been any new platforms built in the last 30 years. But California is the nation's third-largest oil-producing state, behind Texas and North Dakota, and there are still 32 offshore oil platforms and artificial islands in federal and state waters off the coasts of Santa Barbara, Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange Counties. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPCalifornia may be leading the nation in curbing its reliance on fossil fuels and many environmental activists believe Newsom will take even bolder steps than his predecessor, energy industry insiders like Reheis-Boyd question what the point is when other states – and nations – are not doing their part as well."  get the idea of taking a lead on this issue and I think many companies agree with this," she said. "But at what cost is this being done, especially when nobody else is doing anything."	True	False	True	False	True

This week, Bernie met Britta. Britta is concerned about climate change, in particular you nasty, vile carnivores out there. Britta used her one opportunity to quiz a presidential candidate to ask about…meat." kay. Okay. One second while I get my question. Okay, so as you probably know, animal agriculture is to blame for the majority of climate change and is the leading cause of deforestation, water and air pollution, and biodiversity loss. With that being known, what do you plan on doing to ensure that Americans limit their consumption of animal products?""Climate change is the leading cause of every bad thing on the earth" is one hell of a "You probably already know", Britta. Got any facts to back that up or are we just making assumptions? Because, as the great Samuel L. Jackson once uttered on film, "Never make assumptions. They only end up making an ass out of 'u' and 'mption'". But Britta doesn't stop there. She goes on to cite Germany as a shining example of who we should want to be like. You may be completely shocked to learn that Bernie Sanders responded by affirming that indeed, America needs to be more like the nation that brought us Hitler, the Holocaust and the VW Bug (only one of those things is good, by the way. In case you needed some clarity). Sanders did not say outright that a meat tax is an official policy of his platform, but he did give it the old politician shine, indicating that he would support such a notion and that also he's interested in "helping" farmers become more "aggressive" about combatting climate change. Yes, I'm sure farmers will be very excited for your "help" which will be tantamount to them giving up their land, their livestock and their livelihood, effectively causing a nationwide famine but hey…socialists got to socialist." hank you for the question and it's a good question. All I can say is, if we believe, as I do and you do, that climate change is real, we're going to have to tackle it in every single area, including agriculture. Okay? And in fact, one of the things we want to do with our farmers out there is help them become more aggressive and able to help us combat climate change rather than contribute to it. So we will certainly — you're right, we've got to look at agriculture, we've got to look at every cause of the crisis that we face." No word yet on if Sanders will be getting equally "aggressive" with his own multiple vacation properties.	False	True	True	False	False
