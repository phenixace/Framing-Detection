(1) For Britain to declare a "climate and ecological emergency," (2) for Britain to commit to net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2025, and (3) for a special climate-change "citizens' assembly" to decide future environmental policies. When do they want it? Now." e are now facing an existential crisis, the climate crisis and ecological crisis which have never been treated as crises before, they have been ignored for decades," said Greta Thunberg, a Swedish activist, addressing London demonstrators. "And for way too long the politicians and the people in power have gotten away with not doing anything." Now, if Ms. Thunberg — who is 16 years old — had been addressing Chinese, American, or Indian protesters, I might have had some sympathy. But to suggest that Britain has "ignored [climate change] for decades" is simply untrue. Since 1990, the country has achieved a 38 percent decrease in carbon dioxide emissions and has reduced its annual emissions by more than 43 percent (this, despite considerable economic growth). While the Paris Agreement sets the aim for net zero carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2050 and net zero greenhouse gases by 2070, Parliament in 2008 introduced the Climate Change Act, which commits the United Kingdom to reducing its annual emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050. The U.K. has also removed coal as a major electricity source.I am sympathetic to the first of their aims: making the environment a political priority and declaring climate change to be a global emergency. (Scientists may not be infallible, but I've seen no credible argument for why they are all wrong in the same way.)However, much like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal, the demands of the Extinction Rebellion are risibly overreaching and counterproductive. In fact, their demands could be realized only through an immediate economic overhaul by people who have yet to prove their competence. Recall the five goals set out in the Green New Deal as part of a ten-year plan. First, to achieve net zero greenhouse-gas emissions while providing quality jobs for all. Second, to guarantee millions of good, high-wage jobs and economic security. Third, to invest and update industry and infrastructure. Fourth, to secure healthy food and a livable climate for everyone. Fifth, to end oppression and bring about the redistribution of power. Recall, also, the much-criticized supporting FAQ materials produced by Ocasio-Cortez's office. Embarrassing clauses about "farting cows," airplanes, and those "unwilling to work" aside, this document was illuminating because it showed that those who devised the Green New Deal have, in practical terms, no clue what they are doing. The same is true of the Extinction Rebellion. The entire spectacle has been highly disruptive for businesses and law enforcement alone." 'm extremely concerned about the impact that the protests are having on our ability to tackle issues like violent crime if they continue any longer," said Sadiq Khan, London's mayor, who has estimated that around 9,000 police officers have been dispatched to deal with the protesters.

It is often felt that sustainability is not compatible with the luxury end of the hospitality market, but The Brando proves it is possible," says Prof Graham Miller, who holds a chair in sustainability in business at the University of Surrey.	Technology could help here, too.	Mosquitoes are not the only pests the Tetiaroa Society is working to eradicate.	It's a bit like putting the island through a scanner."		The sea-cooled eco-resort that's nearly mosquito-free The Brando is one of the most luxurious eco-resorts on the planet, nestling on an atoll in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. It's the last place you might think to find pioneering technology. But you'd be surprised. The Brando resort on Tetiaroa - a stunning atoll north of Tahiti - is the epitome of luxurious exclusivity. Two-room bungalows start from €3,700 (£3,200) a night. Formerly owned by Hollywood legend Marlon Brando, who was keen that it should become an ecological haven, it has now developed in to a hideaway for the rich and famous seeking conscience-soothing holidays that do less harm to the planet. While some have dismissed the resort as an "island for liberal elites" - Beyoncé and Barack Obama were recent guests - current owner Richard Bailey claims it is close to becoming "carbon neutral and self-sustainable". Electricity at the complex, for example, is generated from solar panels and coconut oil biofuel, while waste water is used for sustainable irrigation. And the resort's cooling system uses a "closed loop heat exchanger" that takes very cold sea water from 900m (2,950ft) below the surface of the Pacific Ocean to cool the fresh water and air circulating round the complex. As the cooling system is powered largely by water pressure, it uses very little energy." It is often felt that sustainability is not compatible with the luxury end of the hospitality market, but The Brando proves it is possible," says Prof Graham Miller, who holds a chair in sustainability in business at the University of Surrey. But, of course, visitors to The Brando have to fly to Tahiti first then take another "20-minute flight to paradise", so their carbon footprint is still significant. The well-heeled guests are unlikely to be bitten by mosquitoes either, due to a sterilisation programme that has slashed Tetiaroa's mosquito population by at least 95%. Led by Dr Hervé Bossin of the Institut Louis Malardé, the programme breeds and releases non-biting male mosquitoes infected with a Wolbachia virus that makes wild females - who do bite - sterile. Similar initiatives, aimed at stamping out diseases such as Dengue and Zika, are underway in countries such as Australia, Colombia and China. But few countries have enjoyed the same level of success as Tetiaroa, where mosquito levels are now so low "the team is simply not catching any wild females anymore", according to Frank Murphy, executive director of the Tetiaroa Society, the non-governmental organisation (NGO) overseeing the sterilisation programme." The success of the project recently convinced the local government to fund a much larger breeding facility that could see the programme expand to other Pacific islands," he says. Mosquitoes are not the only pests the Tetiaroa Society is working to eradicate. Rats are a big problem for the ecosystem of the atoll." Rats eat everything from baby turtles to sea birds, and that is bad news for the coral reef too," Mr Murphy says. Technology could help here, too. The team wants to use 2.2m-diameter drones to drop poisonous bait designed to attract rats but not other species. The operation, only the second ever, will be led by Island Conservation, a US NGO that protects endangered species by removing invasive ones." Rats can cause the collapse of the entire terrestrial ecosystem," says Island Conservation's Sally Esposito." In the past, we have used helicopters to spread bait, but we recently used drones for the first time on Seymour Norte in the Galapagos Islands." Tetiaroa is a more difficult environment, so it's a great opportunity to test the drones further, and should help us to create a haven for endangered native species, such as the Polynesian Ground-dove and the Tuamotu Sandpiper." Perhaps the most futuristic project on Tetiaroa is the Island Digital Ecosystem Avatar, which uses light detection and ranging (Lidar) surveys to create a 3D model. Other data, about animals, plants, topography, and so on, will be incorporated, to create a model that could be used to predict how the island might react in different scenarios, from flooding to the introduction of new species." The Lidar surveys give us a 3D representation of the physical contours of the island, including the soils," says Tetiaroa Society scientific director Neil Davies - a senior fellow at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science." It's a bit like putting the island through a scanner." The team's eventual aim is to capture the atoll's whole ecosystem - "from molecule upwards" - so it can help local governments and communities evaluate future risks and make better decisions. Eco-tourism is a growing trend that resorts are seeking to exploit around the world, as people seek to make more responsible choices in the face of climate change. For example, the Parkside Hotel & Spa in Canada, along with The Brando, is one of just a handful of resorts to attain the US Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design platinum certification. It has a 290 sq m (3,000 sq ft) vegetated roof, and uses ponds and storm water storage tanks as a heat sink for its air conditioning system. And actor Leonardo DiCaprio, a high-profile environmental campaigner and The Brando regular - is set to open his Blackadore Caye eco-island resort off Belize in 2020. But with tourism contributing around 8% to global greenhouse gas emissions, according to one recent paper published in the scientific journal Nature Climate Change, all resorts will need to become carbon neutral, not just those targeting the world's rich.

The study is one of several to address the "carbon budget", which - among other things - determines how much CO2 the planet can emit and still reach a given limit for global warming. It indicates the 2015 target, perceived by some as tough, could be met with very stringent emissions cuts. It used computer models that project climate behaviour into the future. The aim of the Paris deal was "holding the increase in global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5C." But scientists admit they were taken by surprise by the ambition of the 1.5C figure. The results of the work with computer models have been published in Nature Geoscience. This type of work necessarily contains uncertainties regarding the way the Earth's climate will respond in future and how quickly societies can move away from fossil fuel use. But the study authors say: "Pursuing 'efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C' is not chasing a geophysical impossibility". Co-author Michael Grubb, from University College London, said: "This paper shows that the Paris goals are within reach, but clarifies what the commitment to 'pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C' really implies." Those commitments would require strengthening the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - the pledges to cut emissions contained in the Paris agreement. Previous estimates of the remaining 1.5C carbon budget based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Fifth Assessment of the climate were around four times lower. But unlike those figures, which relied on one line of evidence, the new study uses multiple approaches to examine the question and comes up with a rather different result. Co-author Prof Pierre Friedlingstein, from the University of Exeter, said: "This is very good news for the achievability of the Paris targets." Prof Myles Allen, another author from the University of Oxford, told BBC News: "In the main body of the IPCC assessment, what it would take to meet a 1.5C goal wasn't assessed in any detail. To be honest, it wasn't thought to be the policy priority at the time." Perhaps it should have been, but that was the view of the academic community then. But the ambition of Paris caught a lot of people by surprise." The climate models are exaggerating. The predictions are too alarmist. The Tuvaluans and other islanders are safer than we thought. These are among the conclusions that some might reach from this latest work. In reality, nothing is quite that straightforward. The models are simulated approximations of possible futures. Inevitably they are going to be at least slightly adrift of reality, either in the amount of warming or its timing. They come with caveats and margins of error. In many ways, it's remarkable that these computer constructs are even roughly on track. And models designed to come up with very broad potential outcomes for the end of the century may not be fine-tuned enough to give more detailed forecasts year-by-year. The authors themselves are anxious that their research is not misunderstood. The need for urgent action to reduce emissions is unchanged, they say. It's just that the most ambitious of the Paris Agreement targets is not as unachievable as many once thought, that there is time to act, though the task remains a monumental one. Myles Allen added: "For a two in three chance of keeping temperatures within 1.5C, we'd have to reduce emissions in a straight line to zero from where we are now over the next 40 years." It's possible, but extremely challenging. So if people are saying: can we now relax? That's not the right message to take at all." Scientists agree urgent action will be needed to tackle the effects of rapid temperature increase over the next century. But a study earlier this year suggested the allowable carbon budget had probably been overestimated. It said the "pre-industrial baseline" used to benchmark present day warming was probably older than the IPCC had assumed. Therefore, the degree of warming since that baseline was probably greater than had been believed. On Twitter, one of the authors of that report, Prof Michael Mann, said the latest research in Nature Geoscience, "doesn't account for [the] pre-industrial baseline issue we examined". He added: "There is some debate about [the] precise amount of committed warming if we cease emitting carbon immediately. We're probably very close to 1.5C." Meanwhile, another study in Nature Geoscience, by Gunnar Myhre, from the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research, in Oslo, and colleagues, suggests the greenhouse effect caused by human-induced CO2 emissions is now half-way to doubling compared with pre-industrial conditions. Although the concentrations themselves have not yet reached the halfway mark, this is being described as an iconic watermark.	False

Bill Nye Brilliantly Quotes The Constitution To Prove That Trump Must Act On Climate Change As thousands of activists and scientists around the world gather to March for Science, Bill Nye has a U.S. Constitution lesson for Donald Trump that proves he must advance scientific causes. In an interview on MSNBC's AM Joy, Nye said that it explicitly states in the Constitution that the U.S. government must "promote the progress of science and useful arts," something the Trump administration isn't even close to upholding. Nye had a reminder for the Trump administration:I just want to remind the administration that science is political. It is inherently political like everything else … It's in the U.S. Constitution, Article 1, Section 8, to promote the progress of science and useful arts. And my interpretation of the expression 'useful arts' is engineering. In those days, it would be architecture, city planning, designing of the drainage systems, sewage systems, and communications systems. This is all in the U.S. Constitution … That's what enables innovation, and if our country stops innovating, it will not be able to compete worldwide. Nye said that solutions to battling climate change are realistic and doable if the United States simply puts resources toward the effort and decides to act." e could get to 80 percent renewables in the next 15 years, we could 100 percent renewable in the next 30 years and we wouldn't have to have a military on the other side of the world protecting oil fields so that we could get our fossil fuels here in North America," he said. Once again, the biggest hurdle in battling climate change isn't the existence of feasible solutions – those already exist. The problem, at least in the United States, is Republicans in Congress and now the White House – especially Trump, who believes climates change is a hoax – who continue to deny that the climate crisis is happening in the first place, despite the overwhelming evidence.

The picture has since been removed. The imagery of pigs feeding at a trough has long been used to describe special interest groups trying to syphon off government spending. State spending seen as wasteful or geared toward a special interest is often called "pork" or "pork barrel" spending. However, UW students and climate activists claimed it was "racist."I-1631 campaigner Izzy Goodman tweeted in October that "this alone proves that he is a blatant racist (which is probably why his climate policies are too!)." She later added, "[UW] you going to stand for this?"When Mass tried to reason with her, UW philosophy Ph.D. candidate Alex Lenferna tweeted, "Calling you racist for saying racist things is not name calling, it's an accurate description." The post showed Mass's "small [government], racist, anti-working class view," tweeted Lenferna, who also campaigned for I-1631. Student activists didn't stop at Twitter insults. Curry, who spoke at length with Mass about the events, wrote, "The attacks ramped up when a group of students complained to the Assistant Dean for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion." Curry said the students accused Mass of "deception, being on the payroll of oil companies, purposely obfuscating with multiple twitter accounts, racism, misogyny, tokenism, Trumpism." Rather than meet with Cliff Mass to discuss, the Assistant Dean sent a mass email to the faculty of the Atmospheric Sciences Department" echoing student complaints," Curry wrote. The assistant dean's email claimed the blog had "imagery and text that was racially insensitive and caused offense to a significant number of members in the departmental community." The assistant dean made no attempt to contact Mass or try to "understand that there was no racism evident or intended, and that the image in question was quickly removed from the blog post," Curry wrote. The matter didn't end there, however, and Atmospheric Sciences Department Chair Dale Durran "sent a mass email to the Department faculty including the link to Lenferna's post, and voicing concern about Mass' behavior and 'racism,'" Curry noted. Durran held a faculty-wide meeting on Dec. 4. Durran reportedly took control of the meeting and even prevented Mass from finishing his opening remarks. (RELATED: Washington Governor Warns 'There Is Not Survival' From Climate Change. That Is, Unless His Policies Are Adopted)Durran "hectored Mass throughout the meeting," Curry wrote. "The activist students were true to form, hurling all kinds of insulting, personal and inappropriate remarks" as Mass sat through the inquisition. Duran was an ardent supporter of I-1631. Durran got 21 of his colleagues to sign a public letter, published in The Seattle Times in late October, endorsing the carbon tax ballot measure." ow is the time to take a big step to kick our carbon habit," Durran and his colleagues wrote. However, Curry reported that "several faculty members felt uncomfortable signing this," including one who told her they actually voted against the measure. Durran did not respond to TheDCNF's request for comment.

John Shimkus (R-Ill.), long a climate change denier who in the past has relied on Bible verses to make his case, argued against the Green New Deal at a House hearing on Wednesday. Moments after he started speaking Wednesday morning before the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rep. John Shimkus (R-Ill.) urged Democrats to "accept that proposing top-down government requirements to rapidly decarbonize the U.S. and global economies may not be the most realistic way to address the climate change problem." We should be open to the fact that wealth transfer schemes suggested in the radical policies like the Green New Deal may not be the best path," said Shimkus, who less than a decade ago deployed Bible verses to dismiss the realities of climate science. Two congressional hearings on Wednesday morning ― the first science-based discussions in the House focused on climate change in years ― did little to move the needle on a long-stagnant policy debate on how to keep global warming from reaching temperatures with catastrophic consequences. But GOP opposition to a Green New Deal, the grassroots effort to dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions that has energized activists for months, was on full display. Once a vague term for clean-energy stimulus, the Green New Deal re-emerged in the political discourse in mid-2018. A cadre of left-wing Democratic candidates began using it to describe plans to spend trillions of dollars on a national industrial strategy to zero out fossil fuel emissions and power the country with 100 percent renewables in a decade. The proposals electrified a static debate that too often ranged from outright denialism of climate change by some to dubious market fixes offered by others. Scientists quickly praised the idea of a Green New Deal as the first policy on the scale of the climate crisis. In November, newly elected Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) positioned herself as the champion of the Green New Deal movement. After failing to persuade House Democratic leaders to establish a select committee on a Green New Deal, she began work on a sweeping new resolution outlining a transformative policy to guarantee high-wage clean energy jobs to millions of Americans and upgrade the nation's crumbling infrastructure to withstand already-unavoidable extreme weather and sea level rise. Despite years of partisan bickering over the realities of climate change, the idea proved popular. Eighty-one percent of registered voters said they supported the main goals of the Green New Deal in a poll released in December. That included 64 percent of Republicans and 57 percent of self-described conservative Republicans. Last month, another poll found a narrow majority of voters said they supported a Green New Deal even if it required raising taxes to fund it. Rich Powell, the executive director of the conservative clean energy advocacy group ClearPath, complained that the emissions projected to come from new coal-fired plants in other countries, particularly India and China, would "completely offset" the climate benefits of the U.S. completely decarbonizing. As HuffPost reported on Tuesday, the Green New Deal resolution Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) are expected to unveil this week does just that, calling on the nation to "promote the international exchange of technology, expertise, products, funding and services with the aim to reclaim U.S. leadership on climate change to help other countries achieve a Green New Deal." You only have to be 25 years old to be a member of Congress. We have young people that bring a lot of great qualities, but maybe they don't bring a lot of life experience," he said. "I guess I can understand if someone has not had a lot of life experience and they're proposing something that's extremely unrealistic ― well, impossible. Impossible." What I don't understand is adults and grownups, who are older and more mature, who are also advocating something that's impossible," he added, referring to several of the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) resorted to misrepresenting the Green New Del proposal in arguing against it. He said he and other Republicans "have real concerns" about shuttering military bases around the globe and cutting military spending by 50 percent ― proposals floated not by any congressional Democrats in the climate change debate but by Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein in 2016. Gohmert told panel witness Rev. Lennox Yearwood, president of the national, nonprofit Hip Hop Caucus, that he found it "interesting" at the activist would support a Green New Deal, given Yearwood's previous service as an officer in the U.S. Air Force Reserve Chaplain Corps.

The warning came weeks after Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said he wants to open nearly all U.S. coastlines to offshore oil and gas drilling. Since then, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has proposed six sales of drilling rights off the California coast and a seventh off Oregon and Washington between 2020 and 2023." iven how unpopular oil development in coastal waters is in California, it is certain that the state would not approve new pipelines or allow the use of existing pipelines to transport oil from new leases onshore," the State Lands Commission wrote in a letter Wednesday to federal officials. The commission controls up to 3 miles offshore, at which point federal jurisdiction kicks in. It has not allowed drilling in the state-controlled waters since a 1969 oil spill near Santa Barbara. State and local governments could also block the construction of helipads and other infrastructure on land needed to support offshore operations. In the 1980s, many coastal cities passed ordinances to block such infrastructure when President Ronald Reagan looked to expand offshore drilling. Many of those laws remain in place. Drillers could find ways around state and local restrictions — such as pumping oil directly onto ships for transport — but the process is expensive and may not be profitable if oil prices remain relatively low.A separate letter from the California Coastal Commission warned that an oil spill would devastate the state's tourism economy and coastal beauty. The letter pointed to the Santa Barbara spill, which caused severe environmental damage, hurt the fishing industry and dissuaded tourists from visiting. The commission has authority to review activities in federally controlled waters. It can't block drilling but could file a lawsuit contending the move doesn't meet ocean management plans approved jointly by the state and federal governments in the 1970s." e've fought similar efforts before, and we will fight them again," Coastal Commission Chair Dayna Bochco said. The state agencies weighed in ahead of a public meeting Thursday in Sacramento, the only opportunity for people to register their opinions in person to the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. Fishermen, environmentalists, surfers and other critics demonstrated outside the state Capitol before marching to the meeting at a nearby library. Several demonstrators chanted in opposition at the open-house style meeting, where bureau scientists talked one-on-one with visitors and collected written comments." hy do we want to let someone start drilling for more oil when we need to be putting money into resources for green economy and green fuel," said Jim Wilson, a 71-year-old retired mail carrier from Placerville, outside Sacramento. Earlier in the day, the California Assembly voted overwhelmingly to oppose renewed drilling." e are California and we will fight back to protect our beautiful coast," said Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi of Torrance. Republicans Randy Voepel of Santee and Travis Allen of Huntington Beach said California can safely harvest oil and gas. Allen, a GOP candidate for governor, said that could help lower gasoline prices. Most of California's outer continental shelf – the area that would be opened to drilling – is in shallow water, where operations are not complicated, said Tim Charters, senior director of government and political affairs for the National Ocean Industries Association, a trade group for the offshore energy industry." t's critical to keep the dollars at home, create the jobs locally instead of sending the money overseas and creating jobs in foreign places," he said. Zinke angered critics when he said drilling off Florida's coast would remain off limits, prompting California Gov. Jerry Brown and others to request a similar exemption. Regulators later said no final decision had been made about Florida. On Tuesday, more than 100 demonstrators gathered outside Oregon's state Capitol in Salem to denounce the proposal. A day later in New Jersey, more than a dozen groups held a rally in the driving rain on the Asbury Park boardwalk to demonstrate their opposition.

Asked on Saturday whether he thought climate change had a role in the fires, he said "you have a lot of factors".

I have a strong opinion.		California fires: death toll rises to 79 as winds threaten efforts to control blaze Strong winds on Sunday were expected to hamper progress for crews battling California wildfires which have now claimed at least 79 lives. Gusts of up to 50mph were threatening efforts to control the Camp blaze, which is still only 55% contained 10 days after it brought devastation to northern California. The fire which destroyed nearly 10,000 homes and has spread across 233sq miles is already the deadliest American wildfire in a century. And there are fears that the eventual death toll will rise much higher, with almost 1,300 people still unaccounted for. However, it seems likely that number of missing persons may be an over-estimate amid confusion over the way the list has been compiled. Butte county sheriff Kory Honea has stressed that the roster has been built up from missing person reports from calls, reports and emails since the fire began on 8 November. He has described it as "raw data" and said "there is the likely possibility that the list contains duplicate names" and some evacuees who have not reported themselves safe. California's outgoing Democratic governor Jerry Brown visited the scene of devastation at the town of Paradise with Donald Trump on Saturday. He told CBS's Face the Nation that Trump has "got our back" and has committed emergency support. Trump initially blamed state officials for poor forest management in making the fires in northern and southern California worse and even threatened to cut off federal funding. At the scene on Saturday, Trump recounted a conversation he had in Paris on 11 November with Finland's president Sauli Niinisto, who talked about monitoring forest resources with a good surveillance system. Trump said wildfires weren't a problem in Finland because the Finns "spend a lot of time on raking" leaves and "cleaning and doing things". But Sauli Niinistö, president of Finland, told one of the country's leading newspapers, Ilta-Sanomat, on Sunday that he never discussed raking with Trump."  mentioned [to] him that Finland is a land covered by forests and we also have a good monitoring system and network," Niinistö said, but had no recollection of mentioning raking of leaves or forest undergrowth, which the president appears to have seized on as a key point in wildfire prevention, while dismissing the issue of global warming. Asked on Saturday whether he thought climate change had a role in the fires, he said "you have a lot of factors". And asked if seeing the devastation changed his mind on climate change, Trump said: "No. No. I have a strong opinion. I want great climate. We're going to have that." Jerry Brown, in the interview aired on Sunday, said: "Changing climate and the increasing drought and the lower humidity and water vapor" were important factors. He said: "Managing the forest is part of it. They're a lot denser than they were 200 years ago. But on top of that, we have this five year drought. We have reduced rainfall. We have the dryness that turns vegetation and bushes and houses and trees into – literally into timber. So it's ready to explode. So there is an atmospheric element which is part of the natural cycle and then there is an increasing effect of climate change." But asked if he had made that case to Trump, he said: "I certainly raised it but I didn't feel that that was where we needed to go," then added that science would be the guide for analysing the fires "and the president in no way negated that".

The comments by Rep. José Serrano, D-N.Y., chairman of a House Appropriations subcommittee overseeing federal climate funding, came amid news reports that White House officials are putting together a national security advisory panel aimed at countering the science behind human-caused global warming. The panel's findings could give President Donald Trump, who has challenged his own government's conclusions about the causes of and threats from climate change, more ammunition to ignore it. Serrano, who chairs the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, said that would be perilous." This unaccountable working group appears set to deliberately cherry-pick data and science with the sole purpose of pushing back against the widely accepted science around climate change," he said at a hearing Tuesday that featured government scientists testifying on the crisis. "This only serves to diminish the magnitude of this crisis, and it is dangerous." Shortly after Serrano spoke, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., announced Senate Democrats are drafting legislation that would block the White House from creating the panel." This is maybe the most conspicuous symptom of a disease of climate denial that has infected the Republican Party and the hard right," Schumer said at a Capitol Hill news conference. The science is largely settled on climate change and the threats it poses the panel. But the public relations war over how to address it is heating up as both sides navigate an issue expected to be a top issue in the 2020 election. Democrats who retook the House following the 2018 midterm election have been holding numerous hearings on the crisis. Republicans, in turn, have accused Democrats of trying to use climate change to impose a leftist agenda that would ruin the economy. In early February, progressive Democrats unveiled their Green New Deal to remake the American economy into a social justice model focused on clean energy. But moderate Democrats have distanced themselves from the broadly worded plan that also calls for free housing, health care and higher education for all Americans, preferring only to endorse the portions that directly address climate change.

The report "is a comprehensive, scientifically rigorously analysis and assessment if the available information primarily from the U.S. government," Freilich said. "We have made measurements of many climate indicators and many of the Earth's systems and it is clear that the climate is changing." David Doniger, a climate change expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council, said he was not worried about the administration's efforts to discredit the science given the preponderance of evidence."

Clean water: the latest casualty in Trump's attack on the environment |  Ross Barkan The cruelty and the idiocy of Donald Trump's presidency does not chiefly liein his tweets or even his words. Trump the performer is ridiculous, but that'sthe clown show that keeps many of us either terrified or entertained – thereal harm is elsewhere, away from the blaring headlines. Trump has been most destructive in his willingness to carry out an unabashedlyrightwing policy agenda. Most Republicans competing for the nomination in 2016embraced their party's total capitulation to the fossil fuel industry, denyingthe existence of climate change and promising to shred EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) regulations. This is a central threat to America'sfuture: a major, powerful political party rejecting science itself. This week, the Trump administration said it would ) designed to protect millions of acres ofwetlands and thousands of miles of streams from pesticide runoff and otherpollutants. This proposal would not just undo Obama-era regulations but chipaway at protections instituted under the late George HW Bush, perhaps the lastmajor Republican to pay even lip service to the environment. The Obama era rule was designed to limit pollution in about 60% of thenation's bodies of water, protecting sources of drinking water for about athird of the United States. Federal authority was extended to limit pollutionin large bodies of waters and smaller bodies that drain into them, likestreams and wetlands. Rural landowners complained about the governmentregulating how much pollution from chemical fertilizers and pesticides couldseep into water on their property. Real estate developers and owners of golf courses attacked the waterregulations too, and cheered the news that Trump, a fan of both real estatedevelopment and golf, was delivering on a campaign promise. The protection ofour water, they figure, shouldn't interfere with business. Not only will it soon be easier for pollution to seep into our waterways, if adeveloper finds a wetland is in the way of a money-making opportunity, thehabitat can be paved over altogether. Wetlands adjacent to a major body ofwater will warrant federal protection. The rest are fair game. Environmentalists are rightfully horrified and fearful of what's to come. It'snot just clean drinking water the Trump White House has disregarded. Proposalshave circulated to weaken regulations on planet-warming emissions from powerplants, oil rigs, and cars. Trump is trying to speed new drilling at theArctic national wildlife refuge. As climate change accelerates and the planethurdles ever closer to an existential crisis, Trump went to a United Nationsconference to ) of fossil fuels. The current administrator of the EPA, Andrew Wheeler, used to spend his timelobbying against environmental regulations on behalf of coal magnate Robert EMurray. He was chief counsel to Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, a prouddenier of climate change. Democrats hoping Trump is impeached, indicted or somehow toppled before 2020should understand even such farfetched scenarios won't change the status quo. Trump has surrounded himself with people who care far more about the sanctityof fossil fuel profits than the safety of the American people. They worship atthe altar of nihilistic capitalism. Mike Pence won't save you. For 2020 and beyond, climate justice will have to become the most animatingissue for Democrats – not because it's a "winning" argument, though it is, butbecause the future of the planet depends on it.

And Carlos Curbelo, a House Republican who proposed a carbon tax, was outflanked by his Democratic opponent Debbie Mucarsel-Powell.	)Several state clean energy and environmental ballot initiatives were also thwarted at the polls.		Governors could drive the next wave of climate change action Environmentalists lamenting that a green wave didn't wash over Congress can find a glimmer of hope in the results of several key governor races. As of Wednesday, it looks like Democrats committed to fighting climate change gained several key governorships that could accelerate local and national progress in clean energy. Democrat Stephen Sisolak won in Nevada, Democrat Janet Mills won in Maine, and Democrat Michelle Lujan Grisham won in New Mexico. In the past two years, these states all passed renewable energy bills through their legislatures that were vetoed by Republican governors. But with these Democrats now heading into the governors' mansions, it's very likely that these states will take another run at clean energy legislation. Sisolak, for example, campaigned on his support Question 6, one of the few state clean energy ballot initiatives that passed on Tuesday. This is a ballot measure that commits Nevada to getting 50 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. "In fact, as governor, I would like to get us on the road to 100 percent," Sisolak said in a campaign ad. Meanwhile Mills's platform included cutting Maine's greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2030. And Grisham advocated new rules to regulate methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and has a long voting record in the House as a representative of New Mexico in favor of bills to address climate change. Democrats flipped executive offices in other states as well. Democrat Tony Evers, Wisconsin's governor-elect, defeated incumbent Scott Walker on a platform that included a pledge to join 17 other governors committed to the goals of the Paris climate agreement. These wins are critical because governors have executive authority that allows them to dictate some state energy priorities. They also play a huge role in how federal environmental laws like the Clean Air Act are enforced. We saw this play out in North Carolina after the last election. The state passed a law in 2012 preventing the government from even considering the latest climate change science in its planning. Then Democrat Roy Cooper was elected and pulled an aggressive U-turn, going as far as to sign an executive order committing the state to cutting its greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. In 38 states, governors also appoint utility commissioners, who shape investment in energy infrastructure and can help decide whether to keep an aging coal plant online or to rapidly deploy renewables. That gives states like Nevada another lever to drive climate policies. Legislatures in several states — Maine, Colorado, New Hampshire, Connecticut, New York, Minnesota — also saw at least one chamber flip in favor of Democrats. In 13 states, Democrats now control the governorship along with upper and lower legislative chambers. This would allow them to pass aggressive renewable portfolio standards and greenhouse gas targets. But other governors races did not go as well — one high-profile candidate who made climate change a key part of his platforms, Democratic Florida gubernatorial contender Andrew Gillum, lost. As for national-level candidates, several House members who deny climate change like California Republican Devin Nunes held on to their seats. And Carlos Curbelo, a House Republican who proposed a carbon tax, was outflanked by his Democratic opponent Debbie Mucarsel-Powell. Curbelo also chaired the House Climate Solutions Caucus. The 90-member group counted 45 Republicans as members, but just 24 of them will return in January. (Since the caucus hadn't come up with many concrete solutions yet, it's unclear what it will do going forward.)Several state clean energy and environmental ballot initiatives were also thwarted at the polls. Measures like Colorado's anti-fracking Proposition 112 and Washington state's Initiative 1631 to price carbon emissions were defeated in part due to a firehose of money being unleashed by fossil fuel interests. What that means is that the bulk of climate change and energy advances we're going to see in the United States over the next two years will come up through state legislatures and governors' offices.

Have you lost your mind? <sep> 	Scott Pruitt Continues His Favors for Big Polluters and Puts Our Families at Risk Some of the regular Americans who are paying the price for Scott Pruitt's leadership were in Washington, DC this week, and I had the honor of spending the day with them and hearing their stories. As we all know, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt headed to Capitol Hill Thursday, where he was grilled by members of Congress on his many ethical scandals that have been making headlines for weeks. Just two days earlier, people from across the US came to Washington to testify at EPA's lone public hearing on Pruitt's proposed rollbacks of protections from toxic coal ash. Their stories of coal ash contamination were heartbreaking - a North Carolina town where neighbors keep getting sick, a community on the Navajo Nation where people drive 15 miles to haul water for livestock. The EPA had finally put very modest coal ash safeguards in place for these communities in 2015, and now Scott Pruitt is trying to take them away. As I told EPA in my testimony, "Families are looking to EPA to solve the coal ash problem — not abandon them. If you don't defend these standards, the Sierra Club and our allies will." One small town Alabama mayor summed up the thoughts of everyone in the room when he faced EPA representatives a simply said, "What are you doing? Have you lost your mind?"Pruitt's maneuver to weaken coal ash standards has sparked grassroots outrage from red states and blue states. He is handing out yet another favor to the corporate polluters who've been and marching orders since he took over the EPA. Pruitt is weakening the protections so that millionaire utility executives don't have to pay for affordable, common-sense fixes to America's mounting coal ash problem. As I heard from scientists and the many families affected who spoke at the hearing earlier this week, coal ash is the primary solid waste product of coal-fired power plants and it contains some of the most dangerous toxic chemicals on earth, like arsenic, lead, mercury, and chromium. The toxins raise the risk for cancer, heart disease, and stroke, and can inflict permanent brain damage on children. It's estimated that 1.5 million children live near the coal ash storage sites, which are only getting larger with each ton of coal burned. In places like and on the , we've seen the tragedies that coal ash spills and leaks can cause by devastating communities, contaminating water, and sending people to the hospital. In 2015, after years of scientific research and public comments , the EPA finalized a set of basic clean water protections from coal ash that were cheap and easy for utilities to implement. These standards required coal-plant owners to do things like line new coal ash dump sites with strong, waterproof materials to make sure the dangerous contents of coal ash did not leach into soil and contaminate groundwater. They also provided local communities with online tools to monitor their groundwater to make sure that toxic heavy metals from nearby coal ash waste sites were not contaminating the water they used for farming, drinking, and cooking. In a cruel irony, Pruitt announced these rollbacks the day after EPA reporting under the new standard revealed dangerous coal ash pollution in more than 70 sites around the country. Everyone deserves clean water free from toxic coal ash, and the profits of utility executives should never be held in higher regard than the health of local communities.. After nearly a year in his position, Pruitt has seemed more concerned with pushing the agenda of wealthy coal executives rather than doing his job to protect the environment and the health of the people who are suffering from the pollution created by coal plants. Nothing better illustrates this than the sweetheart deal Pruitt received from the wife of a dirty energy lobbyist who had business before the EPA . For a mere $50 a night, he stayed in a plush, multi-million dollar condo near the United States Capitol. By day, Pruitt was touting his rollback efforts to make it easier for energy companies and utilities to save money by polluting, and by night, he slept peacefully in a bed owned by someone who energy companies and utilities hire to do their bidding on Capitol Hill. As each day goes by and we find out more about Pruitt's conflicts of interests and revelations about his failed judgement , however, it's important to remember that his failures have real world impacts on the health of the people he is supposed to be protecting. Real families will be hurt because of his decision to roll back the clean water protections against coal ash, people who can't offer him sweetheart deals on luxury housing. TAKE ACTION: Stop the repeal of coal ash safeguards!	True

As soon as Hurricanes Harvey and Irma made landfall in the U.S., scientists, politicians and journalists began to discuss the role of climate change in natural disasters. Although a clear scientific consensus has emerged over the past decade that climate change influences hurricanes in the long run, its effect upon any individual storm is unclear. Anyone trying to score political points after a natural disaster should take a deep breath and review the science first. As a meteorologist with access to the best weather-forecast model data available, I watched each hurricane's landfall with particular interest. Harvey and Irma broke the record 12-year major hurricane landfall drought on the U.S. coastline. Since Wilma in October 2005, 31 major hurricanes had swirled in the North Atlantic but all failed to reach the U.S. with a Category 3 or higher intensity. Even as we worked to divine exactly where the hurricanes would land, a media narrative began to form linking the devastating storms to climate change. Some found it ironic that states represented by "climate deniers" were being pummeled by hurricanes. Alarmists reveled in the irony that Houston, home to petrochemical plants, was flooded by Harvey, while others gleefully reported that President Trump's Mar-a-Lago might be inundated by Irma. How to put these two hurricanes into proper context? An informative website from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, synthesizes reams of research literature on the links between hurricanes and global warming. Over the next century, climate models generally indicate fewer but stronger storms—between 2% and 11% greater average storm intensity—with substantially increased rain rates. Against the background of slow sea-level rise, explosive coastal population growth will overwhelmingly exacerbate any hurricane's damages. In the aggregate, the global-warming signal may just now be emerging out of our noisy observational records, and we may not know certainly for several decades. These conclusions are hardly controversial in the climate-science community. My own research, cited in a recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, found that during the past half-century tropical storms and hurricanes have not shown an upward trend in frequency or accumulated energy. Instead they remain naturally variable from year-to-year. The global prevalence of the most intense storms (Category 4 and 5) has not shown a significant upward trend either. Historical observations of extreme cyclones in the 1980s, especially in the Southern Hemisphere, are in sore need of reanalysis. By focusing on whether climate change caused a hurricane, journalists fail to appreciate the complexity of extreme weather events. While most details are still hazy with the best climate modeling tools, the bigger issue than global warming is that more people are choosing to live in coastal areas, where hurricanes certainly will be most destructive. The nascent field of "attribution science" attempts to explain how climate change may affect characteristics of a given hurricane using models in "what if" mode. Such research requires a faithful reproduction of events and predictions of the future constrained by subjective choices within computer models. This research also takes time—which means other scientists must examine the evidence with patience and judiciousness not usually seen on Twitter or cable news. Still, the scientific community already knows plenty about hurricanes and climate change—knowledge it has accumulated over two decades through peer-reviewed research, academic conferences and voluminous national and international assessments. Yet climate scientists all too often speculate during interviews rather than refer to IPCC reports or their cousins from the U.S. National Climate Assessment. Some climate scientists have peddled tenuous theories with no contemporaneous research evidence. Advocacy groups package these talking points for easy consumption by journalists, who eagerly repeat them. The historical record books contain dozens of devastating hurricane landfalls over the past century, any of which, if repeated, would be catastrophic regardless of additional climate-change effects. To prepare for the next hurricane, the U.S. needs the best weather forecasts, evacuation plans and leadership. These plans should be built on sound science, not speculation, overselling or exaggeration. Hurricane science in this political climate already has enough spin.

Report Warns Of Ruinous Global Warming. Republicans Say It's 'Fantasy.' WASHINGTON ― The Republican response to an alarming new United Nations report on looming catastrophes caused by global warming suggests that little, if anything, will be done by the U.S. in the near future to address the threat of rising oceans, worsening droughts and raging wildfires." hey might as well be calling on me to sprout wings and fly to Canada for the summer," Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), a climate change skeptic, said of the actions urged by the report. Issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the report found that the world is rapidly running out of time to scale back carbon emissions to keep planetary warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. If the flow of greenhouse gases continues to stream into the atmosphere at the current rate, the IPCC determined, the global mean temperature will likely rise to the 1.5-degree mark sometime between 2030 and 2052. Such a rise in global mean temperatures within that time frame would mean calamitous flooding of small islands and major coastal metropolises like New York City, the report said. Warming beyond that level, to 2 degrees and over, would significantly exacerbate such disasters. The report's authors projected that staying at or below 1.5 degrees Celsius will require slashing the world's greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030 ― and reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 ― targets that many GOP lawmakers brushed off as infeasible." here's not enough money in the world to pay for that," Kennedy said. "That's the problem with the U.N., that they come up with these policy ideas that are just 'La La Land.'""How is that new? They've said the same thing before," Sen.

The IPCC recommended several steps needed to reverse carbon dioxide emissions, including replacing the use of fossil fuels with renewable energy such as wind and solar, as well as growing more forests, which naturally recycles CO2. It also said that employing new technologies to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere will be necessary to achieve the emissions target." e should be doing everything we can," said Natalie Mahowald, a climate scientist at Cornell University and lead author of the report's first chapter. "That's the main thing about getting to (the emmissions goal) is just how aggressively we have to act in every different sector of our society." Only one GOP senator approached by HuffPost signaled an openness to delving into the report: Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he said he was looking at the "possibility" of holding a hearing on the matter. The Senate GOP majority, likely to remain in effect after November's elections, is dominated by lawmakers skeptical of human-caused climate change, such as Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.). He once threw a snowball on the Senate floor in an attempt to prove that global warming is nothing more than a hoax. Coming from a top oil-producing state, Inhofe has long railed against the IPCC as a biased, left-wing organization. On Wednesday, he claimed that the panel, recognized by others as the world's leading authority on climate change, had been "totally discredited" and dismissed its latest findings.	True

California's Multi-Front Fight On Climate California continues to pass the most ambitious laws in the world to expand clean energy and combat climate change. This summer, in the midst of unprecedented chaos and dysfunction in Washington, California lawmakers stepped up with a bipartisan solution to one of the most pressing challenges facing our state, this nation, and the world. Cap and trade is an important tool in California's climate policy portfolio. It sends a price signal to industries to reduce their carbon pollution, while generating billions of dollars in revenue for investments in clean transportation and direct pollution reduction. However, it's hardly the only weapon in our climate arsenal, and California simply cannot meet our world-leading greenhouse gas reduction goals with cap and trade alone. In fact, the challenge before us is a case study in market failures ― to suggest that market-based policies on their own will solve this existential challenge is naïve, at best. That's why California's comprehensive suite of climate policies, including our mandates to generate clean energy, improve energy efficiency, and reduce vehicle tailpipe emissions, strikes a necessary balance between market-based and direct regulations. As California edges out the United Kingdom to become the fifth largest economy in the world, with the state unemployment rate at historic lows, sound budgeting and a robust social safety net, we've proven that strong climate and clean air policies can go hand-in-hand with economic growth. Thanks to policies mandating clean energy development, California's electric grid is one of the least carbon-intensive in the world. We've turned clean energy into a pillar of our economy that now employs over half a million Californians ― ten times the number of Americans employed in the coal industry. Clean, renewable energy is also now cheaper than fossil fuels on a straight dollar-for-dollar basis in many parts of America. That's why "red" states like Texas, Oklahoma, and Iowa are quietly spending more on zero-carbon wind energy than ever before. Clean energy isn't just good for the planet; it's good for consumers' monthly utility bills and for the economy. Setting a target of 100 percent clean, renewable energy, as my Senate Bill 100 will do if signed into law, means that California will continue to be the world's clean energy superpower. Other policies promoting energy and fuel efficiency are also major tools driving both innovation and pollution reductions. Our decades-long commitment to energy efficiency, which began with Jerry Brown's first stint as Governor, has not only kept our state's electricity consumption flat despite a steadily rising population, it has kept Californians' energy-spending among the lowest in the nation. These programs create local jobs, incentivize massive private-sector investment, and are a big reason why California remains America's capital of innovation. Most importantly, policies that directly reduce pollution are our most effective tools to improve public health and quality of life in the most disproportionately impacted communities. California is home to six of the ten most polluted cities in America for ozone and particle pollution, according to the American Lung Association. The families sick from breathing dirty air surely would not consider California's air quality regulations "superfluous". We need all of these tools to be able to reduce pollution, drive technological innovation, create jobs and expand economic growth, all while keeping costs stable for consumers and businesses. Taken together, they provide a comprehensive platform for clean energy and climate policy that can serve as a golden standard and a beacon of hope for the rest of the planet until common sense returns to the White House.

Pope implicitly criticizes U.S. for leaving Paris climate accord ROME (Reuters) – Pope Francis implicitly criticized the United States on Monday for pulling out of the Paris agreement on climate change, praising it as a means to control the devastating effects of global warming. The United States is the only country out of 195 signatories to have withdrawn from the accord, which aims to cut emissions blamed for the rise in temperatures.U.S. President Donald Trump announced the decision in June shortly after visiting the pope, a strong supporter of the deal.

These devastating images show an indigenous family surveying the ruins of their homeland in the Amazon rainforest. Surrounded by dry soil and fallen timber, their native land has been all-but destroyed by rapid deforestation. During the day, the usually-fierce sun is obscured by a thick, grey smoke caused by deliberately-lit wildfires that are raging out of control across Brazil. The smell is of barbecue, caused by vast swathes of the world's largest tropical rainforest going up in flames. Raimundo Mura, indigenous leader with the Mura tribe who live in a reserve near Humaita, Amazonas state said: 'For the forest, I will go on until my last drop of blood.'All the trees had lives, they all needed to live, each in their own place.'For us this is destruction. What is being done here is an atrocity against us.'The rainforest is home to some one million indigenous people and three million species of plants and animals. But it is being decimated at record rates – burnt or cleared for farming and mining. Scientists have recorded more than 74,000 fires in Brazil this year – an 84% increase compared to the same period last year. They can now be seen from space and have plunged the largest city Sao Paulo into darkness because of the heavy smoke. In total, the blazes have created a layer of smoke estimated to be 1.2 million square miles wide that spreads across Latin America to the Atlantic coast. Handech Wakana Mura, another local leader within the forest, said: 'With each passing day we see the destruction advance – deforestation, invasion and logging.'We are sad because the forest is dying at every moment.'We feel the climate changing and the world needs the forest.'We need the forest and our children need the forest.'Environmentalists and academics have blamed the Brazilian government, under far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, for a sharp increase in Amazon deforestation. The climate change sceptic swept to power in January promising to open up the Amazon to mining and farming. His rhetoric is said to have emboldened farmers to burn large sections of the rainforest for beef and soy production. Camila Veiga of the Brazilian Association of NGOs said: 'The fires are the consequence of a policy of environmental devastation, of support for agribusiness, of increasing pastures.'The fires have been raging for around three weeks and an area the size of a football pitch is said to be lost every minute. Global concern is growing as the rainforest is key to tackling global warming because of the way it absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen. Mr Bolsonaro largely ignored the issue at first and even attempted to blame environmental charities, accusing them of lighting the fires. Opposition MPs have said the raging infernos are a 'crime against humanity' and blamed his policies for fuelling the blazes. French President Emmanuel Macron had called the wildfires an international crisis and said the leaders of the G7 group of nations should hold urgent discussions about them during their summit in France this weekend. Mr Macron tweeted: 'Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon rain forest – the lungs which produces 20% of our planet's oxygen – is on fire.'Mr Bolsonaro hit back at Macron, complaining he was the subject of a smear campaign and the media had exploited the fires to undermine his government. His chief of staff, Onyx Lorenzoni, also accused European countries of exaggerating environmental problems in Brazil in order to disrupt its commercial interests. Relations between Europe and Brazil are at a low, which has worried the powerful agriculture sector. Last week, Norway joined Germany in halting $60 million worth of Amazon protection subsidies, accusing Brazil of turning its back on the fight against deforestation. French and German leaders have also threatened not to ratify a trade deal between the European Union and Mercosur countries (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) to pressure Brazil into complying with its environmental pledges within the Paris Climate Agreement. In contrast, the UK is currently on a trade mission in Brazil attempting to forge closer ties post-Brexit. The neighbouring country of Bolivia is also struggling with wildfires, many believed to have been set by farmers clearing land for cultivation.	True
662	The Huffington Post	left_bias	2017-10-25	On April 20, the day before the March for Science protest in Washington, D.C., New York University physicist Steve Koonin published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal calling for a red-team, blue-team exercise to "put the 'consensus' to the test, and improve public understanding, through an open, adversarial process."

The Illinois-based group, which has ties to the fossil fuel billionaires who run Koch Industries, boasted in July that the White House "reached out" for help identifying scientists for these debates. This appears to be the list the Heartland Institute provided. The names included on the list suggest that the Heartland Institute wants the debate to go directly after the scientific and legal underpinnings of the EPA's regulations on climate change. Rather than debating the regulatory approaches, they want to undermine the conclusion that climate change is a real problem. But while Trump and Pruitt have begun rolling back regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, so far they have not attempted to undo the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases pose a threat to human health and the environment ― a conclusion known as the endangerment finding. It was the EPA under George W. Bush that first made that determination in response to a 2007 Supreme Court ruling, but it never acted on that finding. The Obama EPA did, and, once that conclusion was reached, the agency was required by law to issue regulations under the Clean Air Act. Ninety-seven percent of peer-reviewed research agrees with the conclusion that burning fossil fuels, deforestation and industrial farms are enshrouding the planet in heat-trapping gases, and a research review published last November found significant flaws in the methodologies, assumptions or analyses used by the 3 percent of scientists who concluded otherwise. Calls for the red-team, blue-team exercise began in April, one month before the date marked on the top of the documents. On April 20, the day before the March for Science protest in Washington, D.C., New York University physicist Steve Koonin published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal calling for a red-team, blue-team exercise to "put the 'consensus' to the test, and improve public understanding, through an open, adversarial process." The next day, Judith Curry, a retired climatologist known for mocking other scientists as "alarmists," and Anthony Watts, who runs a popular climate change denial blog, endorsed the idea. The next week, Pruitt met with Koonin for an hour, according to schedules published by The Washington Post. The meeting included "about 40 climate scientists, economists, lawyers, and other experts to discuss the possible creation by the Trump administration of a Red Team - Blue Team exercise on climate change," he wrote. He noted this was the second "Red Team briefing," following an initial gathering on June 14 in Washington, D.C. A final summit is scheduled for Nov. 8, the day before the Heartland Institute's America First Energy Conference in Houston. This seems to be the goal of the list, which includes 145 scientists and 60 economists who have long been on the fringes of the climate debate, making their names as contrarians given to bombastic public statements. In his email, Bast said he assembled a list "of around 150 climate experts," which he sent "to folks at EPA in response to their request for recommendations." A source who requested anonymity provided the list to the watchdog Climate Investigations Center, which shared it with HuffPost." ztec priests told people they must cut out their beating hearts to bring better climate for their crops. The people believed them," he wrote in a December 2015 blog post. "Today's climate priests tell people they must cut out their CO2 emissions and pay penances to other nations, like China, to save our climate. The people believe them." I would go right down to the core, starting with the question, 'How much do human emissions increase atmospheric carbon dioxide?' That's the first assumption the blue team makes, and they have to prove that that's true," he said. "In my opinion, the red team would win that debate on the carbon dioxide." Carlin spent decades as an economist working at the EPA before becoming a conservative media darling for publicly accusing the agency of muzzling his criticism of the endangerment finding. He was never assigned to work on climate change and holds a doctorate in economics, not atmospheric science or climatology, and his comments on the finding were deemed to be the "product of rushed and at times shoddy scholarship," according to a 2009 analysis by The New York Times. Yet he submitted the 93-page report suggesting the research behind human-caused climate change is "more religion than science."	True

The "Report on Effects of a Changing Climate to the Department of Defense" does not mention Camp Lejeune, the Marine Corps, Hurricane Florence or even the threats posed by extreme weather events -- more destructive storms, more intense rainfall -- that scientists say are more likely given climate change and global warming. Those omissions are just one reason lawmakers greeted the Congressionally mandated report with eviscerating criticism on Friday. The report didn't meet the legal requirement to list the 10 most vulnerable military installations for each service, they said. And despite the global impact of climate change, it didn't list a single US military installation outside the United States.

We know that climate change is real and impacts the way our Armed Forces carry out their missions in different parts of the globe," Reed said in a statement. "Former Secretary (James) Mattis recognized and affirmed this fact." The Pentagon report follows a January study by the Government Accountability Office that found that under the Trump administration, the State Department removed guidance to overseas missions on how to include climate change risks in their country strategies, particularly in relation to migration. The Pentagon report notes that the department "is incorporating climate resilience as a cross-cutting consideration for our planning and decision-making process, and not as a separate program or specific set of actions." Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Mike Andrews said, "the effects of a changing climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to DOD missions, operational plans and installations." But Reed noted that despite legal requirements, the Pentagon report simply outlined an alphabetical list of 79 military installations. "The report reads like an introductory primer and carries about as much value as a phonebook," he said. And Rep. Jim Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat who sits on the House Armed Services Committee, said he was "deeply disappointed." Langevin noted that the "the report comes after a year where the Department suffered nearly $10 billion in damage in just two extreme events at Tyndall Air Force Base and Camp Lejeune—two installations that were not even evaluated." Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said the "report highlights the climate vulnerabilities of the top 79 mission assurance priority installations. By using this alternative approach, we are able to highlight where there are operational risks." The Pentagon did not answer multiple questions from CNN, including: why it failed to meet Congress' request to list the 10 most vulnerable installations, why it mentioned no military installations outside the US or why the climate factors it considered did not include extreme weather, and why Camp Lejeune isn't listed among the 79 installations. Babb also declined to respond to Reed's criticism. The report acknowledges that "the effects of a changing climate are a national security issue with potential impacts to Department of Defense missions, operational plans, and installations." It looks at the impact of recurrent flooding, noting that Joint Base Langley in Virginia has seen a 14-inch sea level rise since 1930. It briefly notes military installations affected drought, particularly in the southwest, and by desertification. The report touches on wildfires that came close to Space Launch complexes and a southern California base, as well as thawing permafrost in Alaska. Although no overseas military installations were listed, the report noted the widely recognized impact climate change has on fragile regions, particularly in Africa and Asia, and the instability and conflict it can create. It lists a few projects the defense department has undertaken with partner countries and notes the need to consider how drought and desertification impact overseas bases and missions. The report also raised, very briefly, the logistical challenge weather conditions can create for intelligence collection, surveillance and reconnaissance, as well as recovery and casualty evacuation. And it flagged the way climate change will create new security challenges in the Arctic, where melting ice means greater access but also greater international competition for the waterways.	True

Trump's EPA Plans To Ease Carbon Emissions Rule For New Coal Plants Trump's EPA Plans To Ease Carbon Emissions Rule For New Coal PlantsThe Trump administration plans to eliminate an Obama-era requirement that new coal-fired power plants have expensive technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions. This latest administration effort to boost fossil fuel industries comes as leaders from nearly 200 countries are meeting in Poland to discuss how to keep greenhouse gasses out of the atmosphere. And amid reports that CO2 emissions are rising again, as well as the administration's own report that climate change is causing more severe weather more frequently and could eventually hurt the U.S. economy. The Environmental Protection Agency proposal would revise its "New Source Performance Standards" for coal power plants, allowing coal-fired generators to emit more CO2 per megawatt-hour of electricity generated. This would ease an Obama-era rule that was a central target in critics' accusations of a "war on coal." The coal industry argues the existing Obama administration requirements made it all but impossible to build new coal power plants, by requiring costly technologies such as carbon capture and storage. EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist, echoed that argument in announcing the proposed rule change." By replacing onerous regulations with high, yet achievable, standards, we can continue America's historic energy production, keep energy prices affordable, and encourage new investments in cutting-edge technology that can then be exported around the world," said Wheeler. Environmental groups argue that in order to reduce climate change risks, the world will have to stop burning coal. They blasted the EPA's announcement." This is just one more foolhardy move by a misguided administration that will be judged harshly by future generations," said David Doniger, senior strategic director of the Climate & Clean Energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council." Today's proposal is nothing more than another thoughtless attempt by the Trump Administration to prop up their backwards and false narrative about reviving coal at the expense of science, public safety, and reality," said Mary Anne Hitt, senior director of Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign. In fact, it's not at all clear if the change would help the ailing coal industry. In recent years it has stopped building new plants and been shutting down old ones instead. The federal Energy Information Administration reports U.S. coal consumption has declined over the last decade and this year is expected to be at its lowest level in 39 years. Even as coal use rises in China and India, coal has struggled in the U.S. to compete with cheaper electricity produced from natural gas and renewable energy. But coal industry officials believe this rule change will still help." It does appear that this proposal would make it feasible for new coal plants to be a viable option in the future in the United States," says Michelle Bloodworth, president and CEO of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. This is the latest in a series of efforts the Trump administration has taken to help the coal business. Previous actions include relaxing Obama-era regulations on carbon emissions and mercury emissions as well as rolling back existing regulations that govern coal ash. The EPA will collect public comments on the proposal for 60 days and plans to hold a public hearing on the proposed rule change.	True

The fact that societies practising 'pastoralism' persisted in this region for so long and invested both economically and ideologically in the local landscape, does not support the scenario of over-exploitation.	Dr. Chris Brierley (UCL Geography), lead author, said: "The possibility that humans could have had a stabilising influence on the environment has significant implications.	Previous studies have put the blame for the collapse of the 'Green Sahara' onto these nomads who have often been marginalised in history, but this latest studies dispels that myth.	The spread of domestic animals across the Sahara occurred at a time of increasing climatic instability, and yet, these pastoralist populations thrived."		Humans delayed onset of Sahara desert by 500 years? The study by a team of geographers and archaeologists from UCL and King's College London, published in Nature Communications, suggests that early pastoralists in North Africa combined detailed knowledge of the environment with newly domesticated species to deal with the long-term drying trend. It is thought that early pastoralists in North Africa developed intricate ways to efficiently manage sparse vegetation and relatively dry and low fertility soils. Dr. Chris Brierley (UCL Geography), lead author, said: "The possibility that humans could have had a stabilising influence on the environment has significant implications. We contest the common narrative that past human-environment interactions must always be one of over-exploitation and degradation." The fact that societies practising 'pastoralism' persisted in this region for so long and invested both economically and ideologically in the local landscape, does not support the scenario of over-exploitation. Our study shows that increasing human population and sustainable pastoralism did not accelerate—and may even have delayed—the decline of the 'Green Sahara'." Around 8,000 years ago, the Sahara wasn't desert, but instead was a vibrant ecosystem that supported hunter-gatherers and fisherfolk. The 'Green Sahara' - the colloquial term for the African Humid Period – was the period in which North Africa became much wetter than it is today thanks to a series of monsoons. As the Earth's orbit slowly changed, the rain started to reduce, and the vegetation started to die back. Around 5,500 years ago, the ecosystem in the Sahara went into a terminal decline towards the desert we have today. Pastoralism (nomadic or semi-nomadic cattle-herders) blossomed in the Sahara from around 1000 years before that collapse. Previous studies have put the blame for the collapse of the 'Green Sahara' onto these nomads who have often been marginalised in history, but this latest studies dispels that myth. The study uses a novel climate-vegetation model to determine whether the end of the African Humid Period occurred earlier than expected. The model keeps track of variables such as vegetation and rainfall, and other processes such as the amount of energy coming from the sun, and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The model found that the 'Green Sahara' should have collapsed earlier than it did. This suggests that pastoralists lasted longer than expected and the techniques they used helped them to adapt to the environmental changes. Dr. Brierley added: "Those places where pastoralists last longer are where there are more resources. It's a good adaptation to the climate change taking place at the time. There is now work today looking at what we can learn from nomadic pastoralists, such as selective grazing strategies, which can be applied to sustainable adaption to desertification that we expect from future climate change." Dr. Katie Manning (King's College London), concluded: "Despite the largely inhospitable conditions of the Sahara today, it is not hard to find evidence of human occupation from the last 11,000 years. Thousands of rock art sites illustrate a lush environment, large-game hunting and livestock herding. The spread of domestic animals across the Sahara occurred at a time of increasing climatic instability, and yet, these pastoralist populations thrived." It is likely that strategies used by contemporary traditional herders, such as seasonal movement and selective grazing, were also used by these early pastoralists, helping to maintain an otherwise deteriorating ecosystem."

John Konkus, EPA's deputy associate administrator for public affairs, repeatedly reached out to senior staffers at the Heartland Institute, according to the emails." f you send a list, we will make sure an invitation is sent," Konkus wrote to the then Heartland president, Joseph Bast, in May 2017, seeking suggestions on scientists and economists the EPA could invite to an annual EPA public hearing on the agency's science standards. Follow-up emails show Konkus and the Heartland Institute mustering scores of potential invitees known for rejecting scientific warnings of human-caused climate change, including from groups such as Plants Need CO2, The Right Climate Stuff and Junk Science. The emails underscore how Pruitt and senior agency officials have sought to surround themselves with people who share their vision of curbing environmental regulation and enforcement, leading to complaints from environmentalists that he is ignoring the conclusions of the majority of scientists in and out of his agency, especially when it comes to climate-changing carbon emissions. They were obtained by the Environmental Defence Fund and the Southern Environmental Law Centre, which sued to enforce a Freedom of Information request. The EPA maintains close working relationships with a broad range of public and private groups, and Heartland is just one of many the agency engages with "to ensure the public is informed", said the EPA spokesman Lincoln Ferguson." t demonstrates the agency's dedication to advancing President Trump's agenda of environmental stewardship and regulatory certainty," he said. The public hearing referred to in the May 2017 email was cancelled when the EPA official who runs it fell ill, the EPA said. But Bast contended in an email sent to EPA staffers and others that the official called off the hearing after learning that climate change "sceptics planned to attend". The Heartland Institute calls itself a leading free market thinktank. It rejects decades of science saying fossil-fuel emissions are altering the climate and says on its website that curbing use of petroleum and coal to fight climate change would "squander one of America's greatest comparative advantages among the world's nations"." f course The Heartland Institute has been working with EPA on policy and personnel decisions," Tim Huelskamp, a former Kansas Republican congressman who now leads the group, said in a statement." hey recognised us as the pre-eminent organisation opposing the radical climate alarmism agenda and instead promoting sound science and policy," Huelskamp wrote. He said Heartland would continue to help Pruitt and his staff. Ferguson said Pruitt and his top officials had also met with groups known for their campaigns against climate-changing emissions and pollutants from fossil fuels, including the Moms Clean Air Force, the American Lung Association, and others. But Ben Levitan of the Environmental Defence Fund said mainstream climate-change groups have received nothing like the outreach and invitations that Heartland and other hard-right groups have been getting. Certainly, "in some ways this is normal and in the course of business that ebbs and flows with the ideology of the administration in power", said Meredith McGehee, executive director of Issue One, a not-for-profit group promoting ethical government and bipartisan political reform. An email last February shows Bast forwarded to followers an email with the line "From the White House", rallying activists to public hearings the EPA was then holding around the country on repealing an Obama-era power plan meant to curb fossil-fuel emissions. The email is signed by a Pruitt political appointee and gives the name of another EPA official for activists to call.

The Washington Post reported in September that Konkus had been scrutinising grant applications for mentions of climate change, which he reportedly calls "the double C-word".

Lakely, the Heartland spokesman, responded that he had shared the article with colleagues, "asking them to jump to your aide [sic] and defend this position".

Riding into office on the back of 14 lawsuits he filed against the EPA, Pruitt took his oath of office to uphold the laws of the land and promptly proceeded to do just the opposite. Using the mantra of "states' rights" as his corporate fig leaf and wildly accusing EPA scientists of being unscientific, he has moved to "undo, delay or otherwise block more than 30 environmental rules," according to the July 1, 2017 New York Times. His tenure thus far at the EPA is the stuff of corporate wish lists: meeting privately with the worst industrial perpetrators of silent violence (charitably described as "pollution") and huddling with industry lobbyists and corporate lawyers who are eager for Pruitt to dismantle his own agency ― the federal manager of environmental violence to air, water, soil and food. Mr. Pruitt makes himself vulnerable, with all the ex parte contacts and corporate advisors to many serious offenses, including: a) violation of the procedures of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, b) conflict of interest rules, c) violation of both criminal and civil laws by the overreaching industry lobbyists who constitute Pruitt's tight cadre of clenched-jawed political appointees. History provides precedents of how the boundless zealotry of new wrecking crews ultimately leads to self-inflicted wounds and scandals. Republicans in the House of Representatives are quite familiar with trying to impeach a civil officer. For many months prior to the November election, they were hounding, with baseless impeachment threats, John Koskinen, then-director of the IRS and one of the most honorable civil servants in a generation. So fervid and ill-tempered was their partisan zeal that they also took it out on the IRS's budget, already lower than it was several years earlier, and cut it further to the bone. This fulminating vendetta, widely reported, has led to millions of taxpayers waiting on the phone with the IRS to get served or not be served at all. Most ironically, the Republicans assured that the woefully understaffed IRS could collect even less of the estimated $350 billion in annual unpaid taxes, thereby expanding the federal deficit they so often decry for political expediency. Pruitt, like most captured corporatists, has ignored the objections to his policies from the 15,000 employees of the EPA, hoping that many will leave the agency and further weaken the environmental health and safety efforts that he abhors. He doesn't want them around because he cannot rebut their scientific arguments for retaining existing standards, which would protect our environment from deadly toxins. He is also hostile to the "precautionary principle" which shifts the burden of proof to the progenitors of new chemical or particulate or gas into the environment. When you go through the list of health standards slated for Pruitt's abolition, you wonder whether there are any limits to his cold-blooded, corporatized agenda. So extreme is his corporate ardor that there will undoubtedly be lawless actions coming from his precipitous acts – which he rightly believes will not be subject to restraint from the Trump White House or the Republican-controlled Congress. Pruitt's fevered mind thinks like this: Climate change is a hoax. Methane gas, which is 40 times more harmful to global warming than carbon dioxide, should not be subject to the modest Obama-era required disclosures. The industries that are most responsible for pollution should be in charge of their own enforcement. The EPA's already grossly inadequate budget should be cut further. Attempts to curb pollution in our air and waterways should be revoked. Pesticides like chlorpyrifos, found to be dangerous after years of study, should be pushed back for 'reconsideration' – in short to be shelved. Rules on methane leaks from drilling oil and gas wells should be obstructed through delays or revision. Pruitt had a private meeting with corporate lobbyists at Trump International Hotel, which is a venue for recurring violations of the Emoluments Clause due to its Trump-enriching expenditures by foreign interests. That's when you know that the officious Pruitt doesn't even care about appearances, much less the perils of lawless and secretive influence-peddling that enriches President Trump's investments. Members of Congress – Democratic and Republican – must ensure accountability for this rogue administrator. Take close note of his non-compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act and keep in mind that political ideologies will not protect your children or vulnerable relatives and friends form environmental toxins. Conservative lungs and other bodily organs are as vulnerable to pollution-bred terminal ailments and the violent effects of climate change, as their liberal counterparts. Let's be clear about what is at issue here. Pruitt is extinguishing life-saving and disease-preventing health standards that were vetted in open procedures, that were open to input by the commercial interested affected – which usually leads to diluting the final regulation – and which have solid scientific basis to protect vulnerable populations. Consequently, Pruitt's rollbacks, suspensions or delays, if allowed to persist and expand, will lead loss and deprivation of American lives, including children – the future of our country – thereby increasing healthcare costs, family anguish and other disruptions of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness." Pruitt and his cohorts are a clear and present danger to America. He will demonstrate in the coming weeks and months how deserving he is of impeachment in the House of Representatives and conviction in the U.S. Senate. That is, if he doesn't resign or be forced to resign due to his own cruelty, recklessness and running afoul of the law.	True

In a 54-page decision, Judge Brian Morris of the U.S. District Court in Montana granted an injunction to the Indigenous Environmental Network and Northern Plains Resource Council against the U.S. State Department, the TransCanada Keystone Pipeline, and the TransCanada Corporation. TransCanada is blocked from "engaging in any activity in furtherance of the construction or operation of Keystone and associated facilities" until the State Department can confirm that doing so would not violate the Administrative Procedure Act or the National Environmental Policy Act. Morris had ruled in August that the State Department had to reach a conclusion on the environmental impacts of the pipeline, but determined Thursday that the department's analysis had left out information he considered to be crucial. He also accused the State Department of using  "outdated information" about potential environmental impacts instead of "the best scientific and commercial data available." These omissions require a remand with instructions to the Department to satisfy its obligations under NEPA," Morris wrote. In its initial report, the State Department had said that any climate related impacts from the pipeline "would prove inconsequential." However, Morris argued that the department had not given a "reasoned explanation" for how it came to this conclusion. TransCanada has claimed that the pipeline would result in few oil spills by decreasing the amount of oil being transported by rail, and lower greenhouse gas emissions by lowering the amount of oil being transported by ocean tanker. If constructed, the Keystone XL Pipeline would stretch from Hardisty, Alberta, to Nebraska, where it would connect to an existing pipeline going to the Gulf Coast. In November 2015, former President Barack Obama's administration blocked the pipeline's construction, citing potential environmental impact. Two days after taking office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order reauthorizing the pipeline.	False

In an op-ed piece for the Guardian published on Saturday, Sanders made an economic case for a focus on industries meant to ameliorate the effects of climate change, rather than those which contribute to it. The senator from Vermont wrote: "No matter what agenda President Trump and his administration of climate deniers push, it is clear that jobs in clean energy like wind and solar are growing much more rapidly than jobs in the coal, oil and gas sectors."

Beto O'Rourke: just how green is the Texas Democrat? It was not hard for Beto O'Rourke to seem like a champion of green issues during his eye-catching Senate campaign in America's 2018 midterm elections – after all, he was up against Ted Cruz, a climate change denier. Now, as the former US congressman vies to be the Democratic candidate to run against Donald Trump in the 2020 race for the White House, he faces much closer scrutiny on the subject. Environmental advocates and experts wait to see if – as O'Rourke pivots from an election in a conservative-led oil state to a national primary race heavily influenced by left-leaning Democratic candidates – he will have more latitude and desire to put progressive green policies at the heart of his strategy." e didn't really emphasise climate change and global warming very much when he was running against Ted Cruz, but he's got a field that is absolutely filled with people who are making it a campaign item for voters to consider, and I think he's going to have to adjust his narrative when he's out on the trail," said Robert Forbis, an assistant professor of political science at Texas Tech University. "He's going to have to take a pretty strong stand." The seeds of a decisive and urgent approach were visible in his first campaign visits to Iowa in March, when O'Rourke praised the radical climate change-led proposals in the Green New Deal, citing his home state's struggles with extreme weather such as droughts and hurricanes." torms like Harvey are only going to become more frequent and more severe and more devastating and ultimately they'll compromise the ability to live in a city like Houston, Texas," he told the audience. O'Rourke signalled support for reducing the country's dependence on fossil fuels and investing in green technology to reach net zero emissions." ome will criticise the Green New Deal for being too bold or being unmanageable. I'll tell you what: I haven't seen anything better that addresses the singular crisis we face, a crisis that could at its worst lead to extinction," he said. "Literally the future of the world depends on us." Cruz held his Senate seat with a narrow win over O'Rourke last November. The Republican has dismissed climate change as a "pseudoscientific theory" and wrote an opinion article in 2017 urging Trump to rip up the landmark Paris climate agreement.O'Rourke, meanwhile, wrote a blog backing the Paris accord and during six years in Congress he successfully worked to secure federal protection for more than 7,000 acres of mountainous land on the outskirts of his native El Paso. The League of Conservation Voters' National Environmental Scorecard gives Cruz a lifetime rating of 4% based on his voting record in Congress; O'Rourke's score is 95%. Still, O'Rourke's history on environmental issues is more complex than that number might suggest – perhaps unsurprisingly for a politician who hails from west Texas. Texas has more installed wind power capacity than any other state and solar power is growing. But the state's economy is heavily dependent on the fossil fuel industry, which also wields immense political clout.O'Rourke received $476,325 in campaign contributions from oil and gas sources in the 2017-18 election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics – second nationally to Cruz, albeit not from Pacs and a small percentage of his total donations. This helped fuel accusations that O'Rourke is more of a fossil fuel ally than his lofty rhetoric might imply. The Sludge, an investigative website, reported last December that O'Rourke's Senate campaign failed to comply with a pledge not to knowingly accept contributions of more than $200 from the oil and gas industry.O'Rourke has not yet signed up to the pledge for 2020. "Already, five declared presidential candidates have officially signed the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge, meaning more than a third of declared Democratic candidates have done so," said David Turnbull, strategic communications director of Oil Change US, a group that urges politicians to commit to clean energy." e look forward to the sixth candidate signing the full No Fossil Fuel Money pledge, and we're hopeful that Beto might be that candidate."O'Rourke's campaign did not respond to questions about whether he plans to sign the pledge or how his qualified support for natural gas is compatible with the Green New Deal. In 2015, O'Rourke twice voted to repeal the nationwide ban on exporting crude oil internationally, arguing that lifting the prohibition would boost the economy and national security. "We have seen the result, which is an emergency of booming fossil fuel production here in the United States at precisely the time we need to be urgently moving away from those dirty fuels," Turnbull said." imilarly problematic, Beto has pointed to fracked natural gas as a potential part of the solution to the climate crisis when the reality is that there is simply no room for new fossil fuel development of any sort, including fracked gas. Like with his support for the removal of the crude export ban, we hope that when Beto lays out his full climate policies it will reflect the fact that we can't afford any new fossil fuels of any sort, including gas." Given Texas's critical importance to the environmental and economic future of the country, a Texas presidential candidate can deliver a powerful green narrative, said Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas, an advocacy group. "I think Texas has a real interesting story to tell in terms of our both being number one in the country for global warming pollution but also being number one for renewable energy," he said." o be able to come from Texas and show we can reduce our pollution, we can invest in clean energy … I think that's a strong message."

Cory Booker Says Any Serious Climate Plan Has to Include Nuclear Power Among the 2020 presidential candidates, Cory Booker stands out for his record of advocating for the people who bear the brunt of pollution and toxic waste. Before his presidential run, he traveled to Louisiana, North Carolina, and Alabama to inform a sweeping bill that codifies the federal government's requirement to incorporate the interests of communities of color in environmental regulation. And as the mayor of Newark, Booker tackled the city's lead water crisis and industrial pollution. Booker is also one of the few presidential contenders to embrace nuclear energy openly—his $3 trillion plan to address the climate crisis includes $20 billion in research and development of nuclear technology. This is one major difference between Booker and his opponent Bernie Sanders, who has called nuclear power a "false solution" and actually phases it out in his climate plan. The candidate sat down with Climate Desk in Anacostia, Washington, D.C. for an exclusive interview a day before the climate strikes taking place around the world. As part of the wide-ranging conversation about climate change, he explained how he squares his support for nuclear power with his passion for cleaning up pollution in disadvantaged communities."  didn't come to the United States Senate as a big nuclear guy," Booker told Grist's executive editor Nikhil Swaminathan on Thursday, "but when I started looking at the urgency of climate change, I saw that over 50 percent of our non-carbon-producing power right now comes from nuclear." Nuclear has to be a part of the blend," Booker added. "And to say it's not, to say you're going to get rid of nuclear, really you are handicapping [and] undermining our ability to get to the ambitious goals we must have." Booker also supports a fee or tax on carbon pollution that would be used in part to fund clean energy and efficiency investments. (South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is also in favor of price on carbon, and explained his plan to Climate Desk this week.) "I don't think there's any pathway to get to where we need to go without putting some kind of price on carbon," he said. "A lot of people say, 'well gas is so cheap right now.' Yeah, it's cheap because [the price] does not include the full cost to humanity." Booker's support for nuclear power and a carbon fee has tempered any praise from the Climate Justice Alliance, a network that fears these policies would hurt more than help affected communities. Indeed, critics of a carbon tax worry that it would be regressive, hurting the poor more than the rich. But Booker argues that rebates and investments in poor communities could help solve that problem. And while historically, nuclear power companies have built their plants—and dumped the waste—in poor communities of color, Booker believes it doesn't have to be that way: He points to agreements struck between local and national governments in Canada and Europe as a model for a "community process to deal with the waste." Nuclear has proven to be one of the safest ways to advance carbon neutrality," he said. "Even if it means that we have to phase off it in the future, the real pressing challenge right now the threat to our health and our safety and our well-being is climate change and that needs to be our driving focus."

In the Pope's written message to the meeting, conveyed by the Vatican's Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the pontiff expressed his concern for water conservation around the world, as well as his fervent desire that "the threat posed by climate change to our brothers and sisters in the most vulnerable countries will find prompt and effective responses." In another speech at the summit Monday, Mr. Karmenu Vella, European Commissioner for Environment, Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, echoed the Pope's concerns regarding climate change, tying it into the situation of the world's rivers." e are here today because our climate is under threat," Mr. Vella said. "Seasonal river flows are changing, and floods and droughts are more severe, more frequent than ever before." Climate change is raising the temperature of rivers and lakes, with major impacts on ecosystems and water quality. These problems are just as real in Europe as they are elsewhere around the globe," he asserted. The European Commissioner insisted that the key to addressing the problem of climate change and avoiding a "point of no return" is to be found in "political will." The Paris Agreement reminds us of the need to prepare and adapt, and to build up our climate resilience," he said. In a major report last week, the prestigious UK journal, The Lancet, suggested that pollution of air and water, rather than carbon-induced global warming, is the real crisis facing the world, one being overlooked by environmental activists. The Lancet revealed that pollution-related diseases were responsible for an estimated 9 million premature deaths in 2015, or some 15 times more than from all wars and other forms of violence combined. Pollution is not only the largest environmental cause of disease and premature death in the world today, the study found, but diseases caused by pollution were responsible for roughly 16 percent of all deaths worldwide—"three times more deaths than from AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined and 15 times more than from all wars and other forms of violence." Curiously, neither the European Commissioner nor the Pope made any mention to the extraordinary number of deaths caused by water and air pollution, preferring instead to focus on the nebulous and ideologically charged notion of anthropogenic climate change. While to date there has not been a single documented case of a person being killed by carbon dioxide related "global warming," real pollution of air, water and land is killing an average of 25,000 people every day across the globe. Late last week, a report out of Canada suggested that many nations around the world have quietly begun ignoring or abandoning the energy goals outlined by the Paris Climate Accord. According to Lawrence Solomon of Energy Probe, a Toronto-based environmental organization, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is one of the only signers of the Paris agreement who is actually abiding by the exacting demands of the accord. Solomon proposed that while feigning interest in global warming is politically expedient, most people are unconvinced that it poses a real problem—unlike the real pollution that is killing millions. In an essay in Friday's Financial Post, Solomon said that "most signatories are ignoring, if not altogether abandoning Paris commitments, undoubtedly because voters in large part put no stock in scary global warming scenarios." Trudeau now stands almost alone in sincere support of Paris," Solomon wrote. "The populist backlash — a revulsion at top-down governments laden with jet-setting politicians landing in posh places to preach restraint to the masses — has swept America with Trump's election, Great Britain with Brexit, much of Europe, and Australia."

President Trump Says He's Too Intelligent To Believe In Climate Change President Donald Trump asserted that he had "very high levels of intelligence," and as such, did not believe in the scientific consensus surrounding climate change in a sweeping interview with The Washington Post published Tuesday." ne of the problems that a lot of people like myself, we have very high levels of intelligence but we're not necessarily such believers," said Trump, speaking to the Post's Josh Dawsey and Philip Rucker. "You look at our air and our water and it's right now at a record clean. ... As to whether or not it's man-made and whether or not the effects that you're talking about are there, I don't see it — not nearly like it is." Trump's statements, his latest in a long history of climate change denial, go against the vast majority of scientists who say the planet has rapidly warmed since the Industrial Revolution and will continue to do so unless humanity is able to dramatically scale back greenhouse gas emissions. Without such action, the planet faces a slew of devastating effects, including a mass die-off of coral reefs; an increase in the severity of natural disasters, such as wildfires; and a global economic hit in the trillions of dollars, according to a recent United Nations study. The White House released its own sweeping National Climate Assessment on the Friday after Thanksgiving. The 1,656-page report, compiled by 13 federal agencies and more than 300 researchers, painted the bleakest portrait of the future United States yet, noting that the country had already warmed 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit over the past century and will warm a further 3 degrees by 2100 unless fossil fuel use is scaled back. Predictions even said that warming could approach 9 degrees or more by the end of the century. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Tuesday that the recent National Climate Assessment was "not based on facts." The report was compiled by 13 federal agencies and more than 300 researchers. Among threats to health and the environment, the report also warned that sweeping damage would cut off as much as 10 percent of the U.S. economy." t's not based on facts. ... It's not data-driven," White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a news briefing Tuesday. "We'd like to see something that is more data-driven. It's based on modeling." I wrote the climate scenarios chapter myself, so I can confirm it considers ALL scenarios, from those where we go carbon negative before end of century to those where carbon emissions continue to rise," Katharine Hayhoe, a co-author of the current assessment and director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University, said in a tweet on Friday. The president has stayed firm on his anti-climate rhetoric in recent days, even after the devastating Camp fire in Northern California left at least 88 people dead. Trump toured the town of Paradise, which was incinerated, and said that his opinion of climate change hadn't shifted after the visit.

"We are proud to lead the way in the fight against climate change by acting boldly to move our energy system away from fossil fuels and towards sustainable energy sources." Climate change is already a central plank of Sanders' second White House bid. In December, two months before he announced his candidacy, the senator from Vermont hosted a televised town hall with climate scientists and advocates to discuss the crisis. In February, he attacked Trump for ignoring climate change in his State of the Union address. During his stump speeches, Sanders routinely skewers the fossil fuel industry and promises to enact a Green New Deal if elected. The announcement boosts Sanders' bona fides on the issue and gives him a leg up in a crowded field of Democrats putting more attention on climate change than ever before. The move comes a week after the Sanders campaign became the first to unionize. Sanders has also drawn heat recently for his uncertain stance on reparations for the descendants of slaves and for quietly hiring a journalist who frequently attacked his 2020 opponents on Twitter as an adviser. Carbon offsets represent a drop in the bucket on an issue that requires unprecedented systemic change to avert climate disaster. But transportation emissions make up the largest share of the United States' climate pollution. Sanders' announcement steels the campaign against accusations of hypocrisy, often made by Republicans who take an ideological stance against the scientific realities of climate change. The Sanders campaign is buying carbon offsets from Vermont-based NativeEnergy, the same company Clinton used three years ago. Once dubbed the "celebrities' choice in offset providers," NativeEnergy provides third-party verification of how its offsets are used and boasts a high score as a benefit corporation ― a sort of LEED certification of for-profit companies that pay employees decent wages and provide measurable value to society. Though founded and run by a former utility lawyer, the company, as its name suggests, transferred a majority stake in its ownership to a consortium of Native American tribes in 2005. Carbon emissions from campaign travel first became an issue during the 2004 election, when the NRDC Action Fund, an affiliate of the Natural Resources Defense Council, began raising concerns about the huge amount of fuel candidates burned crisscrossing the country. In 2007, former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack became the first presidential contender to go carbon neutral. John Edwards followed soon after. By 2008, both Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain "rushed to put themselves on a carbon diet," according to MSNBC. During the 2016 Democratic primary, Sanders clashed with Clinton over climate change, attacking her support for increased gas drilling in a heated debate. After Clinton clinched the nomination, the issue disappeared, without a single question asked during three debates between Clinton and her Republican opponent, Donald Trump. We are proud to lead the way in the fight against climate change by acting boldly to move our energy system away from fossil fuels and towards sustainable energy sources. Nearly every major declared contender for the Democratic nomination has expressed support for the Green New Deal, a movement calling for a sweeping national industrial policy that zeroes out greenhouse gases over a decade, guarantees clean-energy jobs to millions and puts the country on course to generate as close to 100 percent of its electricity from renewables as possible in a decade. In a first, Washington Gov. Jay Inslee is centering his entire campaign on climate change, vowing to make it his priority if nominated. He joined Sanders, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) in signing the No Fossil Fuel Money pledge, an oath promising to reject donations from the oil, gas and coal companies and their executives. The newfound attention on climate change comes after the United Nations' stark warning in October that world governments have roughly a decade to halve global emissions or face an average temperature increase of at least 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ― about half-a-degree Celisus more than what the world experiences today. Warming beyond that level is forecast to cause catastrophic flooding, droughts and extreme weather, with economic damages topping $54 trillion.	True
500	npr	left_center_bias	2018-10-25	Both trends increase the chances that from time to time, farmers will face catastrophic shortages of water.	They're predicting that a warming climate will bring several changes, most of them bad for growing corn.	No bloom, no harvest.	5 Major Crops In The Crosshairs Of Climate Change 5 Major Crops In The Crosshairs Of Climate ChangeClimate change is coming like a freight train, or a rising tide.	Climate models, though, see a different future.		5 Major Crops In The Crosshairs Of Climate Change 5 Major Crops In The Crosshairs Of Climate ChangeClimate change is coming like a freight train, or a rising tide. And our food, so dependent on rain and suitable temperatures, sits right in its path. The plants that nourish us won't disappear entirely. But they may have to move to higher and cooler latitudes, or farther up a mountainside. Some places may find it harder to grow anything at all, because there's not enough water. Here are five foods, and food-growing places, that will see the impact. Wheat, source of bread and a foundation of life in much of the world, will suffer from hotter temperatures — and the country where the impact may be greatest also is among least well-equipped to cope with a shortfall. India is likely to see a large drop in wheat production due to heat stress — about 8 percent if average global temperatures rise by 1 degree Celsius, according to one recent study. Temperatures are expected to rise more than that; according to a recent report from the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, limiting climate change to 1.5 degrees Celsius will require heroic and dramatic action. It will take significant cuts in greenhouse gas emissions within 15 years, plus efforts to recapture some of the carbon that's already been emitted, perhaps by planting new forests. Globally, though, wheat may not be in short supply in a warmer world. Russia, which is already a major wheat exporter, may be able to expand the amount of land devoted to this crop. Despite Georgia's claim to be the Peach State, California is the country's biggest peach producer. Farmers there grow about half of the country's fresh peaches, and almost all of the fruit that's canned and processed in other ways. Many fruit trees, including peaches, have a peculiar requirement. If they don't experience enough chill during wintertime, they get confused and don't bloom properly. No bloom, no harvest. The peach trees currently grown in California's Central Valley require about 700 "chilling hours" during the winter. But scientists are predicting that by the end of the century, only 10 percent of the valley will reliably see that much chilling. And even if plant breeders create peach varieties that need less chilling, there's another problem: Peach trees also yield less fruit when it gets too hot in summertime. Coffee can't take freezing temperatures, but it doesn't like extreme heat, either — at least the highly prized Arabica type doesn't. So it's mainly grown on relatively cool mountainsides in the tropics. Brazil is the biggest coffee producer in the world, by far, but as the globe warms up, most of its main coffee-growing regions probably won't be suitable for growing this crop anymore, due to heat as well as more frequent rainstorms. Coffee could move to cooler parts of the country, but researchers don't think those new growing areas will make up for what's lost. Meanwhile, rising temperatures could threaten native coffee trees that grow wild in the forests of Ethiopia and central Africa. The wild trees represent an irreplaceable storehouse of coffee's original genetic diversity. The world's commercial coffee trees are genetically very similar to each other, and those genetically diverse wild trees could be the source of genetic traits that plant breeders may need in order to create commercial trees that can thrive in tomorrow's climate. Some of the wild trees, however, are preserved in "gene banks" in Ethiopia and Latin America. Nothing says Iowa quite like fields of corn. Climate models, though, see a different future. They're predicting that a warming climate will bring several changes, most of them bad for growing corn. Rain will come less often, and when it comes, the storms will be more intense — neither of which is helpful for a crop that demands frequent rains, but doesn't do a good job of preventing soil erosion. In addition, corn suffers when it gets too hot — especially when it's too hot at night. Add it all up, and one study estimates that corn yields in Iowa will fall substantially, anywhere from 15 percent to an astounding 50 percent. "By 2100, the Corn Belt is going to be in Canada, not in the United States," says Jason Clay, senior vice president for food and markets at the World Wildlife Fund. So what will replace corn on Iowa's fertile land? According to one study, by the end of the century this part of the Midwest will be more suited for growing cotton, soybeans, grass and forests. California, the biggest single source of America's fresh vegetables and nuts, and the primary source of almonds for the entire world, is a dramatic illustration of how subtle shifts in climate can have huge effects. California's farms rely heavily on snow that piles up in the Sierra Nevada mountains during the winter, and then slowly melts during the summer, delivering a vital flow of water to the state's irrigation canals. As the climate warms, though, winter precipitation will arrive more often as rain, and the snow that does fall will melt much more quickly, leaving farmers scrambling for water to keep crops alive in late summer. Also, there will be more variation from year to year; wet years will be wetter, and dry years will be even dryer. Both trends increase the chances that from time to time, farmers will face catastrophic shortages of water. And that's especially bad for tree crops, of which almonds are the biggest, because losing an orchard is much more devastating than losing a single crop of, say, tomatoes. California's farmers may be forced to reduce the amount of land devoted to orchards, since there there's a chance that they will not survive a major drought.	False
358	thedailycaller	right_bias	2018-09-11	Brown is right in one sense.	University of Colorado professor Roger Pielke, Jr. recently published a paper on the problems with the UN's use of BECCS to sell the Paris climate accord."	et BECCS plays a very real role in today's climate policy arena," Pielke wrote, "by helping to maintain the climate policy envelope and save us from having to do the enormously difficult and uncomfortable work of thinking how we might go about addressing accumulating carbon dioxide in the atmosphere differently than we have since the 1980s and '90s."	So what does negative emissions mean in practice?	Brown's executive order came the same day he signed into law a bill mandating California get 100 percent of its electricity from renewables and "zero-carbon" energy sources.		Jerry Brown's Plan For 'Negative' CO2 Emissions Is Based On 'Science Fiction' California Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown issued an executive order Monday mandating "carbon neutrality" by 2045, then ordering the state to "maintain net negative emissions thereafter." Brown's executive order came the same day he signed into law a bill mandating California get 100 percent of its electricity from renewables and "zero-carbon" energy sources. Brown is also preparing to host a global warming activist summit Wednesday." alifornia is committed to doing whatever is necessary to meet the existential threat of climate change," Brown said Monday. "But have no illusions, California and the rest of the world have miles to go before we achieve zero-carbon emissions." Brown is right in one sense. California does have "miles to go" to meet Brown's executive order because it relies on "magical thinking" and "science fiction," according to experts. Existing executive orders call for California to cut greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, and state law requires emissions to be cut 40 percent by 2030. However, that's not enough to meet the goals of the Paris climate accord, according to United Nations models. What Brown ordered is not just reducing emissions, but instead implied sucking more greenhouse gas out of the air than human activities in his state put up — and not just for electricity. Brown's order applies to the entire economy, including transportation and agriculture. So what does negative emissions mean in practice? Well, no one really knows, but experts have put forward ideas to suck carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Brown's office said negative emissions would be achieved through "increased carbon sequestration in forests, soils and other natural landscapes," according to its press release. But how would this even work? (RELATED: A New Report Details How Nonprofits Are Funneling Millions To Democratic Governors To Further Their Global Warming Agenda)Scientists have also proposed technologies to literally suck carbon dioxide from the air and store it underground or in the ocean. Experts have also suggested reforestation, ocean fertilization and what's known as enhanced weathering. Enhanced weathering is the rather hilarious idea that one can use rocks to, in effect, store CO2 emissions. In theory, the rocks would react with CO2 and water to form an alkaline solution that leaks into the ocean. However, all of these proposals remains "magical thinking" at this point, according to an editorial in the journal Nature. Enhanced weathering, for example, would require "an area about the size of Texas … of US agricultural land every year" just to "soak up 13% of the annual global emissions from agriculture," according to Nature. Another proposed technology that's cited by the IPCC is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). This is basically removing CO2 through growing plants, which are then burned for energy. The emissions are then captured and stored underground. Of course, BECCS is another magical solution that's baked into the IPCC's models of what needs to be done to limit future global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. University of Colorado professor Roger Pielke, Jr. recently published a paper on the problems with the UN's use of BECCS to sell the Paris climate accord." arbon dioxide removal at massive scale is science fiction — like a light saber, incredible but not real," Pielke wrote." et BECCS plays a very real role in today's climate policy arena," Pielke wrote, "by helping to maintain the climate policy envelope and save us from having to do the enormously difficult and uncomfortable work of thinking how we might go about addressing accumulating carbon dioxide in the atmosphere differently than we have since the 1980s and '90s." If nothing else, full implementation of BECCS 'at scale' would require the use of a global land area one and a half times the size of India," Pielke wrote about the staggering environmental cost of "negative emissions" technology. Indeed, the European Academies Science Advisory Council concluded in early 2018 that negative emissions technologies "offer only limited realistic potential to remove carbon from the atmosphere and not at the scale envisaged in some climate scenarios."

It was a different story this time around. It took more than an hour to get there Tuesday night, but during the 12 minutes of discussion of global warming policy, two of the frontrunners—Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders—became the first candidates to substantively embrace versions of a Green New Deal in the debates. The concept of a Green New Deal—pushed by lawmakers like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.)—has become a favorite idea for progressives. It outlines a vision for economic, infrastructure, and clean energy investment while aggressively ramping down to net-zero emissions as soon as possible. Elizabeth Warren didn't actually use the words "Green Neal Deal" or tout AOC's specific resolution Tuesday night, but she did capture its ethos by touting her plan for investing $2 trillion over 10 years in green manufacturing. "The climate crisis is the existential crisis for our world," she said. "I have a plan for a green industrial policy that takes advantage of the fact that we do what we do best, and that is innovate and create." She promised that her plan would produce roughly 1.2 million manufacturing jobs. "This could revitalize huge cities across this country," she added. Bernie Sanders also embraced the Green New Deal on stage, albeit briefly. "The Green New Deal is a bold idea," he said. "We can create millions of good paying jobs. We can rebuild communities in rural America that have been devastated." As he often does, Sanders pledged to fight back against the fossil fuel industry, noting that it continues to receive tax breaks and subsidies adding up to hundreds of billions of dollars globally. "I get a little bit tired of Democrats afraid of big ideas. Republicans are not afraid of big ideas," he said.  "Please don't tell me that we cannot take on the fossil fuel industry." Other candidates on stage were far more critical of Green New Deal policies. Former Maryland Rep. John Delaney pointed to his plan for a carbon price and investing in technology to capture carbon from the air. But, he argued, a Green New Deal would tie progress on climate to "other things that are completely unrelated to climate like universal health care and guaranteed jobs." Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper—who has advocated working collaboratively with the oil and gas industry to address climate change—called Green New Deal proposals "a disaster at the ballot box." You might as well FedEx the election to Donald Trump," Hickenlooper said. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock expressed doubt that such an ambitious program could make it through Congress. "Let's not just talk about plans that are written for press releases that will go nowhere else if we can't even get a Republican to acknowledge that the climate is changing," he said. Nearly every Democratic presidential candidate has now released a climate change plan, or at least part of a plan. Climate change has consistently ranked as one of the top concerns among Democratic primary voters—and polls suggest that Trump's climate denial is deeply unpopular. The relatively brief segment devoted to climate change Tuesday is unlikely to satisfy environmental activists. They have pressed for an official DNC climate change debate because, they argue, it's needed to finally allot candidates the time to debate their plans in depth—and to highlight the fact that President Donald Trump has no answers himself." rankly, I don't think we see an indicator that candidates aren't willing to talk about solutions," Greenpeace's US climate campaigns director Janet Redman told me after the last debate in June.

Now America stands alone – nearly 200 countries have joined this global commitment to fighting climate change, even global pariahs like North Korea and civil war-torn countries like Syria." <sep> 	Trump begins year-long process to formally exit Paris climate agreement Donald Trump is moving to formally exit the Paris climate agreement, making the United States the only country in the world that will not participate in the pact, as global temperatures are set to rise 3C and worsening extreme weather will drive millions into poverty. The paperwork sent by the US government to withdraw begins a one-year process for exiting the deal agreed to at the UN climate change conference in Paris in 2015. The Trump administration will not be able to finalize its exit until a day after the presidential election in November 2020. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, announced the development on Monday afternoon, saying the agreement would be an "unfair economic burden imposed on American workers, businesses and taxpayers" and that the US has already reduced its heat-trapping emissions. But organizers of local city and state efforts to curb the crisis across America say the US is still trying to play a role in fighting the climate crisis, despite the actions of the federal government. Carl Pope, vice chair of the group America's Pledge, said its members – who are vowing to keep fighting the climate emergency – produce more than half the country's heat-trapping emissions and represent about 70% of the US gross domestic product. Another organization, the US Climate Alliance, includes the governors of 25 states, representing 55% of the US population. In the Paris agreement, the US agreed to cut its heat-trapping pollution at least 26% below 2005 levels by 2025. Dozens of countries are also pursuing goals to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. But they represent only about 11% of the world's climate footprint and exclude the biggest emitters: China, the US and India. Staying on par with those more advanced countries would require the US government to eliminate pollution from coal and natural gas powered electricity plants, transportation, manufacturing facilities and agriculture. Local action by itself is not likely to be enough." e don't think it's likely just with the states we have, we think we need the whole country to be moving together," Pope said. Jean Su, energy director with the Center for Biological Diversity's Climate Law Institute, said: "America is the number one historical contributor to the climate emergency wreaking havoc in burning California, the flooded Southeast and the rest of the world." The next president must repay this extraordinary climate debt by rapidly moving America to 100% clean energy and financing the decarbonization of the Global South," Su said, referring to the developing world. In addition, the Trump administration has also pulled US funding commitments to help the developing world cut pollution. John Kerry and Chuck Hagel, president Barack Obama's secretaries of state and defense respectively, in a Washington Post op-ed, called it a "dark day for America"." limate change is already affecting every sector and region of the United States, as hundreds of top scientists from 13 federal agencies made clear in a report the White House itself released last year," they said. "The past five years were the warmest ever recorded. Without steep pollution reductions, climate change will risk tens of thousands of US lives every year by the end of the century." They called the Paris agreement, "a start, not a finish line," but "the best ignition switch the world could agree on to spark international cooperation on this critical issue". Senator Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the Senate environment panel, said: "Once again, President Trump is abandoning our global allies for the sake of misplaced political gain. Now America stands alone – nearly 200 countries have joined this global commitment to fighting climate change, even global pariahs like North Korea and civil war-torn countries like Syria." Carper said Trump is abandoning "tremendous economic opportunity" and public health benefits. Trumphas alternately ignored or denied the climate crisis. His agencies are nixing regulations for power plants and cars, and bolstering fossil fuels whenever possible. He promised, to widespread dismay, to exit the Paris agreement during his campaign. The Democratic 2020 election frontrunners challenging Trump have all said they would set the country on a path to neutralize its climate pollution by 2050. Nate Hultman, director of the University of Maryland's center for global sustainability and lead author of this year's America's Pledge report, pointed to new laws in New Mexico, Nevada, Washington, Maine, New York, Washington DC, and Puerto Rico for 100% clean energy targets. Hawaii and California already had such laws. Together, they represent 16% of the nation's electricity, more than doubling the share from 2018, he said." nother way to think about it is that Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris agreement is supported in reality by only about 30% of the economy and 35% of the population," Hultman said. Even once the US withdraws, the country can participate as an observer in international climate negotiations. But despite the efforts of subnational governments, recent analysis shows the US is still far off track from its commitments, regardless of whether Trump pulled out. The US is also far from neutralizing climate emissions by the middle of the century, which as many experts say will be necessary for all countries in order to avert the worst of the crisis." e can still get there with a serious shift in policy in the coming years," said Kate Larsen, director of Rhodium's international energy and climate research.

It's well over 1,000 pages and touches on a daunting range of topics. President Trump said Monday that he has read parts of it. "It's fine," he told reporters at the White House, although he said he doesn't believe the report's assessment that climate change will cause devastating economic impacts for the U.S. The report is required by Congress every four years and is issued by 13 federal agencies and the U.S. Global Change Research Program. This one marks the most detailed and blunt assessment yet of the dangers of unchecked global warming." Climate change is happening here and now," co-author Katherine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University told Weekend Edition Saturday. "It is affecting all of us no matter where we live. And the more climate changes, the more serious and even more dangerous the impacts will become." Here are some key points. Some parts of the U.S. economy could suffer hundreds of billions of dollars in annual losses by the end of the century unless global greenhouse gas emissions are substantially reduced, the report finds. Already, there's the impact of increasingly frequent and intense extreme weather events. The report notes that large wildfires are more frequent and that the areas burned by lightning-ignited fires are "expected to increase by at least 30 percent by 2060." The costs for fighting fires and forest management are on the rise (see chart). But there are other, less obvious risks. Don't see the graphic above? Click hereIncreasing rain and humidity could cause agricultural productivity to fall in the Midwest, and warming oceans will hurt fisheries. Along the coasts, more severe flooding threatens billions of dollars' worth of property and infrastructure, which in turn "could affect the economic stability of local governments, businesses, and the broader economy." Extreme weather events could also cause price spikes and interrupt international trade. As an example, the report notes that flooding in Thailand in 2011 disrupted production of Ford and Honda vehicles in the U.S. and cost a U.S.-based hard drive manufacturer $199 million in losses. Again, the rise of extreme events like wildfires, floods and storm surges poses the most immediate danger to public health and well-being. The report finds that with continued warming, heat-related deaths will increase. The warming climate and more frequent and intense rain might also expand the range of ticks and mosquitoes, exposing more people to diseases like West Nile, dengue fever, chikungunya and Lyme. Climate change could also worsen harmful ozone levels and air pollution. That could send more people to the hospital for aggravated asthma and respiratory or cardiovascular problems and could even increase premature deaths. As with so many climate impacts, the report notes that those most at risk include children, the elderly and low-income communities.U.S. infrastructure was not built for these changesMuch of America's infrastructure is already aging and deteriorating, and it is taking a pounding from extreme weather. In some places, more intense rain and saltwater intrusion have led to dam failures, bridge and road closures and power outages. Heavier downpours can also overwhelm sewer systems, causing untreated water to flow into rivers. In the West, prolonged drought has forced utilities to cut back on electricity production from hydropower. Extreme heat (and higher demand) can also raise the risk of power outages. The report notes that power outages can affect drinking water treatment, among many other services people take for granted. Intense rain, flooding and heat can also hurt the nation's vast network of transportation, shutting down major highways and coastal airports and halting freight movement. The report, like most climate studies, offers different scenarios for how fast the climate will change and by how much. The bigger the change, the greater the consequences for everything from heat waves to hurricanes. The White House issued a statement criticizing the report as largely based on the "most extreme scenario" for emissions of greenhouse gases. The report is in fact based mostly on two scenarios: One is the most severe view, in which little or no effort is made to lower emissions. However, it also uses a more moderate scenario, one that sees more aggressive actions to reduce emissions than are currently underway — less fossil fuel use, for example, or more efficient vehicles and buildings. And for some of its chapters, the report considers a third, far rosier future where emissions are drastically reduced and even where greenhouse gases are pulled back out of the atmosphere. Effects on people and the economy are considerably less dire under these scenarios than in the most severe one. Some communities are already adaptingThe good news in this dire report is that scores of local and state governments are taking action to lower their own carbon emissions and cope with climate impacts. Some of those impacts will get worse still, no matter what, as they are "locked in due to historical emissions." But the report makes clear that changes today can make a big difference." It's absolutely not too late to take action," says Brenda Ekwurzel, a co-author and senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The report states that more than half the projected damages of coastal property "are estimated to be avoidable through well-timed adaptation measures." But Ekwurzel cautions that we can't merely adapt our way out of this mess." The cost of adaptation could be quite high, and it may never be enough," she says. "But costs will really start skyrocketing if we don't start reining in emissions."	True

Temperatures to rise 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2030-2052 without rapid steps: U.N. report LONDON/SEOUL (Reuters) – Temperatures are likely to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052 if global warming continues at its current pace and if the world fails to take rapid and unprecedented measures to stem the increase, a U.N. report said on Monday. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) met last week in Incheon, South Korea to finalize the report, prepared at the request of governments in 2015 when a global pact to tackle climate change was agreed. The report is seen as the main scientific guide for government policymakers on how to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement. The Paris pact aims to limit global average temperature rise to "well below" 2C above pre-industrial levels, while seeking to tighten the goal to 1.5C. There has already been a rise of 1C since the mid-1800s as industrialization lifted emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main greenhouse gas blamed for climate change.A rise of 1.5C would still carry climate-related risks for nature and mankind but the risks would be lower than a rise of 2C, the report summary said. Meeting the 1.5C limit required "rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented" change in land and energy use, industry, buildings, transport and cities, it said, adding temperatures would be 1.5C higher between 2030 and 2052 at the current pace. The targets agreed in Paris on cutting emissions would not be enough even if there were larger and more ambitious cuts after 2030, it said. To contain warming at 1.5C, manmade global net carbon dioxide emissions would need to fall by about 45 percent by 2030 from 2010 levels and reach "net zero" by mid-century. Any additional emissions would require removing CO2 from the air." imiting warming to 1.5C is possible within the laws of chemistry and physics but doing so would require unprecedented changes," said Jim Skea, co-chair of the IPCC working group which assesses climate change mitigation. The summary said renewable energy would need to supply 70 to 85 percent of electricity by 2050 to stay within a 1.5C limit, compared with about 25 percent now. Using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, the share of gas-fired power would need to be cut to 8 percent and coal to between 0 and 2 percent. There was no mention of oil in this context in the summary. If the average global temperature temporarily exceeded 1.5C, additional carbon removal techniques would be required to return warming to below 1.5C by 2100. But the report said the efficacy of measures, such as planting forests, bioenergy use or capturing and storing CO2, were unproven at a large scale and carried some risks. Steps like reflecting incoming solar radiation back into space were not assessed because of the uncertainties about using such technology, the report said. It said keeping the rise in temperature to 1.5C would mean sea levels by 2100 would be 10 cm lower than if the warming was 2C, the likelihood of an Arctic Ocean free of sea ice in summer would be once per century not at least once a decade, and coral reefs would decline by 70-90 percent instead of being virtually wiped out." he report shows that we only have the slimmest of opportunities remaining to avoid unthinkable damage to the climate system that supports life as we know it," said Amjad Abdulla, the IPCC board member and chief negotiator for the alliance of small island states.

Conservation Isn't the Solution to California's Water Problems In January, California's Jerry Brown became the first governor in the state's history to declare a state of emergency for a drought and a flood simultaneously.		Conservation Isn't the Solution to California's Water Problems In January, California's Jerry Brown became the first governor in the state's history to declare a state of emergency for a drought and a flood simultaneously. On Friday, Brown lifted the drought emergency in all but four counties (Fresno, Kings, Tulare, and Tuolumne counties). But, rather than lift the burdensome water regulations implemented to cope with the drought, he announced that many of those regulations would remain intact, even though the flood emergency remains. Brown's latest plan, "Making Water Conservation a California Way of Life," allows the state to oversee conservation goals it sets in urban water-management agencies, as well as to permanently prohibit activities it deems wasteful of the water supply. It also creates more stringent standards for establishing these water-use goals. Brown has indicated that he hopes to expand the state's water supply with new sources of water, but his focus on making conservation "a way of life" — in a time when California's streets are flooding — suggests otherwise. Certainly, Californians — and everyone else — ought to find ways to responsibly use natural resources such as water. Mandating conservation, however, is drastically different from incentivizing it. Even though there is no longer a drought state of emergency in their state, Californians will be fined if they wash their automobiles with hoses "not equipped with a shut-off nozzle," water lawns in a way that results in water run-off, or hose off sidewalks. The plan also gives urban government agencies until 2025 to comply with their conservation targets, limiting the water usage of Californians. But water conservation can only go so far. California ought to begin expanding its water supply rather than incessantly regulate how citizens use water, especially now that the governor doesn't retain the broad powers spelled out under the drought state of emergency (Brown's flood state of emergency doesn't give him the same power to regulate water use). John Woodling of the Sacramento Regional Water Authority told the Sacramento Bee that Brown's assertion of state power in this area will give it "permanent, unchecked control over local water management decisions." And, as Brown's plan begins to drive water consumption down, Woodling said, it could hurt the economy. Governor Brown has pushed two contradictory agendas for months. Now, even he has concluded that California is no longer in a drought. It's time for these conservation regulations to be lifted and for the state to do what it should have done a long time ago: look to expand its water supply.	True

Trump's top economic adviser: 'The Green New Deal will literally destroy the economy' Speaking at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow slammed the progressive proposal that was recently introduced by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts. Kudlow said the deal "will knock out energy, transportation, airlines, jobs, businesses. We'll probably lose 10 to 15% of our GDP. It's remarkable." The package of legislation is aimed at, among other things, addressing climate change. It would phase out fossil fuel use, and calls for the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions and pollution in agriculture, transportation, manufacturing and construction. The deal describes a 10-year "economic mobilization" that would overhaul the nation's infrastructure and build new layers into the existing social safety net. It calls for the creation of millions of new high-wage jobs to help wipe out poverty.

Kudlow said universal health care and ending private insurance were also "crazy ideas," citing high costs. He said, "guaranteed jobs, free to those who don't want to work, probably cost $45 trillion." Earlier this week Ivanka Trump, a senior White House adviser and the President's daughter, was asked about the Green New Deal proposal and what she would say to people who are enticed by the proposal's job guarantee.

On September 16, 2016, the Obama EPA entered into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP). Concluded just a few weeks before the 2016 presidential election, the MOU bears the signature for the U.S. of then-EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. In the document, UNEP and the Obama EPA vow to "consolidate, further develop and intensify their cooperation and effectiveness to achieve their common goals and objectives in the field of the environment." And therein lies the problem.

Thus, UNEP and the Obama EPA agreed to "cooperate on responses to climate change," including mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, reducing short-lived climate forcers and supporting adaptation and resilience to climate change. Taking these and similar steps, the MOU says, will enable the advance "toward green economies and resource-efficient societies through collaborative activities to promote and support sustainable consumption and production." In truth, "green economies" are those with taxpayer-subsidized and government-mandated renewable energy (primarily wind and solar). And what constitutes "sustainable consumption and production" is in the eyes of the beholding bureaucrat, empowered either by the administrative regulatory state or by legislation adopted at the behest of deep-pocketed special interests. All of this is to be pursued through jointly held symposia, seminars, workshops, study tours, collaborative research and development projects, exchanges and training programs and other forms of cooperation that strengthen the bonds between UNEP and the U.S. Under the MOU, each side is to name a "Senior Coordinator" to oversee the holding of "regular joint meetings on matters of common interest." To make sure the two sides stay in touch, "such meetings are to take place at least once every six months in accordance with an agenda approved by them in advance of every meeting." The outfit the Obama administration teamed up within the MOU, UNEP, was founded in 1972 by wealthy Canadian businessman Maurice Strong; it is headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya and has an office conveniently located in Washington, D.C. Strong (1929–2015) was Under-Secretary-General of the U.N. when he founded UNEP and was an early advocate for combatting what he said was human-induced climate change, then known as global warming. In keeping with Strong's vision, UNEP has worked closely with the Bonn-based United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). For its part, UNFCCC has enthusiastically spread climate alarmism and gone to extraordinary lengths to deny the residents of the world's poorest access to reliable and affordable electricity and transportation fuel, thereby perpetuating their poverty. Given UNEP's pedigree and the Obama administration's unbridled hostility to fossil fuels, President Trump should scrap the UNEP-EPA MOU. Trump and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt inherited the MOU from their predecessors and are under no obligation to adhere to its content. The White House has already withdrawn from the Paris climate accord, and President Trump chose to skip the climate-change session at the recent G7 meeting in Quebec. Continued fealty to the Obama-era MOU runs counter to the president's goal of American global energy dominance, which is anchored to our abundance of oil, natural gas, and coal. The ties that bound the UN and the Obama administration should not be allowed to constrain the choices of everyday Americans. Even if the MOU is "non-binding," so, too, are the commitments all parties agreed to under the Paris climate accord.  But recognizing the threat the Paris accord posed to U.S. energy security, the Trump White House wisely walked away from it. The UNEP-EPA memorandum is little more than an implementation tool of the Paris agreement and should suffer the same fate. Both are part of what is, at its core, a decidedly anti-American agenda.

The former Montana congressman blamed "litigation from radical environmentalists who would rather see forests and communities burn than see a logger in the woods," in a USA Today op-ed published Wednesday. Zinke also called out "extreme environmentalists" in an interview with KCRA that aired Sunday. The day before that, Zinke lambasted "environmental terrorists groups that have not allowed public access, that refuse to allow harvest of timber" in an interview with Breitbart Radio. Deadly wildfires have consumed over 1 million acres in West Coast states, damaging structures and forcing thousands to flee their homes. The recent death of a firefighter battling the nearly 350,000-acre Mendocino Complex Fire brings the death toll to six for this season. So what's the point of attacking environmentalists? Zinke is taking the conversation away from global warming and bringing it back to land management, including the litigation and environmental laws that keep officials from actively managing the forests. Instead, activists focus on global warming, arguing human-caused warming has expanded wildfire season due to longer hotter, drier conditions in the western states. At the same time, these groups often oppose efforts to clear forests of debris and dead wood that fuel fires when hot, dry weather sets in every year." 've heard the climate change argument back and forth," Zinke told the Sacramento-based KCRA. "This has nothing to do with climate change. This has to do with active forest management." (RELATED: California's Biggest Utility Continues To Blame Global Warming For Wildfires Started By Its Own Power Lines)Wildfire experts tend to see land management and urban growth as prime drivers of wildfires. Many experts also see global warming as a factor in the rise of fires, but admit the relationship is more complicated than the media lets on." he story can't be a simply that warming is increasing the numbers of wildfires in California because the number of fires is declining. And area burned has not been increasing either," University of Washington climate scientist Cliff Mass wrote in a recent blog post. In fact, the recent National Climate Assessment special report gave "low to medium confidence for a detectable human climate change contribution in the western United States based on existing studies." Most wildfires are caused by humans, mostly unintentionally. Sparks from vehicles or equipment, power lines, arson and cigarettes are some of the ways humans cause massive blazes. Lightning is the cause of wildfires humans don't spark. In California, for example, humans caused 95 percent of all wildfires, with power lines and utility equipment becoming a growing problem. Research also shows that wildfire season has primarily grown from population growth in fire-prone areas, increasing the chances of a fire-causing spark. Environmentalists have obviously not taken kindly to Zinke's remarks, but are particularly incensed by his dismissal of global warming as a driver of catastrophic wildfires. Randi Spivak, public lands program director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said the administration is missing the main issue by being dismissive of climate change's effect on the fires." limate change creates drought, high wind conditions, low humidity. Fire creates its own weather," Randi Spivak, the public lands director at the Center for Biological Diversity, told The Hill." ou can thin all you want till the cows come home but fire will overtake that," Spivak said, adding "what is misleading is people like Zinke and other people who refuse to talk about climate change and how we need to tackle that." Name calling and finger pointing won't change the truth that climate change is exacerbating wildfires," echoed the Sierra Club's Athan Manuel. "The long-term safety of our communities relies on reducing carbon pollution." Zinke actually did say fire season had gotten longer and temperatures had warmed, but added that "doesn't relieve you of the responsibility to remove the dead and dying timber and manage our forests so you don't have these catastrophic burns." But Zinke is correct that environmental litigation has kept federal agencies, including the Interior Department and U.S. Forest Service, from thinning, clearing debris and conducting prescribed burns to keep forest growth in check.A 2014 study published in the Journal of Forestry found "[v]egetative management, or logging projects continued to be the dominant type of management activity involved in Forest Service land management litigation, representing nearly three times more cases than any other type of management activity." The Forest Service was found more likely to lose cases "where plaintiffs advocated for less resource use," particularly in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals where the agency won less than half its cases. In fact, the 9th Circuit on Monday overturned a Forest Service plan for part of Idaho's Payette National Forest. The judge sided with environmental groups and ruled "renders the Project inconsistent with the desired vegetative conditions set forth in the Payette Forest Plan" from 2003. The service's plan that got overturned included getting "fire conditions toward historical range of variability to reduce wildland fire risk, improve wildlife habitat" through "mechanical thinning, harvest and prescribed burning."

After seeing the recent footage of workers dumping the toxic waste at the site, state Representative Gerry Pollet, who also serves as the executive director of Heart of America Northwest, called their actions "outrageous."	The one thing you don't want to do is create more waste sites," said Dirk Dunning, a chemical engineer and Hanford expert.		Video shows workers at Hanford illegally dumping radioactive water Investigators are looking into the Hanford nuclear facility in Washington state, after contractors were filmed dumping radiation-affected water and later tried to bury the evidence at the site of one of the largest nuclear cleanup efforts in the world. Several videos obtained by Seattle's KING-TV show workers at the Hanford facility's Plutonium Finishing Plant (PFP) dumping liquids from large metal containers that are labeled "Caution: radioactive materials." In nearly 25 years of working here I've never seen anything like that," a Hanford worker told KING. The workers are employed by Washington River Protection Solutions (WRPS), the organization responsible for cleaning approximately 53 million gallons of high-level radioactive and chemical waste stored in the containers at Hanford. The facility dates back to the Manhattan Project in the 1940s. For decades, it produced the majority of the plutonium for the US nuclear weapons arsenal. In 1988, production stopped and the site became a burying ground for radioactive waste. Hanford has since become the most contaminated spot in the Western Hemisphere, prompting a multi-billion dollar clean-up process that isn't expected to be completed until 2060." he soils under Hanford are extensively contaminated over a broad, broad area. The one thing you don't want to do is create more waste sites," said Dirk Dunning, a chemical engineer and Hanford expert. WRPS told state investigators that workers dumped around 15 gallons of potentially toxic water on August 15 and 200 gallons on August 17, according to a document from the Department of Ecology. Washington law makes it a gross misdemeanor to discharge pollutants into the water or soil. The company was also required to report any discharge of toxic waste to the Department of Ecology within 24 hours. However, WRPS did not report the discharges for nearly a month, and a notification from the Department of Ecology shows the company only made the report days after KING emailed WRPS, federal and state officials, and the Environmental Crimes Unit of the state Office of the Attorney General about the incident." hey knew it was wrong (to dump the liquids) but they did it anyway. They were hoping no one would question it. They definitely knew it should have been reported," a WRPS employee said. WRPS had been tasked with digging up 18 underground nuclear waste hoses and putting them in containers, which would then be buried in a nuclear waste dump at the facility. When workers found one of their containers filled with rainwater, they decided to dump it onto the ground rather than testing the water or transferring it to new containers.A contract shows the company would earn $58,333 for each hose that was removed, for a total of more than $1 million dollars, if they finished the project by September 30. WRPS dumped the toxic liquid in order to meet their deadline, said Tom Carpenter, executive director at Hanford Challenge, a watchdog organization working to keep contractors working at the facility accountable." hey are here for the money and that's it," Carpenter told KING. "This fee structure ignores human nature, which is to take shortcuts to get the money without any accountability unless they get caught." The Department of Ecology has launched an investigation and has already been to the site to take soil samples to check for chemicals such as arsenic, lead and fluorene at the first dumping site. However, after WRPS did a radiological survey and identified beta and gamma radioactive contamination, they removed the contaminated soil and surrounding debris, which can no longer be tested by investigators. The disposal of radioactive waste at Hanford has been plagued with problems. RT visited the site last year, after workers were evacuated from the facility due to a leak of thousands of gallons of toxic waste. Locals said that the site occasionally "burps" radiation, which has led to a number of employees developing serious medical conditions over the years. In August, the company tested more than 300 workers, and found 20 percent tested positive for radiation contamination. The Department of Energy estimates that 444 billion gallons of radioactive material and chemical waste were discharged onto the grounds of the facility and into the Columbia River in the first 50 years since the facility opened. Dumping at the site without a permit became illegal after the nonprofit advocacy group Heart of America Northwest sued the Department of Energy in 1993. After seeing the recent footage of workers dumping the toxic waste at the site, state Representative Gerry Pollet, who also serves as the executive director of Heart of America Northwest, called their actions "outrageous." This is the kind of thing that caused Hanford to be the most contaminated place in the Western Hemisphere in the first place. I am shocked to see something like this in 2017," Pollet said." t's a crime. I'm convinced by looking at this that you're witnessing a criminal violation of several statues, not just one."	False

Peter Robbins, an FPL spokesman, said "Mayor Stoddard is wrong.	he whole site is pretty well able to handle dangerous wind, the real problem from my perspective is water," Stoddard said.	He said he was more worried about the nuclear waste than the reactors."	Time will tell whether better proves good enough," said Dave Lochbaum, director of a watchdog group, the nuclear safety project, at the Union of Concerned Scientists.		Hurricane Irma poses toughest test for U.S. nuclear industry since Fukushima (Reuters) – Hurricane Irma will pose the toughest test yet for U.S. nuclear power plants since reactors strengthened their defenses against natural disasters following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident in Japan in 2011. Irma was on course to hit South Florida early on Sunday after slamming Cuba as a Category 5 storm. It weakened to a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 130 miles per hour (210 km per hour) on Saturday, but was expected to strengthen before reaching Florida, bringing a storm surge to a state home to four coastal nuclear reactors. The National Hurricane Center's forecast track shows Irma making landfall on the southwest side of the Florida Peninsula, west of the two nuclear reactors at the Turkey Point plant. The operator, Florida Power & Light (FPL), has said it will shut Turkey Point well before hurricane-strength winds reach the plant. The reactors are about 30 miles (42 kilometers) south of Miami. FPL said it will also shut the other nuclear plant in Florida at St Lucie, which also has two reactors on a barrier island on the state's east coast, about 120 miles (193 km) north of Miami." e will shut the reactors down 24 hours before Category 1 force winds are forecast to hit," FPL Chief Executive Eric Silagy told a news conference. FPL said both Turkey Point and St Lucie were designed to withstand storms stronger than any ever recorded in the region and both plants are elevated 20 feet (6 meters) above sea level to protect against flooding and extreme storm surges. But South Miami Mayor Philip Stoddard said he was concerned about the potential for floods to damage power generators at Turkey Point, which in turn might threaten the ability of the plant to keep spent nuclear fuel rods cool. At Fukushima in Japan, an earthquake and tsunami disrupted power supplies and caused the fuel in some units to meltdown." he whole site is pretty well able to handle dangerous wind, the real problem from my perspective is water," Stoddard said. He said he was more worried about the nuclear waste than the reactors." he real question is can they keep the spent fuel cool." Peter Robbins, an FPL spokesman, said "Mayor Stoddard is wrong. Turkey Point is safe and is ready for Hurricane Irma."U.S. nuclear operators have taken steps to improve preparations for disasters since Fukushima. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) required plants to install portable pumps and generators to keep water moving over fuel rods and the spent fuel pool even if offsite power supply was lost. Nuclear plants also hired more staff and stored equipment needed to deal with reactor problems." hings are better today than in March 2011. Time will tell whether better proves good enough," said Dave Lochbaum, director of a watchdog group, the nuclear safety project, at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The NRC said it was posting more inspectors at the two Florida plants and was considering sending more inspectors to plants in Georgia and South Carolina should the storm head that way. The NRC said the plants should not be compromised by Irma's storm surge." he storm surge forecasts that we have seen so far do not challenge the sites' designs," said NRC spokesman Scott Burnell. Both Florida plants have previously weathered major storms. Turkey Point took a hit from Hurricane Andrew, a Category 5 storm, in 1992, damaging a smokestack at fossil fuel plant at the site. Repairs cost about $90 million. St Lucie withstood the back-to-back impact of Hurricanes Frances (Category 2) and Jeanne (Category 3) in 2004. FPL shut St Lucie last October as Hurricane Matthew skirted the Florida coast. Lochbaum said the NRC and the industry could do more to reduce vulnerability to flooding. In January 2014, about 50,000 gallons of rainwater leaked into the St Lucie plant after a heavy downpour. An NRC study blamed degraded and missing flood seals that were not discovered during checks after Fukushima. There is also spent nuclear fuel at the site of a third power plant in Florida which stopped operating in 2009. That is the Crystal River plant, owned by Duke Energy Corp. Duke is in the process of transferring used fuel from the spent fuel pool at the plant to dry cask storage as part of work to decommission the plant. Once in storage, the fuel no longer needs cooling. The NRC's Burnell said Duke has suspended work to transfer the rods ahead of Irma. He said the fuel was safe and the plant also has backup power, even though it has been shut for years. Irma is expected to disrupt much of Florida's power supply. FPL, the state's largest electric company, has warned Irma could cut service to about 4.1 million of its nearly 5 million customers. FPL is one of four large publicly traded utilities in Florida. Other natural disasters since Fukushima have shut some plants. An earthquake in Virginia in 2011 shut Dominion Energy Inc's North Anna plant for about 2-1/2 months, the time it took to complete a full damage inspection. That plant sustained no major damage. Hurricane Sandy in 2012 caused three reactors in the U.S. Northeast to shut but inflicted no serious damage.	False

California Democrats and Republicans unite to defy Trump with climate change bill Donald Trump has singlehandedly been working to set back U.S. climate policy 50 years. He outraged the world by exiting the Paris climate agreement. He fired scientists from government advisory positions. He signed a bill to let coal mines dump waste into streams. He is trying to undo the Clean Power Plan, fuel economy standards for cars, offshore drilling restrictions, and solar tax credits. But at the state level, politicians are fighting back, and nowhere more so than in California. On Monday, the California state legislature passed a sweeping deal to extend the state's current cap and trade program until 2030. The law requires businesses to buy credits based on their volume of greenhouse pollution. The passage of this bill is a rare bipartisan victory. Democrats control both chambers of the California legislature, but the bill required a supermajority. Republicans cast the deciding votes, amid the endorsement of prominent California GOP politicians like former Gov. Pete Wilson. California has been at the forefront of the climate change fight ever since Trump was elected. Gov. Jerry Brown made news in December for telling Trump that if he scuttles climate research satellites, "California will launch its own damn satellites." More recently, Brown helped found the United States Climate Alliance, a group of state and local governments pledging to abide by the Paris climate agreement even after the federal government withdraws. So far, 10 states, including two with Republican governors, have joined, as well as several major cities. Even if Trump is willing to turn his back on our allies and our future to roll back the clock on environmental protection, states like California are standing up and assuming the mantle of leadership. The fight for the environment is a fight for the secure future of human civilization, and Trump cannot stop that fight.	True

Interior Department halts study on Appalachia coal mining The Trump administration has halted a study looking at the health risks of mountaintop removal coal mining. In a letter written on Friday, the Interior Department announced the shutdown of the study, which was started in 2016 under former President Barack Obama, while the department undergoes an agency-wide budgetary review. Scientists estimate at least 500 Appalachian mountaintops have undergone mountaintop removal mining, a form of surface mining that harvests coal deposits too thin to work from a coal mine. The study had been launched at the request of two West Virginia agencies, the state's Department of Environmental Protection and Bureau for Public Health. Ordered by the Obama administration, the $1million, two-year study looked to investigate mountaintop removal in West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee. An emphasis was placed on studying the 'effects from surface coal mining operations on air, surface water, groundwater, and drinking water quality and on ecologic communities and soil that could potentially lead to human health concerns.'This came after a 2010 study in Science magazine reported an increase in mortality rates as well as an increase in incidences of lung cancer and kidney disease near where mountaintop mining is common. Birth defects were also reported in a 2011 study published in Science Daily. Some suggest the move may be part of President Donald Trump's efforts to bring back coal. In February, he scrapped the Stream Protection Rule, a regulation to protect waterways from coal mining waste and promised to bring back coal mining jobs. Additionally, his proposed 2018 budget would cut funding for the Office of Surface Mining, which is responsible for protecting society and the environment from the adverse effects of surface coal mining operations. Critics have railed against the Interior Department for moves seen as halting scientific growth. Several science advisory boards were frozen earlier this year by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. And Interior Department climate scientist Joel Clement alleged that he and dozens of other scientists had been arbitrarily reassigned.'It's infuriating that Trump would halt this study on the health effects of mountaintop removal coal mining, research that people in Appalachia have been demanding for years,' Bill Price, Senior Appalachia Organizing Representative for Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign, said in a statement.'Stopping this study is a ploy to stop science in its tracks and keep the public in the dark about health risks as a favor to the mining industry, pure and simple,' said Democratic Representative Raúl Grijalva of Arizona, ranking member of the House Committee on Natural Resources, in a statement.

")During Wheeler's testimony in a congressional hearing last fall, he dodged a question about climate change: "I believe that man has an impact on the climate, but it's not completely understood what that impact is," he said, according to Inside Climate News.	Inhofe is known for denying that climate change is affected by human activity, once throwing a snowball onto the Senate floor to counter arguments about climate change and prove that it was "very, very cold" outside.	Pruitt was Oklahoma's attorney general before being named to Trump's Cabinet, and an outsider who recklessly took advantage of the privileges he obtained.		A brief guide to Andrew Wheeler, Scott Pruitt's replacement at the EPA Following the pile-up of months and months of scandals, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is finally out — which means a significantly less notorious successor is now in. Introduced to the world via a tweet from President Donald Trump, EPA Deputy Administrator Andrew Wheeler is set to take over the position in an acting capacity. Wheeler, who was confirmed for the EPA deputy role in April, appears to be cut from much of the same cloth as his former boss when it comes to rolling back environmental regulations. Here are three key facts to know about the person who will soon be overseeing the Environmental Protection Agency. Wheeler, age 55, is a former lobbyist who represented Murray Energy, a massive mining company, as one of his chief clients. Murray Energy was among the companies Wheeler listed on his financial disclosures while he was being considered for the deputy administrator position. Others included Xcel Energy and General Mills. Murray Energy CEO Robert Murray is also a well-known Trump adviser and supporter, who Wheeler worked with closely. As a New York Times story lays out, Murray was the architect of a so-called environmental regulations wish list, which detailed a list of policies aimed at reinvigorating the coal industry — like curbing restrictions on greenhouse gases and slashing staff at the EPA. Wheeler and Murray were photographed at a March 2017 meeting with Energy Secretary Rick Perry, where many of these policies were purportedly discussed. All this suggests that Wheeler won't be particularly aggressive toward the coal industry while in office. "Andrew Wheeler's coal credentials are without equal," Sen. Edward Markey has said, according to CBS News. "He is, without question, a member of the coal industry's Hall of Fame." Wheeler was also a longtime staffer for Sen. Jim Inhofe, serving as chief counsel for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee while the lawmaker was chair, according to Inside Climate News. All told, Wheeler spent 14 years working with Inhofe on the Hill. Inhofe was among Pruitt's biggest fans, although the barrage of scandals ultimately began to dim his enthusiasm. Inhofe is known for denying that climate change is affected by human activity, once throwing a snowball onto the Senate floor to counter arguments about climate change and prove that it was "very, very cold" outside. (His former staffers have become nicknamed by some as the "Inhofe mafia.")During Wheeler's testimony in a congressional hearing last fall, he dodged a question about climate change: "I believe that man has an impact on the climate, but it's not completely understood what that impact is," he said, according to Inside Climate News. As the New York Times points out, however, there is one crucial way that Wheeler differs from his departing boss. Pruitt was Oklahoma's attorney general before being named to Trump's Cabinet, and an outsider who recklessly took advantage of the privileges he obtained. Wheeler is seen as a seasoned political operative who knows how to carefully traverse the system. (He was also at the EPA as a special assistant in the agency's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics for four years before he worked for Inhofe.)Pruitt's goals as EPA administrator have centered on crafting (or destroying) policy in order to establish a friendlier regime for the fossil fuel industry. His efforts have included revising emissions standards for cars and trucks, increasing his control over the implementation of the Clean Water Act and weakening standards on hazardous chemicals. It appears that Wheeler is on track to do more of the same — and his insider instincts and methodical nature could mean even more effective rollbacks. (A number of Pruitt policies are thought to be shoddily constructed and have faced significant legal challenges.)As Trump said himself, "I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda."

You wouldn't like it if I went into your home, your land, and started digging."	"Hovenweep is in all of our stories, and to threaten the integrity of these structures jeopardizes everything we've carried forward as resilient people."	The sale comes amid an ongoing debate over drilling in states like Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico, where a coalition of tribes are calling for a halt on energy development near land that Native Americans consider sacred.	Still, environmentalists and Native Americans invested in the land said such documents fail to address a larger trend of leasing increasingly more land on or near sensitive tribal landscapes.		Oil Drilling Plan Near Sacred Utah Monument Draws Tribal Opposition Included in the Bureau of Land Management's September oil and gas lease sale is about 47 square miles (122 square kilometers) of land north of Hovenweep National Monument, a group of prehistoric villages overlooking a canyon with connections to several indigenous tribes throughout the U.S. Southwest. The parcels for lease are about five to 20 miles (eight to 32 kilometers) north of the monument. The sale comes amid an ongoing debate over drilling in states like Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico, where a coalition of tribes are calling for a halt on energy development near land that Native Americans consider sacred. The Trump administration has pushed to open vast expanses of public lands to oil and gas drilling, speed up the construction of petroleum pipelines and ease federal environmental regulations, dismissing calls from scientists in and out of government that immediate cuts in oil, gas and coal emissions are required to stave off the worst of climate change." hen this oil and gas leasing happens on or near sacred lands, it risks de-stabilizing the bedrock (of the structures)," said Ahjani Yepa, a member of Utah Diné Bikéyah, a Navajo grass-roots organization. "Hovenweep is in all of our stories, and to threaten the integrity of these structures jeopardizes everything we've carried forward as resilient people." Hovenweep was designated as an International Dark Sky Park in 2014 by the International Dark-Sky Association, recognized for its striking night skies and star-gazing opportunities. Southeast Utah is known for its sweeping desert landscapes and expansive night skies. The state has 11 internationally recognized "Dark Sky Parks," the most of any state. Business owners in Bluff said the dark skies drive tourism to Hovenweep, and feared industrial light pollution, as well as the sounds and smells of energy development, could drive visitors away. As of Monday afternoon, Finch said there were no results to share and the sale would continue until at least Tuesday. The agency says in planning documents that companies should take steps to protect the environmental and cultural landscape of the area, including limiting the use of artificial light at drilling sites and protecting useable groundwater aquifers from drilling. Companies must obtain permits and go through environmental reviews before they begin construction or drilling. Some leases go years before drilling or expire before any activity occurs. Still, environmentalists and Native Americans invested in the land said such documents fail to address a larger trend of leasing increasingly more land on or near sensitive tribal landscapes. Parcels near Hovenweep were offered, then deferred, in a March BLM lease sale, and new documents for an upcoming December lease sale show more land will be up for grabs." t least we have our little foot in the door, but that's as far as we've gotten," she said. "They argue these lands are abandoned, but they're not, we use them in our prayers, we visit them. You wouldn't like it if I went into your home, your land, and started digging." The Bureau of Land Management would benefit from more community outreach and long-term planning to lease parcels on sensitive landscapes, said Erika Pollard, an associate director with the National Parks Conservation Association. But the new "energy-dominated era" she said we're in has made public input on these processes harder.	True

Why is it that Democrats, clearly lacking in any context of what World War II and living in the greatest generation were like, enjoy comparing these things to mundane policy initiatives?Addressing the Green New Deal, O'Rourke summoned his followers to harness the "the most ingenious mechanism yet devised by humankind" to "free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels." The mechanism Robert Francis is referring to is a democracy. Meanwhile, what comes out of Beto's mouth next is not, in fact, ingenious." t's exactly what we did to face the Nazi threat, the existential threat to Western democracies in 1941," he said.

Kamala Harris was the first candidate to mention the Green New Deal in the first presidential debate, when she corrected NBC moderator Chuck Todd. "I don't even call it climate change," she said. "It's a climate crisis…That is why I support a Green New Deal." And yet, of the top four presidential candidates, Harris has the thinnest legislative record when it comes to climate change; her 2019 bill to electrify school bus fleets has taken only a slice at the problem. On Monday, the day before the second round of debates among the 20 Democratic presidential hopefuls, she released the first major climate proposal of her campaign, partnering with the original author of the Green New Deal resolution, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The proposal, called the Climate Equity Act, is not a comprehensive plan for addressing the climate crisis or cutting pollution, but it focuses on addressing equity and environmental racism, echoing the broader themes of Harris' campaign. It does begin to answer one of the key questions around the Green New Deal debate, which is how to include low-income and communities of color—the frontline voices facing the most dire effects of climate change—in the legislative process." rom the toxic air embattling Cancer Alley in Louisiana and Asthma Alley in the Bronx to the unsafe drinking water in California's San Joaquin Valley and Flint, Michigan," Harris said, "the nation's bedrock environmental protections have not stopped frontline communities from continually falling through the cracks." The proposal requires that any environmental legislation receive an equity score to assess its impact on frontline communities, much in the same way the Congressional Budget Office scores the economic costs and impacts of bills. The proposal also requires an extra level of scrutiny for White House executive actions on low-income communities and people of color and feedback from those affected communities. A new Climate and Environmental Justice office would coordinate all the impact assessment efforts." e cannot accept a status quo where children of color are drinking toxic water in Flint or breathing toxic air in Louisiana's Cancer Alley," Harris said in a statement. "This systemic environmental injustice will only get worse and become more ingrained if climate and environmental policies like the Green New Deal do not specifically focus on lifting up these communities." Mustafa Ali, the former head of the EPA environmental justice office, noted that the idea of scoring environmental justice impacts is something advocates have pushed for years. "When you look at where most of the fossil fuel facilities are located, they are in communities of color," Ali said. "That same pollution is warming up our planet and warming our oceans. People are starting to pay at lot of attention to climate change and have to address the environmental injustices." Harris is not the only presidential candidate who has come out with a plan focused on environmental justice. Jay Inslee released the fifth plank of his climate change package on Monday that refocuses the White House Council of Environmental Quality as a new clearinghouse for environmental justice and has its own scoring mechanism for impacts.

Around 44,000 troops and military aircraft will be made available for what has been described as an "unprecedented" effort to fight fires in at least six Brazilian states. It remains unclear how many of those troops will be put on the line to combat the forest fires. Although fires are common this time of year, they are more widespread. So far nearly 77,000 wildfires have been reported across the country this year, which marked an 85 percent increase from the same period last year. And while the fires have been burning for weeks, the international outcry grew this week as photographs spread on social media. Protests took place in Brazil and across the world Friday and Saturday demanding that the Brazilian government take action.

Yet his tune appeared to change after leaders in Europe said a major trade deal could be at risk and many on social media started calling for a boycott of Brazilian products. Bolsonaro approved the involvement of the military to help put out fires in a televised speech Friday in which he claimed his government would have "zero tolerance" for environmental crimes. "Protecting the rain forest is our duty," he said. That was quite a change in tune for a president who had previously described environmental protections as an impediment for economic growth and had blamed non-governmental organizations of starting the fires.

"Once you have a huge forest fire like that, especially when you don't have all the kind of forest fire-fighting equipment that you have in places like the U.S. or Portugal, it's difficult to extinguish," Alfredo Sirkis, executive director of Brazil Climate Center, a think tank, said. "They'll only be extinguished by themselves depending on the weather conditions." It was clear though that deploying the military was also in part a public relations ploy. A military leader, for example, said that part of its mission involved creating "a positive perception of the country." As attention focused on the fires burning in the Amazon, it became clear that Europeans have taken the role as the global leaders in the fight against climate change, notes the New York Times. As European leaders, led by French President Emanuel Macron, criticized Brazil for its inaction, President Donald Trump waited until Friday evening to say that the United States was willing to help only to add that "future trade prospects" with Brazil "are very exciting."

AOC Has Found Another Thing to Nonsensically Blame on the "Climate Crisis" Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has found something else to blame on the supposed "climate crisis."A few weeks ago she let us all know that heavy rain in a city built on a swamp was absolute proof of catastrophic global warming. She posted a picture of a few inches of water and called it "unprecedented flooding," even though Washington D.C. has had actual major floods several times throughout it's relatively short history. Then there was the explosion at an oil refinery, which despite not being a weather event at all (nor being caused by one), was somehow the fault of climate change. Weird how everything just so happens to reinforce her political narrative and now she's back with another hot take. You see, it rained in New York City and that was obviously caused by global warming. Did it rain a lot? No, not really. There was no record rainfall or a weeks worth of severe storms. It just…rained, something it has presumably been doing there for millions of years. In reality, New York City's subway system is a dumpster fire of mismanagement. The city's communist Mayor, Bill de Blasio, has run it into the ground with stupid financial decisions and misuse of funds. You see, they've got money to pay for illegal alien's healthcare, but they can't keep the trains running or the sewage systems from backing up. The flooding in this case wasn't because of a massive downpour. It was because the infrastructure is falling apart. If a pipe bursts in your house, that's not the fault of climate change. On a broader note, I'm confused. What happened to climate change leading to massive desertification and droughts? Now, the alarmists want to complain about rain and flooding, as if those are new phenomenons on the earth?

426	thehuffingtonpost	left_bias	2018-03-02	Gutting the EPA's rules on coal ash pollution takes some pressure off the utilities, but thrusts the industry back into the sort of "regulatory uncertainty" Pruitt vowed to alleviate.	In 2014, before the EPA passed its coal ash rule, the American Coal Ash Association, a trade group, complained about "regulatory uncertainty that has impeded the beneficial use of coal ash for half a decade."	Yet, two years later, the company is still battling environmentalists and regulators in the state as the utility seeks to pass the cleanup costs onto ratepayers in the form of a price hike.	They face contaminated drinking water, toxic dust in the air, and serious health threats just because the EPA is choosing to side with polluters over the public."	Scrapping the only federal rules on coal ash presents a major problem  in the face of storms, floods and other extreme weather made more frequent and intense by climate change.		Scott Pruitt Just Gutted Rules To Fight The Nation's 'Second Biggest Toxic Pollution Threat' The EPA's announcement makes no mention of the risks coal ash poses to human health and the environment. Rather, the agency justified its move by noting it is expected to save the utility sector between $31 and $100 million annually." oday's coal ash proposal embodies EPA's commitment to our state partners by providing them with the ability to incorporate flexibilities into their coal ash permit programs based on the needs of their states," Pruitt said in a statement. Coal-fired power plants in the United States produce roughly 140 million tons of coal ash per year, containing toxic heavy metals such as arsenic, lead, selenium and other carcinogenic substances. The waste product is typically stored in wet ponds, nearly 46 percent of which operated without liners to prevent hazardous chemicals from seeping into groundwater, according to 2012 data released by the EPA. Living within a mile of a wet coal ash storage pond poses a greater health threat than smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, raising the risk of cancer to one in 50, an EPA study from 2010 found. Children are particularly at risk of learning disabilities, birth defects, asthma and cancer, with 1.54 million living near such storage sites, according to EPA data cited by the Sierra Club." his is the second biggest toxic pollution threat in our country, and we need to clean it up – not make things easier for polluters," Earthjustice attorney Lisa Evans said in a statement. "People living near more than a thousand toxic coal ash sites are at risk. They face contaminated drinking water, toxic dust in the air, and serious health threats just because the EPA is choosing to side with polluters over the public." In 2014, the EPA catalogued 158 cases where coal ash compromised water quality, including 22 that involved recycled waste product. And a government study in 2012 estimated that the damage to fish and wildlife at 21 disposal sites came at a cost of more than $2.3 billion, "enough money to construct 155 landfills with state-of-the-art composite liners and leachate collection systems." The rule change marks the Trump administration's latest rollback of clean water regulations  at a time when drinking water contamination crises are proliferating across the country. In February 2017, less than a month after taking office, President Donald Trump signed a bill to allow coal companies to dump waste into streams. In June, the EPA moved to repeal the 2015 Waters of the U.S. rule that extended 1972 Clean Water Act protections to roughly 20 million acres of wetlands and streams. The agency formally suspended the rule on Jan. 31. Scrapping the only federal rules on coal ash presents a major problem  in the face of storms, floods and other extreme weather made more frequent and intense by climate change. When Hurricane Maria made landfall over Puerto Rico last year, flood waters swelled the river in the city of Guayama, wreaking havoc on the city's 42,000 residents and distributing its five-story-tall tower of coal ash. Coal ash in particular has long been a hot-button issue in the utility industry. In 2014, Duke Energy, one of the country's biggest power companies, spilled nearly 39,000 tons of coal ash into the Dan River, causing one of North Carolina's biggest environmental disasters in its history. In 2016, then Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed a bill that dramatically watered down legislation forcing Duke to clean up its coal ash pits without requiring the company to excavate the waste or provide clean water to residents near the pond. Yet, two years later, the company is still battling environmentalists and regulators in the state as the utility seeks to pass the cleanup costs onto ratepayers in the form of a price hike. In a separate legal fight over coal ash, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation's biggest public utility, last month appealed a federal judge's order to clean up decades of coal ash environmentalists say poisoned water in the Volunteer State. Eighteen states and an alliance of big corporate interests urged an appeals court to overturn the decision last month. Gutting the EPA's rules on coal ash pollution takes some pressure off the utilities, but thrusts the industry back into the sort of "regulatory uncertainty" Pruitt vowed to alleviate. In 2014, before the EPA passed its coal ash rule, the American Coal Ash Association, a trade group, complained about "regulatory uncertainty that has impeded the beneficial use of coal ash for half a decade." It's unclear whether Pruitt's new rule promotes recycling coal ash for other uses. Coal ash can be used to pave roads, though the environmentalists say even that poses pollution risks. And last year, Purdue University researchers announced new technology to sift rare earth elements ― highly-valued components used in electronics and renewable energy hardware ― out of coal ash waste. Thomas Adams, executive director of the American Coal Ash Association, said he hopes the next part of the EPA's announcement will include changing a rule that mandates companies to go through a risk evaluation when stockpiling more than 12,400 tons of coal ash for anything other than road projects. The EPA set the threshold in 2015 based on what Adams called an "arithmetic error" that he argued hurts the market for using coal ash in cement manufacturing or to fill structures such as building foundations. He said he hopes the EPA will raise the limit to 75,000 tons. Thursday's announcement is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to end a perceived "war" on coal waged by the Obama administration. Last year, the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group petitioned the EPA to roll back the Obama-era coal ash rule, calling it "burdensome, inflexible, and often impracticable." The organization of some 80 utilities warned that regulating coal ash disposal would "result in significant economic and operational impacts to coal-fired power generation," and could even force power plants to shut down.

Ocasio-Cortez said at an event in New York City Monday night.	org.		Ocasio-Cortez's Climate Alarm Isn't Shocking. She's Just Repeating Months Of Media Narrative Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's claim the "world is gonna end in 12 years" shouldn't come as a shock to anyone because she's only repeating the same doomsday narrative pushed by some scientists and news outlets for months. In fact, Ocasio-Cortez followed up her remarks from Monday night with a couple tweets doubling down on her 12-year warning, but also showing she didn't make it up. The freshman Democrat pointed to a Vox article warning "we have just 12 years to limit devastating global warming" and a Guardian article claiming "[w]e have 12 years to limit climate change catastrophe" — both articles were based on a United Nations report from October 2018. That U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report examined what would need to be done in order to limit future global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100. The report was mandated by the Paris climate accord. The IPCC reported greenhouse gas emissions would need to fall 45 percent below 2010 levels by 2030, and then reach zero by 2050 for a 66 percent chance of keeping projected warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. (RELATED: Another Headline-Grabbing Ocean Warming Study Is Full Of 'Factual Errors And Misleading Statements,' Scientist Says)And in the months since that report, news has been inundated with headlines warning it's "worse than we thought" or the world's ice sheets are reaching a "tipping point." The most widely reported climate study in 2018 warned we were on track for a "hothouse Earth." Nearly ever natural disaster in 2018 were tied to global warming in some way, from California's devastating wildfires to hurricanes Florence and Michael. All the news stories stressing climate alarm spurred calls for action on global warming. However, many experts looking at the IPCC's report saw it as infeasible to completely overhaul the global ecology in 12 years, and there are serious questions about the accuracy of U.N. climate models. Yet, IPCC report authors framed this as a problem of "political will," not economics and technology. The report itself says "there is no documented historic precedent" for the sweeping changes needed to fight global warming. That's the line activists and many politicians have taken up in the months since the IPCC's report. Indeed, Ocasio-Cortez said global warming is her generation's World War II. And what preceded World War II? The New Deal. Ocasio-Cortez now wants a Green New Deal to move the U.S. away from fossil fuels and address a variety of injustices she sees in our current economic system." nd I think for younger people looking at this are more like, how are we saying let's take it easy when 3,000 Americans died last year, how are we saying let's take it easy when the end person died from our cruel and unjust criminal justice system?" Ocasio-Cortez said at an event in New York City Monday night.

It's going to be something, to quote another movie, from the movie The Fly, 'Be afraid, be very afraid.' And that's what they're preaching. They're preaching fear." At times, Pendley's denial of climate change has drifted into even more fringe claims linking the broader US environmental movement to the fall of the Soviet Union and communism." Because of the collapse of communism, because the wall has come down, because the Soviet Union is no more... the environmental movement is the last refuge of people who favor government over people," he said." Who knew? Islam's war with America started just up the road in Greeley, Colorado!," Pendley tweeted. In the article, Spencer floats unfounded conspiracies about "leftists" allying with "Islamic hardliners who adhere to Sharia, a system of laws that would have many of them executed." (New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and President Barack Obama) think -- if one can call it thinking or anything more than wishful thinking—that Americans should be afraid of terrorist attacks, not from all those who embrace radical Islam, but from their countrymen who hold very strong views on important issues of the day?," Pendley wrote. Pendley has repeatedly used extreme rhetoric to refer to undocumented immigrants." You see, the problems Hazleton or Valley Park faces could be in your community next because illegal immigration is spreading like a cancer," Pendley wrote. "Partly this is because Mexico and some other governments promote and encourage illegal immigration into our country." Pendley went on to say if "massive immigration" continued "you and I will permanently lose the country we love""Frustrated by the failure of the federal government to address the issue of illegal immigration and the problems it poses for the tiny, cash-strapped city -- including violent crime, crowded schools, hospital costs, and the demand for services—the City Council, at the request of Mayor Lou Barletta, adopted legislation to deal with these problems." Violent crime—including dangerous gangs, over-crowded schools, the appearance of diseases once vanquished from the western world, escalating hospital costs, and an overwhelming demand for government services!" Pendley wrote. "These are the new problems being faced by small, cash-strapped cities and towns all across America. The source: illegal immigrants."	True

Thousands of people across the U.S. are marking President Donald Trump's hundredth day in office by marching in protest of his environmental policies. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)APIt seems like every week there's a new story about some completely unprecedented, unpredictable environmental event. Antarctica is turning green. California is paralyzed by drought. Forests are shifting, and the first climate refugees have lost their homes. The climate is changing, and quickly. And we aren't keeping up with it. This isn't because there is not enough scientific evidence to prove the threat—there is. It isn't because the majority of Americans don't believe climate change is caused by human activity—they do. And it isn't, as has been suggested, because we've become so immune to data that numbers aren't persuasive anymore. We aren't keeping up with climate change because the environmental movement is allowing a legacy of implicit bias to constrict its leadership and strategy. By refusing to challenge the long-held belief that white environmentalists are the most informed, prepared, passionate, dedicated defenders of our planet and its natural resources, the movement silences communities of color. It silences the very people who often feel the greatest impact of a warming planet, even though activists of color could make or break success for this work. In our new report, Green 2.0 found that the environmental movement—from boards, to executive leadership, to staff—is still overwhelmingly white. Green 2.0 is an advocacy campaign that monitors and supports diversifying the racial and ethnic demography of mainstream environmental NGOs, foundations, and federal government agencies. We help hiring managers and executive search firms access the deep pipeline of qualified candidates of color, help organizations build an equitable and inclusive culture internally, and advocate for data transparency across the sector. For the past three years, we have been working to build our database of the diversity of the top 40 NGOs across the movement. In 2014, we reported their staff and leadership demographics to create the first-ever snapshot of the sector. It was that baseline that we used in the report we release today, the "Transparency Card," which evaluates what kind of change has been made. We saw some encouraging progress. Overall, environmental organizations have committed to improving diversity among their staff and board since we started this work.  It is evidenced by the number of diversity committees, managers and plans that have sprung up since 2014.  Across the movement, people of color represent 27%, 15% 24% of staff, leadership and board positions respectively in 2017. But there's still much more work to be done. More than 70% of those working in the space are white. Diversity is still seriously lacking at the senior leadership level. Two organizations—Oceana and the Pew Charitable Trusts—refused to even participate in the survey. This is problem, and not just a theoretical one. From Flint to Standing Rock, we've seen that communities of color are disproportionately affected by pollution and climate change. When they don't have a seat at the table, how can the movement be ready to systematically tackle issues that affect them uniquely? Without people of color in leadership and policymaking positions, their perspectives are less likely to be included in outcomes. And furthermore, with the environmental challenges facing us right now—from the new energy economy to ocean acidification—we need all the creativity available to help us find pathways to clean food, water, and air. It's simple: the more diverse the group discussing the problem is, the more comprehensive, sustainable, and creative the solutions are. The time has come for radical thinking, for inclusive problem-solving, for crowd-sourced innovation. We have spent decades leaving people of color out of the environmental movement. It's time that we own our mistakes and get real about our shortcomings. It's long overdue that we intentionally count how many people of color are staffing and leading the professional environmental sector. It's urgent that we bring more voices into the conversation. Or we could let implicit bias and systemic racism undercut any chance we have at a sustainable future. The planet isn't going to wait for us to get this right. It's already far outpacing our efforts to respond to the crisis of climate change. It's time we stop letting it. Whitney Tome is the Executive Director of Green 2.0	False

Soil damage 'set to fuel climate change' Climate change can't be halted if we carry on degrading the soil, a report will say. There's three times more carbon in the soil than in the atmosphere – but that carbon's being released by deforestation and poor farming. This is fuelling climate change – and compromising our attempts to feed a growing world population, the authors will say. Problems include soils being eroded, compacted by machinery, built over, or harmed by over-watering. Hurting the soil affects the climate in two ways: it compromises the growth of plants taking in carbon from the atmosphere, and it releases soil carbon previously stored by worms taking leaf matter underground. The warning will come from the awkwardly-named IPBES – the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services - a panel studying the benefits of nature to humans. The body, which is meeting this week, aims to get all the world's governments singing from the same sheet about the need to protect natural systems. IPBES will formally release its report on Monday 6 May. About 3.2 billion people worldwide are suffering from degraded soils, said IPBES chairman Prof Sir Bob Watson." That's almost half of the world population. There's no question we are degrading soils all over the world. We are losing from the soil the organic carbon and this undermines agricultural productivity and contributes to climate change. We absolutely have to restore the degraded soil we've got." Governments have focused on climate change far more than they have focused on loss of biodiversity or land degradation. All three are equally important to human wellbeing." Soil expert Prof Jane Rickson from Cranfield University, UK, added: "The thin layer of soil covering the Earth's surface represents the difference between survival and extinction for most terrestrial life." Only 3% of the planet's surface is suitable for arable production and 75 billion tonnes of fertile soil is lost to land degradation every year." She said soils form at a rate of 1cm in 300 years. There's uncertainty about the exact level of global soil degradation. But the major hotspots are reported to be in South America, where forests are being felled; sub-Saharan Africa; India and China. Soil scientists in both the biggest Asian nations are worried that their ability to grow their own food may be compromised. In the US, some soils are being restored as forests take over poor quality land previously worked by small farmers, but others are still being degraded. The UK is not immune either. Some maize fields in south-west England suffer major soil loss with heavy rainfall because growing maize leaves bare soil exposed. Heavy rain is more likely under climate change. Erosion is also a long-standing issue in the fertile Fens, where, on dry windy days, peaty soil particles sometimes form a kind of smog called the "Fen Blow". Peat has a high carbon content – and a recent paper suggests there's far more carbon being lost from peatlands than previously thought. And on the chalky hills of southern England, chemical-intensive crop farming is said to have caused the loss of over a foot of soil in some places. Soils are "incredibly important" for our well-being, said Dr Joanna Clark from Reading University." We all know that crops are grown in soil, but soils are important for climate change as well. There's three times more carbon stored in soil than there is in the atmosphere. So imagine if all that carbon was released, we'd get runaway climate change. So we need to keep the carbon in the soil." The simplest way to protect soils while combating climate change is to let forests grow back. This option is favoured by fans of re-wilding. But some farmers believe they can continue to produce food by changing the way they farm to enhance the soil. Brexit could give the UK greater flexibility on how to spend public money on farming - enabling much more leeway to reward farmers for capturing carbon in the earth. But there are more than 700 soil types in the UK alone, so it won't be simple.	False

EPA rolls back Obama-era plan limiting coal-fired power plant emissions The move fulfills part of President Donald Trump's promise to help the coal industry, but will likely face court challenges from environmental groups and several states who see the rollback as detrimental to clean air and efforts to fight the climate crisis. Former President Barack Obama's plan, if implemented, would have prevented 3,600 premature deaths a year, 1,700 heart attacks and 90,000 asthma attacks, according to analysis conducted by the EPA under his tenure. The Obama Clean Power Plan was set to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to the climate crisis, by up to 32% compared to 2005 levels by the same year." We are gathered here today because the American public elected a president with a better approach," EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said Wednesday. In an initial announcement about the proposal last summer, the Trump EPA labeled Obama's plan as "overly prescriptive and burdensome." Instead, the administration says the plan rule "instead empowers states, promotes energy independence, and facilitates economic growth and job creation," the release stated. RELATED: More coal-fired power plants have closed under Trump than in Obama's first term Democrats are betting big on big plans for 2020 Obama's Clean Power Plan was challenged by several lawsuits from industry groups and conservative-led states. In 2016, the Supreme Court blocked the regulation, but some plants had already started to work on reducing pollution. The new plan, which EPA is calling the Affordable Clean Energy rule, is designed to boost the struggling coal industry but also likely increase carbon emissions nationwide. EPA argues that any comparison to the Obama rule is incongruous because it was never implemented. "The Affordable Clean Energy rule -- ACE -- gives states the regulatory certainty they need to continue to reduce emissions and provide affordable and reliable energy for all Americans," Wheeler said. "Unlike the CPP, the ACE rule adheres to the four corners of the Clean Air Act. EPA sets the best system of emission reductions and then states set the standards of performance." But it's unclear how much the industry can benefit, as it faces competition from cheap natural gas and renewable sources. US coal consumption has plunged 39% to the lowest level in 40 years, according to the US Energy Information Administration. RELATED: America's renewable energy capacity is now greater than coal New York Attorney General Letitia James said her state and others will go to court. "Given its clear violation of the Clean Air Act, I intend to sue the EPA over this "Dirty Power" rule and look forward to collaborating with other states and cities in taking action to protect all Americans from the increasingly disastrous impacts of climate change," James said in a statement. "Connecticut is in close coordination with states across the nation and we are prepared to take legal action to block this measure," the state's attorney general, William Tong. "There is no serious debate -- climate change is a severe threat and we ignore science at our own peril." At a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing last week about the direction of the EPA, former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy -- who finalized the Clean Power Plan under Obama -- said she believes the proposed Affordable Clean Energy rule, as well as other proposed rules the agency has made since Trump took office, undermines "the science and the law in how they're trying to roll back those rules." "I do not dispute any administration coming in with different policies, but the challenge I think we're facing is they are really changing the rules of the road and not using sound science," McCarthy said. "They are not looking at cost benefits. They are trying to inflate the cost and lower the benefits in order to justify rules that simply don't make sense under the law."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) waves at an enthusiastic crowd of hometown supporters, half of whom raised their hands when MSNBC host Chris Hayes, a fellow Bronx native, asked who was from the borough. On Tuesday, four members of the Senate's Democratic caucus joined every Republican in voting to block a resolution staking out what should be in future Green New Deal legislation. On Wednesday, conservatives' leading voice of reason on climate change published a widely shared essay that offered talking points to oppose the Green New Deal without invoking hamburger bans, Stalinism or genocide. On Thursday night, President Donald Trump smeared the Green New Deal as "an extreme, $100 trillion government takeover" at a rally in Michigan, leading the crowd in chants of "AOC sucks." As her allies are readying primary challenges against Democrats who refuse to join the Green New Deal's 100 co-sponsors in Congress, Ocasio-Cortez said, "You don't necessarily have to replace everybody." Instead, she's betting the increasingly visible and deadly effects of climate change will unite a popular base so vast the market fundamentalists in both parties who oppose the kind of New Deal-era, big-government policies needed to match the scope of the climate crisis will fall in line. For years, positions in the debate over mainstream climate policies ranged from hard-line denial of climate change on one end to moderate market tweaks on the other. Democrats regularly introduced bills to put a price on carbon dioxide emissions through a cap-and-trade scheme or a carbon tax. Tax incentives for renewable energy sources like solar and wind enjoyed bipartisan support, yet so too did subsidies for oil and gas production. Then, in October, United Nations scientists forecast average temperatures to increase at least 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ― a catastrophic spike, likely to cost $54 trillion in damage and countless lives ― unless world governments took unprecedented measures to halve global emissions over the next decade. A month later, a congressionally mandated report by 13 federal agencies confirmed the research. The findings made clear that market fixes alone might have worked in the 1970s, when scientists first understood the climate impacts of burning fossil fuels, but now it's too late. That hasn't helped tamp down opposition from powerful building trades unions that rely on the pipeline and coal train industries for lucrative jobs. Countering the fossil fuel industry's appeal to organized labor is an uphill battle for Green New Deal advocates. Very few renewable energy jobs are unionized, and the steady march of right-to-work laws in red states over the past decade makes it difficult to envision a future in which new industries enjoy the same labor precedents as older ones. Ocasio-Cortez said that was one reason the Green New Deal movement could not abandon its class politics to secure support from avowedly pro-business conservatives." e cannot allow for the fossil fuel jobs to be better, more dignified and higher-waged with stronger labor support behind [them] than new energy jobs," she said. "What I'm tired of is us worrying more about the future of fossil fuels than worry about the future of fossil fuel workers." On Monday, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) cribbed the Green New Deal's rhetoric harkening to a World War II-level mobilization effort when he proposed a New Manhattan Project for Clean Energy that he said would "double federal funding for energy research" and implement a five-year plan to "create new sources of cheap, clean energy." That same week, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a loyal Trump ally, drafted a nonbinding resolution staking out a "Green Real Deal" that would acknowledge the threat climate change poses to "human health and safety" in "communities across the United States."

Wolf Rose Strauss apparently isn't showing favoritism in the race for Pennsylvania governor — at least when it comes to asking candidates about climate change. The 18-year-old activist made a name for herself beyond the Keystone State last month when she questioned Republican gubernatorial nominee Scott Wagner at a town hall on what she said was his lack of action on climate change and donations he received from the fossil fuel industry. And why did Strauss win the internet that day? Well, in a way she has Wagner to thank for that, as he responded by calling Strauss "a little young and naive" on video, which subsequently went viral. Wagner also asked the Glenside crowd, "Are we here to elect a governor, or are we here to elect a scientist?"Wagner in 2017 said climate change is likely occurring — but perhaps because "we have more people. You know, humans have warm bodies. So is heat coming off?" And his campaign has received $163,750 from the oil and gas industry, according to Vote Smart, a nonprofit political watch dog organization, the York Dispatch said. John Fetterman — the running mate for Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf — ripped Wagner on Twitter over his comments toward Strauss. He also used a "Young and Naive" slogan for $25 T-shirts, the York Daily Record reported, while Wolf's campaign announced "free limited edition" stickers using the phrase:It turns out all the T-shirts and stickers in the world immortalizing Wagner's words to her could not impede Strauss from turning her confrontation Wolf's way, as she and activists tried to intercept the governor as he walked into an event last week, the Daily Record said." om Wolf!

Wolf's campaign declined to say if he'll meet with Strauss and other activists but offered the following statement to the Daily Record:Governor Wolf is committed to protecting and preserving the environment. One of his first acts as governor was to sign an executive order reinstating the moratorium on new leases for drilling in state parks and forests and he has been fighting efforts by Republicans in Washington to cut EPA funding. Governor Wolf worked across party lines with the state legislature, which is heavily Republican, to pass the Chapter 78a Environmental Protection Performance Standards. This bipartisan agreement modernizes and strengthens environmental protections at oil and gas sites in Pennsylvania. He also announced a nation-leading strategy to reduce emissions of methane. Governor Wolf has met with environmentalists throughout the state to discuss ways they could work together to combat climate change and strengthen statewide regulations to ensure the protection of public health, safety, and the environment. He will continue to engage the environmental community throughout the commonwealth to ensure that their voices are heard." cott is having town halls to articulate his positions on the issues to people of all demographics and backgrounds," Wagner campaign spokesman Andrew Romeo told TheBlaze on Wednesday.

If voters want to know Scott's position on an issue they won't have to ambush him outside an event just to get a hold of him, they can come ask him their questions in person. He certainly won't bury his head and keep walking." Wagner has since clarified his "young and naive" comment, noting in a Sunday town hall that he didn't believe it was "mean" and that "I'm 62 years old, and the young lady asking the question was 18.

There is also a lot of noise.	Christine Shearer is an analyst with the group CoalSwarm, which tracks coal developments, and she is scathing about the implications."	In the next few months a lot of Chinese will come here and this will be a big challenge," he says."	An existing power station towers over the rolling landscape, a steady stream of pollution twisting from a massive smokestack, and conveyor belts ferry coal from a nearby open-cast mine at Drmno.		China-backed coal projects prompt climate change fears As levels of greenhouse gases reach a new record, concerns are growing about the role of China in global warming. For years, the increase in the number of Chinese coal-fired power stations has been criticised. Now environmental groups say China is also backing dozens of coal projects far beyond its borders. Coal is the most damaging of the fossil fuels because of the quantity of carbon dioxide it releases when it's burned. Last year, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reached its highest level for the past 3-5 million years, according to the latest research by the UN's weather agency, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). And last month the UN's climate science panel said that coal must be phased out by 2050 if the world is to have any chance of limiting the rise in temperatures. The Chinese-supported coal projects are under way or planned as far afield as South America, Africa, southeast Asia and the Balkans. Contracts and financing for these facilities are often not fully transparent but campaign groups including Bankwatch have tried to keep track." You cannot be a world leader in curbing air pollution and at the same time the world's biggest financier of overseas coal power plants," the group's energy coordinator Ioana Ciuta told the BBC. According to Ms Ciuta, efforts to tackle the dirty air of Chinese cities have led many power companies to limit their ambitions for coal-fired power stations in China itself and to target their technology and labour overseas instead." By having China invest in over 60 countries along the Belt and Road Initiative, it's perpetuating a source of pollution that has been demonstrated to be harmful not just to the climate but also to economies," she said. In Serbia, one of the country's largest coal-fired power stations is being expanded with the help of a loan from a Chinese bank and with the work being led by one of China's largest construction companies. An hour's drive east of the capital Belgrade, in the coal-rich Danube valley, construction has already started at the site, known as Kostolac B3. An existing power station towers over the rolling landscape, a steady stream of pollution twisting from a massive smokestack, and conveyor belts ferry coal from a nearby open-cast mine at Drmno. The power station is run by the national Serbian electricity company, EPS, which provides about 70% of the country's power by burning coal - the rest comes from hydro-electric schemes. Now, under a $715m (£560m) contract agreed by the Serbian government and Chinese President Xi Jinping, an extra unit is being added, which will bring 350MW of additional capacity with the latest "super-critical" technology. When we visit, we catch a brief glimpse of a group of Chinese workers wearing hard hats on their way from the construction site to a vast set of accommodation blocks - by next year, some 1,500 Chinese staff will be here. Safety signs and notice boards are written in Serbian and Chinese. Equipment and shipping containers carry Chinese labels.I ask the EPS official running the project, Zeljko Lazovic, what he feels about such a large and important venture being in the hands of Chinese engineers and workers." In the next few months a lot of Chinese will come here and this will be a big challenge," he says." With Chinese workers and Serbian workers, at the beginning we had some cultural problems but we have overcome them and there is now very good cooperation." When asked about the environmental cost of the new project, Mr Lazovic insisted it would meet all the EU's standards on pollution by dust, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur. However, the new unit will not be fitted with any carbon capture technology so it will fit into a pattern of Chinese-backed projects that will add to carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Christine Shearer is an analyst with the group CoalSwarm, which tracks coal developments, and she is scathing about the implications." These projects are not compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C or 2C," she said, referring to the two targets of the Paris Agreement on climate change. She says that Chinese financial institutions are filling a gap left by Western banks and agencies deciding to limit their involvement in coal." These projects, if completed, will lock the countries into high carbon-emitting infrastructure and volatile coal imports precisely at a time when prices for clean energy are starting to fall below that of coal power." We tried to contact the Export-Import Bank of China, which is providing the loan, and the China Machinery Engineering Corporation, which is leading the construction, but did not hear back. For the Serbian power company, EPS, the attraction of a local supply of coal has combined with a cheap Chinese loan and the prospects of valuable exports of electricity. About 3,500 jobs depend on the Kostolac complex but some local people have become increasingly outspoken about the pollution in the area. Momir Savic showed me how the conveyor belts carrying coal run close to the villages and he fears a further expansion of the operation." The quality of our air and water is very poor. We cannot grow fruit and vegetables. There is also a lot of noise. All this affects the health of people living here, many of whom have respiratory diseases," he said. EPS says it is spending hundreds of millions of euros on environmental protection but its track record clearly does not inspire trust. Pera Markovic, a lawyer with Cekor, an environmental group, is critical of the company's failure to limit pollution in the local area.

Perry did not quantify whether man-made greenhouse gases associated with climate change, such as carbon dioxide emissions from burning gasoline and coal or methane releases from natural gas and oil production, are the main problem or even whether they're causing the immediate and growing crisis that Democrats contend. However, Perry did say that it's still worth developing zero-emissions technology and that the Trump administration has made great strides in cleaner energy solutions." We're going to address the climate. It makes sense for us to have policies that reduce emissions, that reduce the pollutants that are in the air, to reduce the particles that cause massive health problems around the world," he said. "Common sense tells you, bring the cleaner burning fuels, bring the things that bring the emissions down. That's just common sense." Perry said the administration is reducing emissions — claiming without evidence or specificity that countries in the Paris climate agreement, with "their hair on fire" when President Donald Trump announced his intention to pull out two years ago, are not doing as much as the U.S. Trump has repeatedly over the years expressed skepticism about the role humans play in climate change. In 2017, then-Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt told CNBC he does not believe carbon dioxide is a primary contributor. On Monday, Trump talked about his administration's environmental record, saying America can lead the world in fighting pollution at the same time it promotes fossil fuels. Since taking office, Trump has dismantled scores of environmental rules. The U.S. has become the world's biggest oil and gas producer over the last couple of years, thanks mainly to a technology-led drilling boom. During the first round of the second Democratic presidential debate on Tuesday evening, the 2020 hopefuls on the stage all agreed on the need to urgently address climate change, but clashed over how to do it.

They can become political footballs in our eyes." <sep> On the conservation side however, I think it's a much less rosy picture," Fosburgh said. <sep> 	Hunting is down in the US. The Trump administration wants to change that Washington (CNN) Toy gun grasped firmly in his hand and a grin plastered wide across his face while he played "Big Buck Hunter Pro," Ryan Zinke could have been a kid at an arcade. But the Interior secretary and former congressman was actually in the department cafeteria showing off the arcade game installed to commemorate hunting season." To highlight #sportsmen contributions 2 conservation I installed Big Buck Hunter in the employee cafeteria. Get excited for #hunting season!" Zinke tweeted from his personal account Tuesday. But Zinke is not toying around when it comes to his support of hunters and fishers. Hunting in the United States is down. A US Fish and Wildlife Service survey released last week found that there are 2.2 million fewer hunters in America now than in 2011. And the new administration is poised to change that. On his first day in office back in March, Zinke issued two orders, one which overturned a recent ban of lead ammunition and fish tackle on Fish and Wildlife Service lands and waters. Last week Zinke issued another secretarial order designed to increase access to various public lands for hunters and fishers." What really kind of expedited this whole thing, was last week the US Fish and Wildlife put out a survey saying that hundreds of Americans were enjoying the outdoors, but within that survey they found that hunting was down," Heather Swift, Interior spokesperson said when asked about last week's secretarial order. "And the big thing that the secretary hears over and over again is that people just don't have access to land." Mr. Zinke was the pick of the litter, not the best litter ever, but he was definitely the pick and that's why we advocated for him and that's why Jr. advocated for him as well," said Land Tawney, the president of the Montana-based Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a non-profit sportsmen's organization. Zinke and the Interior have recently made a big show of their support of hunting groups. In addition to the "Buck Hunter" game he gifted Interior employees, the department declared Thursday that October would be National Hunting and Fishing Month. The declaration also generated the support of the National Rifle Association." Hunters, anglers, and target shooters are the best conservationists who contribute so much through the Pittman-Robertson and Dingell-Johnson Acts," said Richard Childress, NRA vice president. "Last year, they contributed $1.2 billion toward conservation and protecting our natural resources. We need more mentors taking young people out and teaching them to hunt and fish, so I'm glad Secretary Zinke is promoting hunting and fishing at the federal level." With what's leaked it's super troubling. Any reduction on these monuments is an attack on the Antiquities Act," said Tawney. "All monuments are at risk now. They can become political footballs in our eyes." Conservationists who want to expand their access to hunting on public park lands and at monuments are as weary of opening up national park land to fossil fuel industries as environmentalists are, since both value sustaining the land as is." We can have all the access we want to a concrete parking lot, but that access doesn't mean anything if that fish and wildlife habitat isn't there," said Tawney. Another pro-hunting group says what they are seeing within Interior is a fight between access and conservation." On the access front the department has been good. Access to our own public lands is a lot harder today than it ever has been, and that is in part introduced with the decline in hunting numbers we've seen," said Whit Fosburgh, president and CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, a non-profit coalition of conservation organizations and outdoor related businesses." On the conservation side however, I think it's a much less rosy picture," Fosburgh said. "It's been a lot more about expanding development, opening up to oil and gas. There has been no proactive conservation vision espoused for our public lands." Fosburgh said that the hunting community started getting "a little bit critical" of Zinke after he first announced the National Monument Review earlier this year. And he's skeptical of just how far the secretarial order will go." They use hunting and fishing for an excuse for our changes in monuments," he said. "All of the ones under review already allow hunting and fishing very clearly." Fosberg's criticism is similar to what environmental groups said following the secretarial order last week." Don't be fooled: the Trump Administration is pretending to be granting hunting and fishing rights that are already guaranteed by law and policy," said a statement from the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning thing tank. "The real story is that, with this announcement, the Trump administration is trying to create a distraction from their plans to dramatically reduce the size of America's national monuments, which would be the largest elimination of protections on wildlife habitat in US history." Nevertheless, Fosburgh said most pro-hunting and conservation minded groups are still hoping for the best with the Trump administration." We're very prepared, and we have been from day one. We supported his nomination and we are prepared to work with Secretary Zinke," he said. "We're not going to just say it's a lost cause in September of the first year of the administration."	True

However, Lengyel waffled on humanity's role in shaping the climate behind these storms.	For its part, the military has been blunt about the risks posed by climate change, describing it as a "threat multiplier."	"I believe the climate is changing.	"The flight line is devastated. <sep> The effects of a changing climate … will impact our security situation," said Defense Secretary James Mattis during his confirmation hearing. <sep> 	Hurricane Michael showed how woefully unprepared the military is for extreme weather Hurricane Michael roared through the Florida Panhandle last week with 155 mph winds and a storm surge that reached 14 feet, killing at least 18 people in four states, destroying homes, and knocking down power lines serving millions of customers. Tyndall Air Force Base near Panama City, Florida, took a direct hit and suffered heavy damage. "The flight line is devastated. Every building has severe damage. Many buildings are a complete loss," according to the base's most recent storm damage update. Of particular concern were the base's F-22 Raptor aircraft, the most sophisticated fighter jet in the Air Force's arsenal. The stealth fighters cost $377 million apiece (if you include research and development costs), and the Air Force has 183 of them in its inventory. Tyndall is home to 55 of those F-22s. The New York Times reported that 33 of the Raptors were sent to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, leaving several of the highly valuable aircraft in the path of the storm. A spokesperson for the Air Force declined to give any tallies for damaged aircraft at Tyndall, saying that crews are still assessing the scale of the damage. However, photos taken by passers-by show several F-22s in damaged hangars. We don't yet know the full extent of the damage across Tyndall or to the F-22s in particular. Reports now indicate that most of the F-22 aircraft that remained at Tyndall survived the storm intact and with repairable damage. But the fact that expensive hardware was housed in exposed structures on the Gulf Coast illustrates how vulnerable the military is to extreme weather, especially as storms like hurricanes gain a boost from climate change. It also shows that the military is on the front lines of the consequences of rising temperatures. Conflicts exacerbated by drought, heat, and storms are a major concern for defense planners. Military installations themselves are also at risk: At least 128 bases face inundation from sea level rise. With billions of dollars of assets in harm's way and more weather extremes on the horizon, making and enacting disaster plans are becoming all the more critical for the military. While Hurricane Michael was the first Category 4 storm to make landfall in the Florida Panhandle on record, major hurricanes have struck the region in the past. Tyndall Air Force Base spans more than 29,000 acres and is home to almost 4,000 active military personnel. Officials say that base staff and their families were evacuated ahead of the storm, and since Michael passed, no fatalities or injuries were reported. But the base's runways sit adjacent to barrier islands (including the aptly named "Hurricane Island") and were particularly at risk for damage from extreme weather. A hangar on the base even served as a refuge for other Raptors in May as Subtropical Storm Alberto hit the region. Tyler Rogoway at The Drive wrote a compelling explanation for why all the valuable aircraft weren't simply flown out of harm's way:At modern fighter is not a Honda Accord. You don't just hop in it and drive it around for months until you finally have to take it for a one-hour oil change when the light comes on. If anything, they are far more akin to high-end sports cars that require a lot of expensive TLC to keep operating. The F-22, in particular, is more analogous to an exotic supercar or even a high-end race car than anything else. It requires dozens of hours of maintenance for every single flight hour and deep maintenance can take days or even many weeks to accomplish, depending on what is needed to be done and availability of spare parts, which can be scarce. The aircraft that weren't removed were likely undergoing maintenance and couldn't be readied in time for transportation, especially given that Hurricane Michael gained strength so fast. However, given that there are so few F-22s overall (the Air Force has more than 400 F-15s and more than 1,000 F-16s) and that Raptors are no longer being manufactured, each lost or damaged F-22 presents a large loss of capability. The coastal bases that house sensitive equipment like F-22s also face hazards, particularly from extreme weather. As climate change pushes average temperatures up, the raw ingredients of hurricanes — water temperature and air temperature — also intensify. Water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico were 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit higher than is typical this time of year. Michael's rapid ramp-up also comports with what scientists expect from global warming. "As the climate continues to warm, hurricanes may intensify more rapidly just before striking land, making hurricane forecasting more difficult," wrote Massachusetts Institute of Technology climate scientist Kerry Emanuel in a 2017 paper in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. For its part, the military has been blunt about the risks posed by climate change, describing it as a "threat multiplier." The effects of a changing climate … will impact our security situation," said Defense Secretary James Mattis during his confirmation hearing. The military assembled an adaptation roadmap in 2014, chalking out how they plan to contend with climate change. Plans include raising coastal infrastructure, protecting vulnerable supply chains, and increasing disaster training. And the head of the National Guard, Air Force Gen. Joseph Lengyel, told Vox's Alex Ward last week, "There's a lot of storms coming our way. Whatever the reason, we have to be ready to deal with them." However, Lengyel waffled on humanity's role in shaping the climate behind these storms. "I believe the climate is changing. I don't know why," he said. However, as Hurricane Michael showed, there's a vast gulf between acknowledging climate change and adequately preparing for it. Either there was a plan in place to deal with an unprecedented storm at Tyndall and it wasn't followed, or there wasn't one, and we're already seeing the consequences.	False

If you have a view on what you want to happen, we'll carry it out when you execute it. That is my position." Bernhardt, a former oil and gas lobbyist who was confirmed as agency secretary last month, told the subcommittee that he recognizes that the climate is changing, that human beings are "a contributing factor" and that the agency is taking the threat into account in its decision-making.A pair of dire reports released last year, one from the United Nations and another from more than a dozen federal U.S. agencies, warned that world governments are running out of time to stave off catastrophic climate change. Still, the Trump administration has barreled ahead with its fossil fuel-centric "energy dominance" agenda. Approximately one-quarter of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions come from fossil fuel extraction on federal lands, according to a government report released by the Trump administration in November. Bernhardt, who brought with him to the job a slew of potential conflicts of interest from his days as an energy lobbyist, also faced tough questions Tuesday about alleged ethics violations.

Markey is expected to join Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez this week in releasing expanded language on the high-level goals of a Green New Deal.

"Furthermore, the scientists tell us we have a very short, 12 years, not a lot of time in order to transform our energy system away from fossil fuels."

Trump signs executive orders making it tougher for states to block pipeline construction President Trump on Wednesday signed two executive orders that will make it harder for states to block the construction of oil and gas pipelines and other energy projects due to environmental concerns. Coming on the heels of officials in Washington state and New York using permitting processes to stop new energy projects in recent years – and at the urging of some industry leaders – Trump's executive order will speed up the construction of oil and gas pipelines across the country." y action today will cut through the destructive permitting and denials," Trump said during the signing of the executive orders at the International Union of Operating Engineers International Training and Education Center, a union-run facility in Crosby, Texas. "Under this administration, we've ended the war on American energy." It will take no more than 60 days," Trump said of the approval process for new pipelines, "and the president, not the bureaucracy, will make the final decision." While the move was greeted warmly by members of the country's oil and gas industries, it is likely to rankle some more traditional conservative lawmakers – including several Republican governors - worried about the federal government impinging on individual state rights and governance. The White House has sought to stave off any discord by arguing that the order is not meant to take power away from the states, but to ensure that state actions follow the intent of the Clean Water Act. Trade groups representing the oil and gas industry applauded the orders and said greater access to natural gas benefits families and the environment." When states say 'no' to the development of natural gas pipelines, they force utilities to curb safe and affordable service and refuse access to new customers, including new businesses," said Karen Harbert, president and CEO at the American Gas Association. Trump's move comes less than a week after nearly a dozen business groups told EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler that the environmental review and permitting process for energy infrastructure projects "has become a target for environmental activists and states that oppose the production and use of fossil fuels." The groups said in an April 5 letter that individual states shouldn't be able to use provisions of the Clear Air Act "to dictate national policy, thereby harming other states and the national interest and damaging cooperative federalism." Washington state blocked the building of a coal terminal in 2017, saying there were too many major harmful impacts including air pollution, rail safety and vehicle traffic. New York regulators stopped a natural gas pipeline, saying it failed to meet standards to protect streams, wetlands and other water resources. Under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, companies must get certification from the state before moving ahead with an energy project. One of Trump's planned executive orders calls for the Environmental Protection Agency to consult with states, tribes and others before issuing new guidance and rules for states on how to comply with the law. Environmental groups described Trump's order as an effort to short-circuit a state's ability to review complicated projects, putting at risk a state's ability to protect drinking water supplies and wildlife." The Trump Administration's proposal would trample on state authority to protect waters within their own borders," said Jim Murphy, senior counsel for the National Wildlife Federation. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe private Center for Biological Diversity said Wednesday's actions would mark the fourth time Trump has used executive orders to streamline permits for fossil-fuel infrastructure." Trump's developing an addiction to executive orders that rubberstamp these climate-killing projects," said Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the center. The second executive order Trump signed on Wednesday streamlines the process for energy infrastructure that crosses international borders. Currently, the secretary of state has the authority to issue permits for cross-border infrastructure such as pipelines. The executive order clarifies that the president will make the decision on whether to issue such permits. The move follows Trump's decision last month to issue a new presidential permit for the long-stalled Keystone XL oil pipeline — two years after he first approved it and more than a decade after it was first proposed.

(AP) — A federal judge ruled Wednesday that the Dakota Access oil pipeline can continue operating while a study is completed to assess its environmental impact on an American Indian tribe.U.S. District Judge James Boasberg's decision will come as a blow to the Standing Rock Sioux, who have argued that an oil spill from the pipeline under Lake Oahe — from which the tribe draws its water — could have a detrimental effect on the tribal community." oday's decision is a disappointing continuation of a historic pattern: Other people get all the profits, and the tribes get all the risk and harm," said Jan Hasselman, an Earthjustice attorney representing the tribe in an ongoing federal lawsuit through which Standing Rock and three other tribes still hope to shut down the pipeline. Boasberg found that it is likely the Army Corps of Engineers will be able to justify previous decisions made while permitting the pipeline." he Corps must simply connect the dots," he said. "This, then, is not a case in which the agency must redo its analysis from the ground up." Boasberg also acknowledged that shutting down the pipeline would disrupt the energy industry, but said it wasn't a major factor in his decision. The $3.8 billion pipeline built by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners has been operating since June 1, moving oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a distribution point in Illinois. From there it can be shipped to the Gulf Coast and potentially lucrative markets abroad. It has the capacity to move half of the oil produced daily in North Dakota, the nation's second-leading producer behind Texas. Energy industry officials applauded Boasberg's ruling, with North Dakota Petroleum Council President Ron Ness calling the pipeline "a critical part of American energy infrastructure." The Justice Department declined comment on behalf of the Corps. President Donald Trump had pushed for the pipeline's completion, and the Corps dropped a plan to conduct more environmental study after he took office. Boasberg ruled on June 14 that the Corps largely complied with environmental law, but he ordered the agency to reconsider certain areas of its analysis, and took arguments on whether to shut down the 1,200-mile (1,930-kilometer) pipeline while the work is done. Boasberg in June said the Corps didn't adequately consider how an oil spill under the Lake Oahe reservoir on the Missouri River in the Dakotas might affect the Standing Rock Sioux. The tribe is among four that have challenged the pipeline in court over environmental fears that ETP says are unfounded. The judge said the Corps also didn't adequately study how the pipeline might disproportionately affect the tribal community — a concept known as environmental justice. That aims to ensure development projects aren't built in areas where minority populations might not have the resources to defend their rights. In its analysis of the Missouri River crossing, the Corps studied the mostly white demographics in a half-mile (0.8-kilometer) radius, which the agency maintains is standard. But if the agency had gone an additional 88 yards (80 meters) — about the length of a football field — the study would have included the Standing Rock Reservation. Boasberg in his ruling Wednesday said that issue was "a closer call" than the others, but that it still did not justify shutting down the pipeline. He noted that the tribe's water intake has been moved about 50 miles (80 kilometers) downstream since pipeline construction began, and said an alternative river crossing near Bismarck that had been studied and rejected would pass much closer to a drinking water intake that serve tens of thousands more people." isks presented to this tenfold increase in population must, of course, be considered," the judge said. Corps attorneys said the agency expects to be able by next spring to substantiate its earlier determination that the pipeline poses no significant environmental threats. ETP maintained that a shutdown would cost it $90 million monthly and significantly disrupt the broader energy industry as well as state and local tax revenue. The North Dakota Pipeline Authority this week said that the Dakota Access pipeline boosted the state's tax revenues by about $19 million in its first three months of operation. Tribal attorneys argued that ETP had overstated the potential effects of a shutdown, and Boasberg acknowledged "some cause for skepticism" regarding ETP's predictions. Tribal attorneys also said a shutdown would create incentive for the Corps to take the review seriously. The tribes had proposed a fallback plan if Boasberg decided against a shutdown. It includes increased public reporting of pipeline issues such as repairs, and implementation of a spill response plan — including equipment staging — at Lake Oahe. Boasberg said he will hear arguments on the matter. He scheduled a status conference for Oct. 18.	True

EPA Considers Repealing Another Obama-Era Coal Regulation Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt told business advocates the agency will reconsider a rule utilities worry could force more coal-fired power plants to close."  have decided that it is appropriate and in the public interest to reconsider the rule," Pruitt wrote in a letter sent Wednesday to counsel for a utility group and officials at the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA)." he EPA is acting promptly to issue an administrative stay of the compliance dates in the rule that have not yet passed pending judicial review," Pruitt wrote regarding an EPA regulation on liquid waste from coal plants. Pruitt was responding to a petition sent by the Utility Water Action Group (UWAG), urging the Trump administration to rescind its "Effluent Limitations Guidelines" for coal-fired power plants. UWAG argues the regulation will "cause negative impacts on jobs due to the excessive costs of compliance – which were grossly underestimated by EPA – and regulatory burdens forcing plant closures." UWAG said EPA underestimated the rule's costs and withheld records about the rulemaking from utilities who would have to comply with the rule, which the agency estimates could cost up to $2.5 billion a year." o an unprecedented extent, the Agency withheld fundamental information purporting to justify the Rule, UWAG argued, adding that included "pages of the record that demonstrably were not entitled to confidential treatment." The EPA said in legal filings it withheld records to protect confidential business information. Pruitt said EPA would reconsider the ELG rule based on UWAG's concerns. It's the latest move by the Trump administration to ease the regulatory burden on the coal industry. President Donald Trump promised to lessen regulations on coal mines to put miners back to work. Trump has already signed executive orders to rescind EPA and Interior Department regulations on coal production and power generation. Most recently, Trump ordered the EPA to review the Clean Power Plan, which limits carbon dioxide emissions from new and existing power plants. That rule was also expected to force more coal plants to prematurely shut down. Environmentalists were, obviously, outraged by Pruitt's decision." rump's attempt to halt these clean water protections for mercury, lead, and arsenic from coal power plants is dangerous and irresponsible," said Mary Anne Hitt, the director of the Sierra Club's "Beyond Coal" campaign. The Obama administration finalized the ELG rule in 2015 and it went into effect in January 2016. The rule requires coal plants to install new equipment to curb pollution from wastewater streams. Utilities, including UWAG, took EPA to court to have the rule overturned. UWAG and others argued the rule violated the Clean Water Act and Administrative Procedures Act. Aside from arguing EPA improperly withheld data on how they came up with the rule, plaintiffs argued the agency didn't perform proper testing to see if requiring coal plants to install new equipment would meet federal pollution guidelines. Environmentalists fought to keep the rule in place, and Pruitt can expect legal challenges if EPA tries to repeal the ELG rule." rump claimed he wanted EPA to go 'back to basics' and focus on clean air and water in his Administration, but one of the first actions by his EPA Administrator is an attempt to gut an important water pollution safeguard," Hitt said.

The LA Times Inadvertently Admits Trump Is Right About What's Causing California's Massive Wildfires Adopting more active forest management policies such as increased thinning of trees and conducting controlled burns will help mitigate damage from future wildfires, the Los Angeles Times editorial board writes. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke began advocating similar policy prescriptions earlier in 2018 after President Donald Trump blamed California's "bad environmental laws" for creating a wildfire-prone environment. (RELATED: Trump Administration Is Taking Its Fight Against 'Bad Environmental Laws' Straight To California)California forests have grown drier and less healthy from overcrowded trees, infestations of bark beetles and the effects of climate change, the LA Times writes. California's restrictions on active forest management have contributed to the poor and worsening conditions of the forests, allowing them to grow uninhibited while suppressing fires that would normally naturally control the forests' growth." ire is not necessarily bad for forests. California used to burn with regularity, and low-intensity fires are vital in some ecosystems to clear excess brush and small trees from the landscape," the editorial board writes. "But there's been a change in fire behavior over the last century, as the state and federal government began dousing the blazes. Decades of fire suppression have allowed forests to grow dense with trees." Combined with drought, insect infestations and the stress of a warming climate, those management practices have led to more intense and destructive fires that are more dangerous to people living near the forests and more damaging to air quality," the op-ed continues. California's environmental laws entered the national spotlight in early August when Trump blamed them for the severity of the wildfires that were ravaging the state. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke was soon at the front of the administration's push for California to begin adopting more active land management policies. Zinke traveled to California to see the damage from the fires and meet with local officials and firefighters Aug. 13. Zinke ramped up calls for greater forest thinning while also dismissing the idea that climate change is playing a significant factor in the wildfires' intensity.

U.S. report says climate change will batter economy, in clash with Trump (Reuters) – Climate change will cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century, damaging everything from human health to infrastructure and agricultural production, according to a government report issued on Friday. The Congressionally-mandated report, written with the help of more than a dozen U.S. government agencies and departments, outlined the projected impacts of global warming in every corner of American society, in a dire warning at odds with the Trump administration's pro-fossil fuels agenda." ith continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century – more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many U.S. states," according to the report. It said global warming would disproportionately hurt the poor, broadly undermine human health, damage infrastructure, limit the availability of water, alter coastlines, and boost costs in industries from farming to energy production. While it said that many of the impacts of climate change – including more frequent and more powerful storms, droughts and flooding – are already underway, the projections of further damage could change if greenhouse gas emissions are sharply curbed: "Future risks from climate change depend primarily on decisions made today," it said. The report, the Fourth National Climate Assessment Volume II, supplements a study issued last year that concluded humans are the main driver of global warming, and which warned of potentially catastrophic effects to the planet. The studies clash with policy under President Donald Trump, who has been rolling back Obama-era environmental and climate protections to maximize production of domestic fossil fuels, including crude oil, already the highest in the world, above Saudi Arabia and Russia. Trump last year announced his intention to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris Deal agreed by nearly 200 nations to combat climate change, arguing the accord would hurt the U.S. economy and provide little tangible environmental benefit. Trump and several members of his cabinet have also repeatedly cast doubt on the science of climate change, arguing the causes and impacts are not yet settled. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Environmental groups said the report reinforced their calls for the United States to take action on climate change." his report makes it clear that climate change is not some problem in the distant future. It's happening right now in every part of the country," said Brenda Ekwurzel, the director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists and one of the report's authors. Previous research, including from U.S. government scientists, has also concluded that climate change could have severe economic consequences, including damage to infrastructure, water supplies and agriculture. Severe weather and other impacts also increase the risk of disease transmission, decrease air quality, and can increase mental health problems, among other effects.

Democrats won the House in November riding a platform that included a call to address the crisis. Global warming was blamed for intensifying natural disasters that killed dozens and cost billions of dollars across the country in 2018. A recent avalanche of evidence that the climate is already changing radically has hardened the case for immediate action." Climate change is here and now. And palpably getting worse. That is rapidly changing how Americans think about it," David Doniger with the Natural Resources Defense Council wrote in a recent blog. "The shift from 'future problem' to 'now crisis' is being fueled by blockbuster scientific reports and blockbuster real-world catastrophes." And yet few – including Doniger – expect Washington to do much any time soon in the dramatic way scientists are urging. President Donald Trump, who in 2017 yanked the U.S. out of the Paris Accord on climate change, continues to doubt the science and says radical action would only hurt the economy. At an international climate conference in Poland in December, his emissaries doubled down on the expansion of fossil fuels, notably coal. And while incoming House Democratic leaders vow to make climate change a priority when they take control Thursday, their most ambitious proposals are expected to die in the GOP-controlled Senate, where Republicans remain resistant to far-reaching steps aimed at weaning the nation off carbon. So for Democrats and their environmental allies, the next two years in Washington are likely to be more about making a case to voters than actually scoring significant victories on climate change, said Bob Shrum, a longtime Democratic strategist who teaches political science at the University of Southern California."I don't think Trump's going to give an inch on this," he said. "I think we'll be at a stalemate (for the next two years). But I think Democrats can prepare the ground, can win the argument and can go into 2020 on these issues in a pretty strong position." Studies suggest there isn't much time for politicking on the issue. Some of the effects are already taking place, according to a landmark climate assessment the administration released in November. Climate change is contributing to extreme weather conditions,  the spread of new diseases by insects and pests and changes to the availability of food and water, the researchers say. But the dire warning has done little to prod Capitol Hill Republicans, many of whom still question the science behind climate change. Reluctant to cross Trump, they barely discuss the issue these days compared to three years ago, according to an analysis of press releases, floor statements, tweets and Facebook posts by software firm Quorom. When Republicans do talk about it, the refrain is that innovation and incentive alone can solve the issue. One of the most notable achievements they tout was passage of a tax credit to encourage the capture and storage of carbon emissions into the ground before they become airborne and contribute to global warming. More: El Niños to strengthen because of global warming, will cause 'more extreme weather', study saysMore: Emissions of carbon dioxide into Earth's atmosphere reach record highBut they roundly oppose dramatic steps, such as a carbon tax, to cut the nation off fossil fuels because it would increase the cost of energy. Wyoming GOP Sen. John Barrasso, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and a sponsor of the carbon capture legislation, opposes such "punishing regulations." Making energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, without raising costs to consumers will be accomplished through investment, invention and innovation," Barrasso wrote in a column for The New York Times. With carbon capture, clean energy development and other advances, the reliance on fossil fuels must stop as well if the planet has any hope of meeting the net-zero carbon emissions goal by 2050 that scientists cite as a minimum to stave off the worst effects of a warming globe." That's a one-two punch we need to solve the climate crisis," said Conrad Schneider, advocacy Director for the Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit organization pushing for carbon emission reduction. "Neither alone is going to get it done." One of the few congressional Republicans willing to support a carbon tax is Florida Rep. Francis Rooney. Representing one of the country's reddest districts, the former businessman from Oklahoma is a pro-Trump conservative on most issues. But on climate change, he is is an unflinching opponent, largely because rising sea levels threaten his home state."I don't think we need to burn coal," Rooney said. "A carbon tax is the most market-oriented, nonbureaucratic, efficient way I can see to kill off coal." And Rooney said the intransigence most of his fellow Republicans, including President Trump, display on the issue is harmful to the GOP brand – and could come back to haunt them in 2020." We need to be reaching out to broaden our base, and if you look at this last election, our base is narrowing unfortunately," he said. "I talk to our kids and young people all the time, and they are more environmentally sensitive, they're more pro-alternative energy, they get the natural gas thing instead of coal." Tom Steyer, the liberal California billionaire who is mulling a presidential run in 2020, believes climate change – and Republicans' refusal to follow experts' advice despite the dire warnings – will help Democrats sweep into office two years from now." When we talk about what's at stake here, we're talking about unimaginable suffering by the American people unless we solve the problem over the next 12 years," he said recently. " And I think that we're very far from doing that. And it is unclear to me that we can summon that will without having substantial political victories across the board."	True

But what's largely been lost in the conversation is how much the attempt to repeal the regulation on carbon dioxide emissions will impact people's health.		Trump's war on climate policy is also a war on public health Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt is expected to sign a proposed rule on Tuesday that would roll back a key piece of President Obama's climate legacy. But what's largely been lost in the conversation is how much the attempt to repeal the regulation on carbon dioxide emissions will impact people's health. Pruitt wants to repeal Obama's Clean Power Plan, the signature Environmental Protection Agency policy that aims to cut emissions from existing US power plants — a big driver of climate change — 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. While the big focus of the plan was reducing carbon emissions, it also aimed to keep hundreds of thousands of tons of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution out of the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases are not only harmful to the environment but also increase the risk of everything from asthma to heart disease. The Clean Power Plan, in other words, though never implemented, was a big win for health. According to the EPA, cutting exposure to particle pollution in the order the CPP does would have averted up to 3,600 premature deaths, 90,000 asthma attacks in children, and 1,700 heart attacks each year. Which means that the White House's move to repeal the Clean Power Plan "is a one-two punch to human health and the environment," said Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. "Greenhouse gases are an enormous risk to human health. So this means we'll continue to be exposed to these gases, which exacerbate asthma, heart disease, strokes." According to the Global Burden of Disease project, more than 5 million people die worldwide each year because of air pollution — and emissions from coal-fired plants are a major risk factor here. It's one reason why health experts have been pushing policymakers to rapidly phase out of coal. For miners, the immediate health risks include black lung disease and scarring of the lung tissue. But the pollutants emitted when coal is processed — including sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and mercury — have much more far-reaching effects on many more people. In one large study involving 450,000 Americans followed between 1982 and 2004, researchers found that increased exposure to the particles in fossil fuel emissions increased the risk of death from heart disease — and particles from coal burning were five times more damaging than other similar particles. Reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants also makes it easier to breathe. Over the past 30 years, the percentage of Americans with asthma has more than doubled, and climate change has been a significant driver of that trend. Air pollution triggers asthma attacks, contributing to lung abnormalities, particularly in the developing pulmonary systems of children. For the White House, bolstering the coal industry seems to trump these other matters. "The war on coal is over," Pruitt said Monday in Kentucky when he announced the move. For now, the environmental community and some state governments are expected to oppose the rule in federal courts. The public health community should be there too. Health isn't a big part of the conversation about Trump administration assault on climate change mitigation policies but it needs to be. It's not just the future of the planet that's at stake here.

In the past three days, four more candidates—including Kamala Harris—have told Mother Jones that they support a climate debate, raising the stakes for the Democratic National Committee, which has so far resisted allowing such an event to take place. In addition to the California senator, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Rep. John Delaney (Md.), and former Rep. Joe Sestak (Pa.) are now calling for a climate debate, joining big-name candidates including Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, and Elizabeth Warren. Earlier this year, the DNC announced plans to hold a dozen primary debates in 2019 and 2020 and to prohibit candidates from appearing in any debates that had not been approved by the national party. In April, climate activists launched a grassroots campaign demanding that one of the debates be dedicated to climate; they noted that presidential debate moderators had a long history of giving short shrift to the issue. It's not just because activists want to vet candidate platforms and solutions, but because even getting candidates to talk more about an issue can raise the issue's profile. The activists quickly won support from Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who has put global warming at the center of his campaign. But the DNC's line all along has been that it wouldn't hold any issue-specific debates. The controversy reemerged after the first round of Democratic debates last week. Climate received 15 minutes of discussion over two nights, but the largely superficial discussion of the issue only seemed to strengthen the activists' case, as key policy proposals such as the Green New Deal and 100 percent renewable energy mandates were virtually ignored. DNC officials spent the weekend reconsidering the matter. The result was a pair of resolutions that could come up for a vote at the party's August meeting. One proposal, backed by DNC executive committee member Christine Pelosi and others, would create a climate debate.

If a climate debate does happen, much of the credit will belong to activist organizations like the US Youth Climate Strike, a teen-led group that has pressured candidates into endorsing the efforts. They plan to join with another youth-oriented group, Sunrise Movement, to keep up the pressure throughout the summer. Still, six candidates either haven't taken a position on a climate change debate or didn't respond to requests for comment in time for publication. They are Sen. Cory Booker, who called for more time to be devoted to the issue after the first debate; Montana Gov. Steve Bullock; former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper; Wayne Messam, the mayor of Miramar, Florida; California Rep. Eric Swalwell; and author Marianne Williamson. Here's what each of the candidates have said:Biden addressed a Greenpeace activist at a campaign rally in Ottumwa, Iowa, on June 11: "That's what we should be doing," he said. "I'm all in, man. Take a look at what I'm talking about—and by the way, the first climate change plan in the history of the Congress?" The campaign confirmed his position to Mother Jones in July. He tweeted in response to a Youth Climate Strike activist:The candidate tweeted a video of her reading a letter from an activist asking her to sign a petition for a climate change debate. "I'm up for that," she said. She also backed Inslee's pushback against the DNC:Harris' communications director told Mother Jones, "She's said she is happy to debate." Harris previously hadn't said publicly that she supports a climate change debate. Buttigieg's campaign did not clarify the candidate's position on a debate, but a staffer says he "plans to continue to address the issue of climate change at every debate and every event that he attends."O'Rourke's campaign did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication to confirm Youth Climate Strike's tweet:Booker supports more climate change discussion, but the campaign told Mother Jones that the decision is in the hands of the DNC." ohn supports having a climate debate," his communications director wrote in a July 1 email. "Climate has been a big part of our campaign and we mentioned our carbon fee and dividend plan during the debate last week." A DNC debate focused on climate change would show the world that America intends to lead again on this issue, and would be a smart place to discuss the key tenets of the Green New Deal—infrastructure, green jobs and clean air and water—and how to put a price on carbon," she told the Daily Beast. Bennet told Politico he thought a climate debate would be "great." Inslee was the first candidate to endorse a climate change debate, on April 17, launching his own petition aimed at the DNC. "I cannot rule out any other debate that would highlight both the necessity of defeating the climate crisis and calling for the candidates to step up to the plate," Inslee said in an interview with Mother Jones. "Sixty-second sound bites, which is all you'll be able to get in a party debate, is grossly inadequate to the task." The candidate wrote on Wednesday in an email to Mother Jones, "How could you not? It is the most destructive threat to America and mankind."	True

The focus for young activists is the United Nations Climate Action Summit taking place Monday in New York City. The strike's figurehead is 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, who traveled from Sweden to New York on an emission-free sailboat. A little over a year ago Thunberg began her school strike for the climate, by herself, outside the Swedish Parliament. Support for a school climate strike has since spread across the globe. In the last year Thunberg has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by Norwegian lawmakers. She's also met with Pope Francis and lawmakers in several countries." We are currently on track for a world that could displace billions of people from their homes," Thunberg warned this week during a speech accepting Amnesty International's Ambassador of Conscience Award. She ended her acceptance speech with a call to action: "See you on the streets!"In New York City thousands of students may fill the streets with Thunberg because, as the school district announced on Twitter, it is giving strikers excused absences. In Oregon Portland Public Schools is doing the same. Strikes also are planned in rural areas where just a few dozen protesters are expected.

There have been similar student events in the past year. But this time students are asking adults to join them. At the University of Nevada, Reno, Stallar Lufrano-Jardine, 36, is setting up an event on campus where she's an employee and student."I'm bothered by the lack of movement to make meaningful advances to solve the climate crisis," says Lufrano-Jardine. But it's clear younger people are leading this movement and they say most adults — especially policy-makers — are moving far too slowly. Strike organizers have a list of demands that includes "respect of indigenous land, sustainable agriculture, protecting biodiversity, environmental justice and a just transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy," said 17-year-old Baltimore resident and organizer Nadia Nazar. Many of those demands are part of the Green New Deal, which was crafted by progressive Democratic lawmakers but so far hasn't gone anywhere in Congress. At a Capitol Hill press event this week Nazar said she hopes the proposal defines her generation. "I am not a part of Generation Z. I am a part of Gen GND — the generation of the Green New Deal," said Nazar as supporters cheered. Also on Capitol Hill this week, Thunberg and other activists testified before lawmakers. Louisiana Republican Rep. Garret Graves told them climate change has exacerbated the loss of his state's coastline."I agree that we need to take aggressive action. I agree that we need to ensure that we move forward in a sustainable, rational manner," said Graves. But his idea of what that means is very different than the activists' vision. Graves agrees with President Trump on the need to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. Graves told the student organizers the pact allows China to continue emitting more carbon dioxide while the U.S. cuts emissions. "Paris and its related pledges would undermine U.S. competitiveness," his spokesman said. Graves got immediate push-back from the young activists, including 17-year-old Jamie Margolin from Seattle who asked how Graves will respond to questions from his children and grandchildren about whether he did enough to address climate change." Can you really look them in the eye and say, 'No, sorry, I couldn't do anything because that country over there didn't do anything, so if they're not going to do it then I'm not.' That is shameful and that is cowardly," Margolin said. Organizers predict this climate strike will be the largest yet. More than 2000 scientists around the world have pledged to join. Some companies also have signed on, including Patagonia and Seventh Generation.	True

Oh Mores! Over the last two weeks we've heard a lot of folderol and bambosh about Republicans, conservatives, Texans — etc. — not "believing" in science because recent hurricanes have been bad and climate change is causing it and blah blah blah. As you can probably tell, I don't think much of all that. We had a historic lull in hurricanes until the lull was over. Once the hurricanes started back up, so did the claim that climate change caused the hurricanes just as the scientists predicted — the same scientists who didn't predict the lull. Similarly, California had a historic drought that recently came to an end. Most of the climate models say that California should get wetter because of global warming. But that didn't stop President Obama and others from suggesting the dry spell was a symptom of climate change. Then, when California experienced huge amounts of precipitation, suddenly the models were prescient. But look: I don't want to debate global warming because a) it's boring to me, b) you get screamed at by people who act like we have seconds to act before the world ends, and c) you — or at least I — also get screamed at by people who insist it's all a complete hoax. For those interested, I'm basically in the Matt Ridley "lukewarmer"camp. Now, back to my point. This whole "don't believe in science" canard amounts to ackamarackus bordering on flimflam. Even if you were a 100 percent "denier" of climate change, that wouldn't necessarily mean you don't "believe" in science. Indeed, many of the hardcore rejectionists I know are really, really, really into the science of climate change (tell the guys at CEI they don't believe in science, I dare you). They just tend to think the prevailing "consensus" is a politically and journalistically contrived sham. But even if you are a "denier" without being a science dork, that doesn't necessarily mean you don't believe in "science." Rejecting one scientific finding — whether accurate or inaccurate — doesn't mean you must reject all "science," never mind suggest that you don't "believe" in it. To be honest, I don't know what people who say "you don't believe in science" think they mean when they say it. Climate "deniers" don't insist the world is flat (though I have to assume flat-earthers have unconventional views on atmospheric science). They don't refuse to take medical treatment or prescribed drugs. They have faith that the internal-combustion engine is based on sound science. Etc. Often, when I stupidly engage people who sincerely claim that Republicans or conservatives don't "believe in science," I like to point out that many liberals and leftists have problems with science, too. People who want to ban golden rice or other GMOs; people who deny that a fetus is a whole human; people who insist fetal pain is a myth; people who get outraged by claims that, say, men can't get pregnant. The list goes on and on. And yet, I don't argue that "Democrats don't believe in science." You know why? Because that would be stupid. Anyway, what brought all this to mind was a story in the Washington Post this morning. Apparently, researchers claim they can tell whether you're a homosexual or lesbian by using facial-recognition software. The results aren't perfect, they claim, but the computers apparently do better than humans at guessing which team you play for — or secretly want to play for but don't. Not surprisingly, gay-rights groups are angry! They don't like it! And, to be honest, I can understand why. But that's not the point. Both GLAAD and Human Rights Watch can't seem to decide whether the science is bad because it's fake and flawed or bad because it might work. A representative of GLAAD said something interesting: "Technology cannot identify someone's sexual orientation." Wait a second. Who says? Maybe this effort isn't up to snuff yet. But saying that technology can never identify someone's sexual orientation strikes me as pretty anti-sciencey, unless we're now back to saying sexual orientation is a choice, which opens a whole new kettle of fish. Anyway, I'm not sure what I think about this technology or its ramifications, but I have no problem with the notion that science will be able to figure out these things (and we'll probably find out that some things are wired, some are a choice, and most are a mix of the two). The point is that opponents don't like this science because of the political and social consequences of it. Maybe there's a parallel here with some "deniers" of climate change. But only those deniers get accused of not "believing" in science.

The GOP Is Attacking a Democrat for Being Weak on Climate Change. Wait, What?! In one of South Florida's congressional districts, the party machine swept in to prop up a two-term incumbent by painting his opponent as a puppet of fossil fuel interests and "dirty coal money." The only catch? The incumbent is Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo and the party apparatus is the National Republican Congressional Committee, whose coffers this cycle contain nearly $7 million in donations from the oil and gas industry. The ad was released on Oct. 30 and immediately national environmental groups that generally align with Democrats called foul, underscoring their support of Curbelo's Democratic challenger, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell." f Curbelo had been half the climate champion he claims he is, he wouldn't be desperately seeking an ad littered with lies such as this," said Sierra Club PAC Director Sarah Burton in a statement. "But Curbelo isn't a climate champion, he's a consistent vote against clean energy, against our public lands, and in favor of fossil fuels. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell is a climate champion, and the advocate South Floridians need as they watch sea-levels rise, see beaches destroyed by red tide, and live with the increasing threat of stronger, more powerful hurricanes." Curbelo has received more than $192,000 from energy and natural resource firms, in comparison to the less than $5,000 that Mucarsel-Powell has received from the same sector of donors, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.A spokesperson for Mucarsel-Powell's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Curbelo is one of the founders of the Climate Solutions Caucus, a bipartisan group in Congress ostensibly committed to fighting global warming, but restricted in practice by the reliance of its 45 Republican members on support from oil and gas firms. While he broke ranks this summer to express his support for a carbon tax as a possible way to combat climate change, more than 30 of Curbelo's Republican colleagues on the caucus supported a symbolic measure that disavowed a carbon tax. Last December, he joined caucus members in a budget vote that would have opened up "1.5 million acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling," Mother Jones reported at the time. The latest forecast from polling aggregator FiveThirtyEight has Curbelo trailing by less than one percentage point. The super PAC Climate Hawks Vote, which supports candidates with a progressive energy agenda, has been running ads against Curbelo that point to his history of receiving donations from fossil fuel companies, including Chevron and Exxon Mobil. This cycle, his No. 1 donor has been NextEra Energy, the Florida electric utility which is one of the largest purveyors of solar and wind energy projects in the country." e sure appreciate the help from the NRCC in calling out politicians who take dirty fossil fuel money and then obstruct progress on climate change, and are looking forward to similar NRCC ads attacking every single one of their own candidates," said RL Miller, Climate Hawks Vote's political director, in a statement.

William Happer, Lover Of Carbon Dioxide, To Exit Trump Administration William Happer, the White House's most veteran climate change denier who tried unsuccessfully to establish an ad hoc panel to challenge near-universally accepted climate science, is leaving the Trump administration, according to reports from E&E News and Bloomberg.A retired Princeton physics professor with no expertise in climatology, Happer has served as President Donald Trump's deputy assistant for emerging technologies on the National Security Council since September 2018. He has long argued that the planet and humans benefit from increased carbon dioxide emissions. He has called climate science a "cult," claimed Earth is in the midst of a "CO2 famine," and said the "demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the poor Jews under Hitler." Earlier this year, Trump tapped Happer to lead a panel of fringe researchers tasked specifically with conducting "adversarial scientific peer review" of climate science ― part of the administration's relentless effort to discredit and downplay the ongoing crisis. The White House ultimately scrapped the plan, as E&E News reported in July. News of Happer's departure comes one day after the resignation of his boss, national security adviser John Bolton. It was Bolton who recruited Happer to the National Security Council and backed his effort to create an anti-science panel, according to The New York Times.

The Arctic Sea Ice Reduction since 1978 is 4 x10^6 km2  half of which is since 2016 Its true that not all the sea ice is gone yet, but much of what remains is thin enough that the light passing through it is allowing algae blooms. In many places it is cracked and subject to being broken up by storms which due to the extremes of heat and cold confronting eachother in that region have extremes of wind and wave. The Jacobshaven Glacier delivering 10% of the ice melt from Greenlands ice caps to the sea no longer flows at a glacial pace but rather is retreating at 10 km/yr with the rate of retreat increasing at an increasing rate just as with the sea ice. Instead of climate changing over millennia we are now seeing it change in ways we can observe with our own eyes in the course of a season.

As global climate change continues to unfold, the two-way links between the tropics and the poles will play key determining factors in the climatic evolution of these sensitive regions. Thus, the time is ripe for a detailed look at how the tropics and the poles are coupled climatically. This special collection of the Journal of Climate on "Connecting the Tropics to Polar Regions" grew out of a mini-conference on the same topic that was held at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in June 2014:  of the sea ice from over the ESAS allows storms to churn up the bottom sediments speeding the release of Methane. Methane releases speed up the melting of the permafrost. The permafrost stores huge amounts of methane and fresh water. We have known this since 2007."  policy briefing from the Woods Hole Research Center concludes that the IPCC doesn't adequately account for a methane warming feedbackWhile most attention has been given to carbon dioxide, it isn't the only greenhouse gas that scientists are worried about. Carbon dioxide is the most important human-emitted greenhouse gas, but methane has also increased in the atmosphere and it adds to our concerns…. As the Earth warms, and the Arctic warms especially fast, the permafrost melts and soil decomposition accelerates. Consequently, an initial warming leads to more emission, leading to more warming and more emission. It is a vicious cycle and there may be a tipping point where this self-reinforcing cycle takes over. Recently, a policy briefing from the world-leading Woods Hole Research Center has moved our understanding of this risk further through a clearly-written summary. The briefing cites two recent papers (here and here) that study the so-called permafrost carbon feedback. One of these studies makes use of projections from the most recent IPCC report to estimate that up to 205 gigatons equivalent of carbon dioxide could be released due to melting permafrost. This would cause up to 0.5°C (up to 0.9°F) extra warming." Arctic scientists warn that the release of the methane from the ESAS could happen with the same surprising acceleration we see with glaciers, sea ice and the polar ice caps melting and have a huge effect on the melt rate of the permafrost. "Just as bad, the permafrost melting would continue after 2100 which would lock us into even more warming. Under this scenario, meeting a 2°C limit would be harder than anticipated. The current IPCC targets do not adequately account for this feedback." This is essentially what arctic scientists have been warning about for a decade now but pointing out that the time scale is no longer centuries but just years, and this is another reason why the IPCC is moving up their next report date	False

House Republicans Back Another Carbon Tax Bill That's Bound To Fail Two Republican House members have signed their name onto bipartisan carbon tax legislation, a bill that stands virtually zero chance of passing during the lame duck session. GOP Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Francis Rooney of Florida are to introduce a carbon tax bill on Tuesday alongside Florida Democratic Rep. Ted Deutch. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, if passed, would slap a $15-per-metric-ton carbon fee on fossil fuel industries. While the bill has little chance of passing, it is intended to spark a debate over carbon pricing as the Democratic Party prepares to take over the lower chamber of Congress." ore than a dozen federal agencies just warned us that if we don't take dramatic action, climate change will knock 10 percent off of our GDP by the end of this century," Deutch, the bill's Democratic co-sponsor, stated to Bloomberg Environment. "Putting a price on carbon can help change the behavior of polluters. We hope our bipartisan bill will spur action on climate change before it's too late." That $15-per-metric-ton fee would increase by $10 every year until reaching certain carbon emission targets. In order to shield citizens from higher fossil fuel prices, revenue from the tax would be given back out to households. Sponsors of the legislation believe it would slash greenhouse gas emissions by one-third over a 10-year period and a 90 percent cut by 2050, compared to 2015 emission levels. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is notable in that it's the first bipartisan carbon tax bill introduced in Congress in about 10 years. However, given the GOP will control the Senate and White House for at least the next two years, it's passage appears quite bleak. The bill comes not long after an outgoing Republican lawmaker, Rep. Carlos Curbelo, introduced a carbon tax bill of his own this year. Cureblo's bill was more stringent, calling for a $24-per-ton fee on carbon. Much like the new bipartisan bill, Curbelo's was doomed to fail from the beginning — and he endured attack ads from the right for even introducing it. Long considered one of the most at-risk Republicans heading into Election Day, Curbelo went on to lose his Miami area House seat to a Democratic challenger. Curbelo was one among many moderate Republicans on the Climate Solutions Caucus who lost re-election. Altogether, 13 GOP members of the bipartisan climate group lost their elections, and numerous others chose to retire.

Editor's Note: This post has been updated with grammatical fixes.		Gender-based justice, Reparations, Universal income, Medicare for All... Incoming New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez brings with her a massive online following, influence she says she'll deploy only in support of candidates and politicians who support her plan for a "Green New Deal." The Green New Deal" is something Ocasio-Cortez invokes frequently in media appearances and rallies. So what's actually in it?Her office recently released the text of a proposed House rules change outlining the plan. The proposed rule change for the upcoming 116th Congress would require the creation of a "Select Committee for a Green Deal" that would be responsible for creating the plan by January 1, 2020, with corresponding draft legislation soon after. The text of the rule change lays out the committee's jurisdiction and required areas of action. Its scope and mandate for legislative authority amounts to a radical grant of power to Washington over Americans' lives, homes, businesses, travel, banking, and more. Early on, under "Jurisdiction," the document makes clear its grandiose philosophical vision: "The select committee shall have authority to develop a detailed national, industrial, economic mobilization plan for the transition of the United States economy to become greenhouse gas emissions neutral and to significantly draw down greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and oceans and to promote economic and environmental justice and equality." In addition to achieving its goal of "meeting 100% of national power demand through renewable sources," the document also repeatedly states the Green New Deal will advance non-environmental projects, such as, "social, economic, racial, regional and gender-based justice." Ocasio-Cortez's plan further claims it will (virtually) eliminate poverty: "The Plan for a Green New Deal (and the draft legislation) shall recognize that a national, industrial, economic mobilization of this scope and scale is a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States and to make prosperity, wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation." More specifically, Ocasio-Cortez's plan calls for, within 10 years, a series of lofty overhauls of American life [emphasis added]:Between its calls for "upgrading" homes and overhauling travel, public infrastructure, and even the way Americans consume electricity, the plan leaves virtually no facet of everyday life untouched. Think of how often you don't use electricity to imagine how much of your average day the plan wouldn't impact. The proposed committee would also have seemingly total oversight of American industry, with a mandate for pushing union membership. Under "Scope of the Plan," a section on labor states the committee's final plan shall: "Require strong enforcement of labor, workplace safety, and wage standards that recognize the rights of workers to organize and unionize free of coercion, intimidation, and harassment, and creation of meaningful, quality, career employment." Later in the document, Ocasio Cortez's plan imagines creating a national jobs force to help people participate in this "transition." The Green New Deal, it says, shall "provide all members of our society, across all regions and all communities, the opportunity, training and education to be a full and equal participant in the transition, including through a job guarantee program to assure a living wage job to every person who wants one." The plan also imagines creating governmental support for "transitioning" minority communities. The deal shall: "ensure a 'just transition' for all workers, low-income communities, communities of color, indigenous communities, rural and urban communities and the front-line communities most affected by climate change, pollution and other environmental harm including by ensuring that local implementation of the transition is led from the community level." More, Ocasio-Cortez sees this plan is being a vehicle through which social equality might finally realized through the use of reparations to right historical injustices. The final Green New Deal will "mitigate deeply entrenched racial, regional and gender-based inequalities in income and wealth (including, without limitation, ensuring that federal and other investment will be equitably distributed to historically impoverished, low income, deindustrialized or other marginalized communities in such a way that builds wealth and ownership at the community level)." And if that weren't enough to ensure that Democratic Socialism could be fully realized in America, the plan includes failsafe in the form of universal income and Medicare for All: The plan, it says, shall "include additional measures such as basic income programs, universal health care programs and any others as the select committee may deem appropriate to promote economic security, labor market flexibility and entrepreneurism." Ocasio-Cortez clarifies that this plan would not only need to be financed by taxpayers, but also the Federal Reserve and other institutions the government can create. The end of the document contains a Q&A, one of which deals with the plan's funding: "The Federal Reserve can extend credit to power these projects and investments, new public banks can be created (as in WWII) to extend credit and a combination of various taxation tools (including taxes on carbon and other emissions and progressive wealth taxes) can be employed." Ocasio-Cortez may not be in Congress yet, but she already has a plan to remake the way Americans drive, commute, live, work, and even use the financial system. Let there be little doubt how she aspires to wield power in Washington. Editor's Note: This post has been updated with grammatical fixes.	False

Commentary: No, Donald Trump didn't cause or worsen Hurricane Florence — here's the proof Accompanying every hurricane are numerous stories in mainstream media outlets suggesting disaster could have been averted had American elected officials done more to stop global warming, which left-wing pundits continue to insist is almost entirely being caused by humans' carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In article after article, pundits have claimed Republicans, especially President Donald Trump, are in some way responsible for Hurricane Florence. The Washington Post's editorial board — in an article titled "Yes, you can blame President Trump for Hurricane Florence" — even went so far as to say Trump was "complicit" for the storm. This is total nonsense. Not only are there countless good reasons to question the extent to which humans are contributing to global warming, there's no evidence indicating hurricanes have become significantly worse as a result of global warming. As Roy Spencer, Ph.D., an acclaimed climate scientist who previously worked for NASA, recently stated, "The fact that there has been no long-term change in global hurricane activity, and even a 50 percent decrease in U.S. landfalling major hurricanes over the last 80 years, means no one is 'complicit' in these storms." James Agresti, the president of the Just Facts think tank, rightly notes data appearing in the academic journal Geophysical Research Letters show "the global number and intensity of cyclones, hurricanes, and major hurricanes have been roughly level for the past four-to-five decades." Some have said Florence was made worse because of warmer ocean waters caused by climate change, but that's also false. Writing for Climate Change Dispatch, Michael Bastasch explains, "An analysis of Florence's path by Cato Institute meteorologist Ryan Maue showed ocean temperatures were 'abnormally cool' for most of the storm's trek through the Atlantic Ocean." Even the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, one of the most notorious defenders of the theory humans are headed for a climate catastrophe, admitted in 2012 there "is low confidence in long-term changes in tropical cyclone activity, after accounting for past changes in observing capabilities. However, over the satellite era, increases in the frequency and intensity of the strongest storms in the North Atlantic are robust. However, the cause of this increase is debated and there is low confidence in attribution of changes in tropical cyclone activity to human influence." And if all that weren't enough, it's absolutely absurd to say Trump is any way responsible for global warming because even if it is true humans are the primary cause of warming, carbon dioxide emissions actually dropped in Trump's first two years in office. In 2017, the United States emitted 41.8 million fewer tons of CO2 than in 2016, the largest reduction in the world. And from 2006 to 2016, the United States has averaged an annual reduction in its carbon dioxide emissions of 1.2 percent, according to an analysis by BP. The reason the Washington Post and others are consistently alleging, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that Republicans are somehow to blame for natural disasters such as Hurricane Florence is either because they know absolutely nothing about the topic or because they believe it will help Democrats win elections. Either way, you should stick to what the best-available science says, not the fear-mongering of anti-conservative zealots.
