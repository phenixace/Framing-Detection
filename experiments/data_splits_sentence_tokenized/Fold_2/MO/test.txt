Bokhari: Elites Want You to Eat Bugs, Live in Sewer Pipes, and Submit to Population Control Progressive political elites have decided that in order to save the environment, ordinary citizens must submit to radical lifestyle changes (while those same elites fly around the world on private jets and enrich themselves from trade with China, the world's biggest polluter). The reality may even be worse than the headline. Not only have progressive environmentalists suggested that we all switch to a diet of bugs instead of meat (especially steak, because cow farts produce carbon dontcha know), one Swedish scientist even suggested we devour the flesh of deceased humans to cut greenhouse emissions. This followed an article published by Newsweek in which two psychologists mused on the human taboo against cannibalism, noting that "philosophers have argued that burying the dead could be wasteful in the context of the fight against world hunger." Cannibalism for the climate — that's how far they've gone!Population control is another solution embraced by geniuses on the left. This dystopian idea attracted attention recently after Bernie Sanders brought it up at the last Democrat presidential debate, saying people need to be "need to curb population growth." But Sanders was merely popularizing an idea that's long been the dream of progressive environmentalists. A 2009 study estimated that every human child will produce, on average, 9,441 metric tons of carbon dioxide. As such, climate scientists were agitating for global population control long before Bernie made his comments. Looks like China, despite its pollution, does have something to offer the environmental movement — the one-child policy!Absent from Bernie's argument in favor of curbing the population was an acknowledgment of what it'll do to the economy and public services, two things that the socialist senator allegedly cares about. An aging populace with fewer young people producing tax revenue means a crisis for public services and a shrinking economy. Of course, progressives believe in opening the west's borders to admit millions of working-age people from foreign countries, so maybe that's their solution. Don't forget that we all have to stop driving if we want to save the climate, which means we all have to pack ourselves into dense, unaffordable cities instead of living in the suburbs. As left-wing environmentalists remind us, "suburban sprawl" also "contributes significantly to deforestation." But are there enough affordable homes in the cities?Well, that depends on how you define "a home." Is a recycled sewer pipe a home? The OPod Tube House is the latest "solution" imagined for young people who can't afford a real house or apartment in the city. These "homes" are constructed from recycled industrial piping, and are designed to be stacked on top of each other. If that isn't enough of a dystopian cyberpunk nightmare for you, consider "parasite pods" — small homes designed to be attached to larger structures like skyscrapers and bridges. They're "parasitic" — and we must credit the architectural students who came up with the concept for their refreshingly honest choice of name — because they cling to larger structures. Are you ready to be a parasite, for the environment?Fried insects for lunch, in your parasite pod, single-occupancy of course. Cycle everywhere, unless you want to face crippling carbon taxes. Drink your iced latte with a paper straw, don't have kids, and when you die, remember to donate your human flesh to a local restaurant. Meanwhile, our ruling class continues to fly to climate change summits on private jets, own multiple CO2-emitting homes, and advocate for unrestricted trade with pollution world champ China.

In Embarrassing Anti-Trump Rant, Schwarzenegger Misses the Point of Paris Climate Deal After watching Schwarzenegger's video, in fact, it becomes immediately evident that the actor and former politician has never read the Paris climate accord and has no idea what it says." resident Trump says he's pulling out of the Paris climate agreement. My message to you, Mr. President, is that as a public servant, and especially as a president, your first and most important responsibility is to protect the people," Schwarzenegger begins. He then proceeds to chronicle the negative effects of pollution in the United States." wo hundred thousand people die every year in the U.S. from air pollution, and half of our rivers and streams are too polluted for our health," he says." e can't sit back and just do nothing while people are getting sick and dying, especially when you know there's another way." Schwarzenegger goes on to suggest that without the Paris accord, we will face a "dirty energy future with asthma, emphysema and cancer." The trouble is, President Trump would heartily agree with Schwarzenegger's point (while perhaps debating the exact statistics). According to President Trump, clean air and water are exactly the issues that the EPA should be dealing with. But this has nothing to do with the Paris climate accord. Nowhere does the 25-page agreement deal with battling air pollution or cleaning up rivers and streams. It deals specifically with reducing greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), with the stated objective of combatting "global warming." Carbon dioxide is not a toxic gas. No one is dying from CO2 "air pollution," or from rivers and streams polluted with carbon dioxide. Some climate scientists, in fact, have argued that more carbon dioxide, not less, would be beneficial to the environment and to humanity. Growers regularly pump it into their greenhouses to achieve healthier, heartier plants. Everything Schwarzenegger mentions in his short video—from air pollution to clean water to asthma, emphysema and cancer—is completely unrelated to the President's decision to withdraw from the Paris accord. So maybe the next time he decides to criticize the decision to get the U.S. out of the Paris accord he should read the document first. Meanwhile, he should probably think about terminating that video.	False

"It's bad, and how we counteract it is with a climate summit, with normal people respecting the truth, and communicating that with other normal people, and combating the President of the United States in what are lies, distortions, and quite frankly, bizarre behavior."	California Gov.	The Associated Press contributed to this report.	"It's bloody combat."		California Gov. Brown on Trump: 'Something's got to happen to this guy... he's going to undermine America' California Gov. Jerry Brown ramped up his criticism of President Trump in an interview that aired Monday – calling the president a "saboteur" in the fight to combat climate change and saying that "something's got to happen to this guy." Speaking to MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell at an environmental summit in San Francisco last week, Brown tore into Trump for the president's controversial tweets about the death toll in Puerto Rico from last year's Hurricane Maria and urged voters to vote for Democrats in November's midterm elections in an effort to  thwart Trump's agenda." e never had a president who was engaged in this kind of behavior," Brown said. "I mean he's not telling the truth; he keeps changing his mind; he's sabotaging the world order in many respects." Brown added: "It's unprecedented, it's dangerous, and hopefully this election is going to send a strong message to the country; the Democrats will win…something's got to happen to this guy, because if we don't get rid of him, he's going to undermine America and even the world." Under Brown, California has become one of the main opponents to the Trump administration's policies on everything from land use to immigration. But there is perhaps no area where California has been more combative against  the White House agenda than the environment." alifornia has positioned itself as the center of the Trump resistance," Jessica Levinson, a clinical law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, told Fox News. "It's bloody combat." Earlier this month, Brown signed two pieces of legislation effectively banning the construction of any new offshore oil and gas pipelines in the state's waters. The new laws are meant to thwart a Trump plan to open nearly 1.7 billion acres of coastal waters to drilling. Shortly before the climate conference began last week, the governor also put his signature on legislation phasing out electricity in the state produced by fossil fuels by 2045." t's really extraordinary that the president can deny science like that," Brown told MSNBC of Trump's questioning the veracity of climate change. "It's bad, and how we counteract it is with a climate summit, with normal people respecting the truth, and communicating that with other normal people, and combating the President of the United States in what are lies, distortions, and quite frankly, bizarre behavior." Brown's criticism of Trump appears to have fallen on deaf ears at the White House, as the administration announced on Tuesday that it was rolling back an Obama-era rule meant to curb climate-changing pollution and easing restrictions on energy companies that allow huge volumes of natural gas to escape after drilling it from U.S. lands. The move rescinds much of a 2016 rule adopted under President Barack Obama that forced energy companies to capture methane, a key contributor to climate change. The replacement rule from the Interior Department does not have the same mandates for companies to reduce gas pollution. It comes a week after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed weakening a similar rule for emissions from public and private lands." We're for clean air and water, but at the same time, we're for reasonable regulations," Deputy Interior Secretary David Bernhardt told reporters. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Closing EPA's Great Lakes Office Would Put Nation's Water At Risk, Dems Warn Scott Pruitt That was the sober but urgent warning from congressional Democrats who on Tuesday penned a letter to EPA head Scott Pruitt urging him to preserve the Great Lakes area office amid rumors it could be shuttered as part of the Trump administration's efforts to slash the EPA's budget." PA Region 5 is critical to protecting the air, drinking water and health of residents in the six Great Lakes states the region serves, and closing its headquarters in Chicago would make EPA less efficient and effective in its efforts to protect human health and the environment," read the letter. And in a visit last week to East Chicago, Indiana, which is grappling with a lead contamination crisis affecting both the water and soil, Pruitt reportedly denied to a resident of the town that Region 5 was on the chopping block. About a month ago, the union got three press calls in the same day asking if it had heard there was announcement Region 5 might be closed. The Office of Management and Budget also issued a memo in March asking the EPA to propose two regions for elimination. Then, two weekends ago, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel issued a statement in support of keeping Region 5 open following reports in the Chicago Sun-Times and Politico that it was on the chopping block." here are about 1,000 people in Region 5 and it has the most industrial regions of all of the EPA," the employee, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal, told HuffPost.

Members of Congress who signed Tuesday's letter underscored the important role the region plays in ensuring a quick response to spills and contamination in the six states, which are criss-crossed with oil and gas pipelines ― spills often near the bulk of the nation's freshwater supply and the Mississippi River waterways.

While the broader debate centered on climate change and clean air rules, the waters rule was nearly as polarizing because its broad application could affect farming, construction and other activities near federally regulated waters.	The Obama administration "claimed it was in the interest of water quality but it was really about power, power in the hands of the federal government over landowners," Wheeler said.	The issue has often come down to the definition of "navigable waters" under the Clean Water Act.	The debate over the water rule was part of a larger political flashpoint over environmental issues during the 2016 presidential campaign as Trump tried to appeal to rural Americans exasperated by federal regulations and the loss of property rights.		Trump EPA takes aim at Obama-era clean water rules, prompting outcry from environmentalists WASHINGTON – The Trump administration is moving forward with a significant rollback of an Obama-era clean water regulation that has become a rallying cry for farmers and property-rights activists opposed to federal overreach. The new proposal, unveiled Tuesday morning by acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler and other administration officials, would ease Washington's oversight of small bodies of water, undoing a regulation President Donald Trump has called "a massive power grab." The new rule would replace an Obama administration regulation, known as the "Waters of the United States" rule that expanded federal protections to smaller rivers and streams. Environmental advocates warn the proposed rule could remove pollution and development protections from most U.S. waterways and pose far-reaching effects on the safety of the nation's tap water for more than 100 million Americans." ven a child understands that small streams flow into large streams and lakes – which provide drinking water for so many Americans," said Craig Cox, senior vice president for agriculture and natural resources for the Environmental Working Group. "By removing safeguards and allowing industry to dump pollutants into these water sources, Trump's EPA is ensuring more contamination challenges for utilities and dirtier water for their customers." But opponents of the Obama-era WOTUS rule say it unduly prevents property owners from being able to fully use their land because the rule's overly broad definition regulates ditches that temporarily flood as federally protected waterways." he old rule put Washington in control of ponds, puddles, and prairie potholes," said Wyoming GOP Sen. Tom Barrasso, who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee. "The regulation was so confusing that property owners and businesses could not determine when permits were needed." The crux of the rollback is a change in how "navigable waterways" are defined under the Clean Water Act. The 2015 definition crafted under President Barack Obama would narrow considerably under Trump, a move that Wheeler told reporters would make it "clearer and easier to understand ... that will result in significant cost savings, protect the nation's navigable waterways, and reduce barriers to important economic and environmental projects." Wheeler cited the Missouri Farm Bureau, which launched a "Ditch the Rule" campaign opposing the 2015 proposal because it was concerned the Obama-era definition was so broad it could apply to almost every acre in the state. The Obama administration "claimed it was in the interest of water quality but it was really about power, power in the hands of the federal government over landowners," Wheeler said. It's also confusing because the rule is enforced in only 22 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories. Under Trump's proposed rule, federal protections would remain for major waterways, rivers, tributaries, wetlands adjacent to federally protected waterways, certain lakes and ponds, reservoirs, and ditches used for navigation or affected by the tide. States would oversee most ditches, terrain that fills with water during or in response to rainfall, certain wetlands that have been used to grow crops, stormwater control ponds, and water and wastewater treatment systems. Additionally, groundwater would not be federally protected, an exclusion Wheeler said that was never supposed to be included. Wheeler disputed claims by environmental groups that the rule would remove federal oversight from at least 60 percent of the nation's waterways. But EPA officials also could not say what percentage would lose those protections. Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, said the rollback would send the country back to a time when environmental protections were few and far between." Back then, the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio, was so polluted that it actually caught on fire. Polluters were allowed to dump toxic waste into our waterways without consequence. Garbage littered our shores," Carper said. "It isn't just a coincidence that this is no longer the reality in our country." In one of his first acts as president, Trump signed an executive order in February 2017 to undo the clean water rule and instructed the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to come up with a new approach. In a Roosevelt Room ceremony with farmers and lawmakers at the time, Trump called the rule "one of the worst examples of federal regulation." The debate over the water rule was part of a larger political flashpoint over environmental issues during the 2016 presidential campaign as Trump tried to appeal to rural Americans exasperated by federal regulations and the loss of property rights. While the broader debate centered on climate change and clean air rules, the waters rule was nearly as polarizing because its broad application could affect farming, construction and other activities near federally regulated waters. The issue has often come down to the definition of "navigable waters" under the Clean Water Act. The Clean Water Act of 1972 makes it illegal to pollute "navigable" waters. Over the decades, disputes arose over the government's changing definition of "navigable" with opponents complaining the definition was too broad. Two Supreme Court decisions in 2001 and 2006 came down on the side of landowners, ruling that ponds at the bottom of a gravel pit and a marsh miles from any lake or river were not navigable and thus not subject to the act. Wheeler said he wants the rule to reflect the court rulings.

However, there's nothing neutral about collapse or chaos.	Pre-Extinction: Powerful and suggests another mass extinction is imminent if we do not change our ways today.	That changed in the 1940s when the term "Big Bang" was coined, which was a simpler, more relatable concept for the masses.		Climate Alarmists Want to Rebrand "Climate Change" to Something More Panic Inducing First, it was "global warming" and/or "global cooling." Then when they figured out that they couldn't accurately predict which way it was going to go, they settled on "climate change." Apparently, that phrase just doesn't have the oomph it once did, and the church of climate change wants to rebrand their apocalypse to make people far more scared and subsequently, obedient. An article by Aaron Hall in AdAge asked the question of whether or not people will be more apt to fall in line with the climate alarmists if they take out the neutral-sounding "climate change" and replace it with something you might hear Chicken Little screaming:Scientific terms often fail to resonate in meaningful ways. In the early 1900s, for example, no one had heard of the "hypothesis of the primeval atom." That changed in the 1940s when the term "Big Bang" was coined, which was a simpler, more relatable concept for the masses. This complex scientific concept is extremely well-known today because a better, more tangible term was applied to it. Can we use lessons from the naming of the Big Bang to rebrand "climate change?"Interestingly, Hall notes that politicians liked "global warming" because it sounded dynamic and scary, but since it was "too easy to poke holes in" they decided to move on to climate change. People began joking about wanting global warming whenever it got too cold outside and the politicians, much like the devil himself, can't stand it when people laugh at them. Hall, being a "professional namer," wondered allowed about whether or not people would take the church of climate change more seriously if he renamed it to sound scarier. He said that the new name needs to appeal to people who are unscientific to help them understand the severity of the problem and "inspire them to make more eco-friendly life choices and pro-climate choices at the ballot box." In other words, it needs to scare people into voting Democrat. What did his team of global namers come up with? A bunch of names that sound like bad B-Movie titles. These options are subtle brand shifts from "global warming," yet they deliver a more negative image. The names signal that ice caps are melting, but also create a more visceral image in the mind — that real feeling of "melting" when it's too hot outside. A meltdown is a disastrous event that draws from the ultimate terror of a nuclear meltdown, an apt metaphor for global destruction. In naming, we call metaphorical names "suggestive names," and they are one of the most popular types of names. Good brand names instill a clear message or even a direct call to action. Perhaps that's why climate change isn't powerful enough: "Change" sounds so neutral. However, there's nothing neutral about collapse or chaos. Both are states of events that you absolutely want to avoid. They ask each of us to do what it takes to avoid collapsing or descending into chaos. They both also use alliteration — using the same letter or sound at the beginning of connected words — a naming trick proven to enhance memorability. Arresting brand names often capitalize on vivid visual associations. They refer to a tipping point that we're catapulting toward and must find a way to avert. Because a boiling point is the point at which liquid vaporizes, it brings forth imagery of rivers, lakes and oceans boiling and disappearing. "Melting Point" paints a clear picture of solid matter melting. As glaciers melt and disappear, so does our way of life. It's time to take the gloves off and stop pretending. Sometimes a brand name needs to be hyperbolic to truly capture hearts and minds. If we don't take massive action now, Earth will be uninhabitable — an irreversible barren wasteland. Plants and animals will die. Humans won't be able to survive extreme weather like floods, droughts and fires. If we don't change, we won't even be able to spend time outside. "Scorched Earth" paints the direst picture of what's to come and what we must avoid and is likely the edgiest brand name from our exploration. Those were just the winners. Hall gives an honorable mention to these as well:Emission Critical: Focuses on the action we need to take: reducing emissions. Pre-Extinction: Powerful and suggests another mass extinction is imminent if we do not change our ways today. The Great Collapse: The collapse of ecosystems, economies and our way of life. Earthshattering: Creatively arresting — the complete destruction of the Earth as we know it. What's the takeaway from all this?Not that climate change is going to end the world. It's not. No real scientific data points to that fact. The takeaway here is that there are actually people out there trying to worry you into obedience and support for a leftist agenda, and in order to do that they're willing to play with your brain by changing up the words they use. As you see above, Hall even admits that they're willing to get hyperbolic in order to make you scared.	True

It's the biggest threat of all.	When a reporter later pressed him outside the White House, Zinke said that "of course" climate change is a factor in the California fires ― a rather unconvincing acknowledgment, considering previous remarks and the number of times Zinke cast doubt on the all-but-irrefutable body of scientific research that shows human carbon emissions are driving global climate change.

He emphasized the need for better forest management by pointing to the more than 120 million dead trees in California but failed to mention that the trees died because of a multi-year drought that scientists have concluded was made worse by anthropogenic climate change.		The Trump Team And The Problem That Shall Not Be Named "Most of the threats from climate change are 50 to 75 years out," Wheeler asserted, adding that the world should be "focused on the people who are dying today, the thousand children that die every day from lack of drinking water." Let's put aside the fact that climate change is not some distant challenge but one already wreaking havoc on communities around the globe — and that Wheeler has proposed gutting existing regulations that protect drinking water. It's absurd to act like planetary warming isn't a significant threat to the world's freshwater resources. It's the biggest threat of all. Climate change is a multiplier. Very few of the problems that we have right now related to water are going to be made better by climate change. That's not going to happen. There's no denying the magnitude of the water crisis in the U.S. and abroad. Droughts (which are made worse by climate change) lead to water shortages, while inland and coastal flooding can contaminate drinking water supplies. Under the current climate change scenario, nearly half the global population will be living in areas of high water stress by 2030, according to the United Nations, which warns that "water is the primary medium through which we will feel the effects of climate change." Last year's Fourth National Climate Assessment, the work of hundreds of scientists at more than a dozen federal agencies ― including the EPA ― documents significant changes in water quality and quantity across the country and warns that "water security in the United States is increasingly in jeopardy." The report details how rising temperatures and variable precipitation can have "cascading effects on water quality," increasing the risk of drought, pollutant runoff and harmful algal blooms." limate change is a multiplier," Caldas said. "Very few of the problems that we have right now related to water are going to be made better by climate change. That's not going to happen." It's unsurprising that Wheeler is calling for a massive mobilization to tackle water woes without acknowledging the climate change link, considering the administration's relentless push to boost domestic fossil fuel production. It is also reminiscent of former Interior Department chief Ryan Zinke's response to wildfires in the western United States. And in an interview with Fox Business after returning to Washington, D.C., Zinke said whether climate change is contributing to the infernos is "irrelevant to what's occurred."

Early in his tenure, former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt prioritized fixing Superfund, the struggling and financially strapped program responsible for cleaning up the nation's most contaminated sites. The administration then turned around and proposed slashing funding for the program, from $1.09 billion to $762 million. Pruitt said that it wasn't a lack of money that was plaguing the program, but rather "poor leadership" and "poor focus" on the part of the Obama administration. Superfund's problems have almost everything to do with resources, which have all but dried up over the last two decades. Superfund experts have said the administration's approach highlights its lack of understanding about how the program functions. EPA maintains that Superfund is a "top priority" and that it "is making great strides in accelerating sites through remediation and back to productive use." Yet the $4.75 trillion 2020 budget blueprint the administration released this month once again calls for cutting Superfund dollars, this time by 10 percent.	False

Apparently, Sloan's arguments and those of like-minded analysts prevailed on policy makers, and the country rejected the CET with its taxpayer funded subsidizing of renewables.A second blow to disciples of the Paris Climate Accord was last week's Austrian election, Solomon argues, "which saw two conservative parties with no interest in climate change — it wasn't even an election issue — come in first and second, making them likely to form a pro-carbon coalition government."		Report: Most Signatories Are 'Ignoring' or 'Abandoning' Paris Climate Commitments According to Lawrence Solomon of Energy Probe, a Toronto-based environmental organization, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is one of the only signers of the Paris agreement who is actually abiding by the exacting demands of the accord. Meanwhile, Solomon notes in an essay in Friday's Financial Post, "most signatories are ignoring, if not altogether abandoning Paris commitments, undoubtedly because voters in large part put no stock in scary global warming scenarios." Trudeau now stands almost alone in sincere support of Paris," Solomon writes. "The populist backlash — a revulsion at top-down governments laden with jet-setting politicians landing in posh places to preach restraint to the masses — has swept America with Trump's election, Great Britain with Brexit, much of Europe, and Australia." In the process, global warming enthusiasts are being swept out," he writes. Last week, Australia rejected its Clean Energy Target (CET), a lengthy proposal that would have forced electricity utilities to rely on renewables and other low-emission sources for a substantial percentage of their production. The measure had been put forward as a way of complying with requirements of the non-binding Paris agreement. Earlier this month, the prominent Australian economist Judith Sloan wrote a scathing essay decrying renewable energy as the greatest "scam" being perpetrated against taxpayers and consumers, greater even than Ponzi, Madoff or Enron. While sinking enormous financial resources into propping up renewable energy prospectors, national governments are providing no perceptible benefits to their citizens, Sloan wrote." ith very few exceptions, governments all over the world have fallen into the trap of paying renewable energy scammers on the basis that it is necessary, at least politically, to be seen to be doing something about climate change," Sloan writes, before providing readers with an avalanche of economic data to back up her assertion. Apparently, Sloan's arguments and those of like-minded analysts prevailed on policy makers, and the country rejected the CET with its taxpayer funded subsidizing of renewables.A second blow to disciples of the Paris Climate Accord was last week's Austrian election, Solomon argues, "which saw two conservative parties with no interest in climate change — it wasn't even an election issue — come in first and second, making them likely to form a pro-carbon coalition government." Germany, too, which has been a staunch proponent of anti-climate change regulations, has fallen "hopelessly behind in meeting its carbon targets," according to a leak. The current state of affairs has not only undermined Germany's climate policy, but also jeopardizes "Germany's international reputation as a climate leader," Solomon asserts. According to the analyst, popular opinion against German Chancellor Angela Merkel's "Energiewende" (energy transition) policies, which had doubled electricity prices, played no small part in Merkel's terrible showing in last month's national elections. Costs of the ill-fated Energiewende now total some €650 billion, a bill that weighs heavily on the shoulders of German taxpayers. Late last year, to their national embarrassment, the Germans had to be bailed out of a small energy crisis by Poland when the wind failed to blow for several days and a thick fog surrounded many parts of Germany, driving the output from renewables to just 4 percent of total demand. It was coal-fueled Poland that had to rescue Germany from its self-induced energy crisis." erkel may now be unable to form a government without the support of the libertarian Free Democratic Party, which demands an end to renewables subsidies," Solomon notes. And so around the world—except in Trudeau's Canada—nations are once again turning back to inexpensive coal rather than pouring more money into costly "renewables," and coal plants are being built at five times the rate that old plants are being decommissioned. This quiet revolution may simply be a welcome return to common sense and realism. After all, once the photo ops are finished and the politically correct accords are duly signed amidst solemn brow furling, political leaders must get back to the business of meeting the real needs of their citizens—which all depend on the availability of affordable energy.

Methane rule survival a win for national security, taxpayers and the environment flickr/ Tim EvansonGood news, these days, is hard to find. So when a vote to overturn a relatively obscure rule governing oil and gas drilling on public lands failed, green groups were understandably jubilant. Fifty-one senators decided to put the best interests of taxpayers and the environment first, and narrowly saved a rule to limit methane emissions. This means that instead of wasting hundreds of millions of dollars worth of natural gas (methane is its primary component), companies will capture and sell it. Because companies drilling on public land pay royalties on the oil and gas sold, this means the public will receive tens of millions of dollars in revenue from gas that's currently burned or left to leak out and pollute the atmosphere. This means more money in our coffers and less greenhouse gas in our atmosphere. But lost in the post-vote beltway analysis is the fact that this is also a big win for national security. While that's not the most apparent result of the vote, it's one that should resonate with the Republicans who otherwise champion the military but bristle at environmental protections. That's because the rule puts otherwise wasted methane to use, boosting our energy security and reducing our dependence on foreign sources of energy. Since natural gas is sold globally, and Russia is a major exporter, boosting US production like this rule does cuts into Russia's share of the market. The more we produce, the less our European allies have to rely on Russian gas for their power supply. By making our natural gas production more efficient, this rule also lessens our reliance on even less friendly fossil fuel exporters, including countries to which we all too often send American soldiers. By producing energy in the United States and limiting pollution, we're making the world safer. Natural gas is not exactly beloved by the environmental community, but it can take much of the credit for reducing the use of coal, which is much dirtier and more harmful. So while some may say that Obama's environmental rules constituted a 'War on Coal,' in reality it was the cheap and plentiful supply of natural gas that put coal out of business. Ultimately, we'll need to transition from natural gas to renewable and zero-carbon energies like solar, wind, and next generation nuclear power if we want to maintain low-cost energy and a safe and secure climate. Even with protections in place, gas remains a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which cause plenty of problems. As a just-published report from the intelligence community details, climate change is a major military issue, acting as a "threat multiplier," which creates the conditions&#8211;drought and food scarcity for example&#8211;that breed instability and conflict. Extreme weather events, made worse by climate change, disrupt local communities and weaken the civic institutions that act as a bulwark against terrorists and extremism. The report also notes that the ecological damage done by climate change has human impacts. Communities that could once comfortably live off the land are forced out of the fields and forests and into urban areas where tensions run high and food supplies low. No one is saying that reducing methane leaks from gas drilling will prevent the next major conflict or humanitarian crisis. But with a problem as big as climate change, and as multifaceted as national security, every step is worthwhile. The better we protect our environment, the better we can protect people. Making sure companies capture and sell the gas drilled on public lands ensures that the American taxpayers get the biggest return possible for leasing that land. For anyone growing cynical watching beltway politics, Wednesday's victory on the methane rule was a rare and welcome reminder that common sense can still win out over the deep pockets of the oil and gas lobby. The vote was a win for taxpayers, a win for the environment, a win for national security, and a win for democracy.	True
780	CBS News	left_center_bias	2017-06-02	It's now crystal clear President Trump is comfortable both ceding the moral high ground and the economic upper hand to countries like China, and endangering the future of our planet."	We can, and we must do both.	But we will not jeopardize our economy in order to please other counties that don't come anywhere near our environmental standards."	President Trump's decision will prove to be the right course of action and one I fully support."	Mayors and cities around the world to uphold the tenets of the Paris climate agreement and protect Boston against the very real impacts of climate change."		Trump supporters, opponents react to Paris climate agreement pullout President Trump followed through on his campaign promise to withdraw from the Paris climate accord by formally announcing the U.S. intention to pull out of the agreement, saying the move would help American workers and the economy." The Paris climate accord is simply the latest example of Washington entering an agreement that disadvantages the U.S. leaving American workers, who I love, and tax payers to absorb the cost in terms of lost jobs and lower wages and vastly diminished economic reduction," Mr. Trump said. Following Mr. Trump's announcement , reaction from both supporters applauding Mr. Trump's move, as well as those who disagree with the pull out, was swift across the political spectrum." The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created.  I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack.  But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got." Removing the United States from the Paris Agreement is a reckless and indefensible action. It undermines America's standing in the world and threatens to damage humanity's ability to solve the climate crisis in time. But make no mistake: if President Trump won't lead, the American people will. President Trump's decision is profoundly in conflict with what the majority of Americans want from our president; but no matter what he does, we will ensure that our inevitable transition to a clean energy economy continues." The Paris climate agreement was simply a raw deal for America. Signed by President Obama without Senate ratification, it would have driven up the cost of energy, hitting middle-class and low-income Americans the hardest. In order to unleash the power of the American economy, our government must encourage production of American energy. I commend President Trump for fulfilling his commitment to the American people and withdrawing from this bad deal." I applaud President Trump and his administration for dealing yet another significant blow to the Obama Administration's assault on domestic energy production and jobs. President Obama made commitments in this deal based off a costly power plan that we knew at the time was on shaky legal ground. By withdrawing from this unattainable mandate, President Trump has reiterated his commitment to protecting middle class families across the country and workers throughout coal country from higher energy prices and potential job loss." President Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement is a devastating failure of historic proportions. Future generations will look back on President Trump's decision as one of the worst policy moves made in the 21st century because of the huge damage to our economy, our environment and our geopolitical standing. Pulling out of the Paris agreement doesn't put America first, it puts America last in recognizing science, in being a world leader and protecting our own shore line, our economy and our planet. It's now crystal clear President Trump is comfortable both ceding the moral high ground and the economic upper hand to countries like China, and endangering the future of our planet." By walking away from this pact, President Trump is abandoning America's leadership position in the fight against the climate crisis and is sending a strong message to the rest of the world to create, design and manufacture clean energy solutions and create jobs elsewhere.  If President Trump wants nations like China and India to take stronger and swifter action on climate, then he should do so through the accountability and enforcement provisions in the Paris Agreement, not by breaking our word and storming out of the room." Today the President announced that the United States will no longer be bound by an agreement unilaterally entered into by the Obama Administration. This was neither submitted to nor ratified by the U.S. Senate, and is not in the best long term economic interest of the United States. President Trump's decision will prove to be the right course of action and one I fully support." Withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement isn't just a setback, it's irresponsible. This damages our nation's reputation as an international leader and puts future generations at risk to the threat of climate change. Boston will not standby given what's at stake. As Mayor, I will continue to work with U.S. Mayors and cities around the world to uphold the tenets of the Paris climate agreement and protect Boston against the very real impacts of climate change." As a Governor, I always worked to balance economic growth and environmental protection.  We can, and we must do both.  President Trump acted in America's best interest, moving away from a flawed agreement that placed too heavy a burden on American jobs, and opening the door to a new agreement that reaches the right balance.  America will remain a leader in environmental protection.  But we will not jeopardize our economy in order to please other counties that don't come anywhere near our environmental standards." The decision by the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change is a major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security. The Secretary-General remains confident that cities, states and businesses within the United States -- along with other countries -- will continue to demonstrate vision and leadership by working for the low-carbon, resilient economic growth that will create quality jobs and markets for 21st century prosperity. It is crucial that the United States remains a leader on environmental issues."	False

Exxon Mobil Lends Its Support to a Carbon Tax Proposal The proposal also says companies that emit greenhouse gases should be protected from lawsuits over their contribution to climate change. Michael B. Gerrard, the director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School and an expert on climate litigation, said there had been four suits brought against energy companies over climate change, including one brought by the eroding Arctic coastal town of Kivalina, Alaska. "None of those has gotten very far," Mr. Gerrard said, but "there continues to be talk of more." Mr. Gerrard added, "If a sufficiently high carbon tax were imposed, it could accomplish a lot more for fighting climate change than liability suits." The Climate Leadership Council's plan sets an initial tax of $40 per ton of carbon dioxide produced, which would add 36 cents to the cost of each gallon of gasoline sold. The group estimates the tax would raise more than $200 billion a year, and the rate would rise over time, dampening demand for fossil fuels. The average family of four would receive approximately $2,000 in the first year as a carbon dividend, the group says.A tax-and-dividend plan would cut American carbon pollution even as the Trump administration withdraws from the Paris climate accord, the group says. Exxon has said for years that it supports a carbon tax, at least in the abstract, but the company had never formally endorsed a proposal. In 2009, the company's chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, who is now secretary of state, called carbon taxes "a more direct, a more transparent and a more effective approach" than a cap-and-trade proposal Congress was considering at the time. In a statement, the current chief executive of Exxon Mobil, Darren W. Woods, said the company was "encouraged" by the climate group's proposal, which "aligns closely with our longstanding principles." A company spokesman said the liability component of the plan was not part of the company's decision to endorse it. Some environmental groups did not accept that explanation on Tuesday. "Exxon is signing on to this carbon tax proposal because they know it's dead on arrival" in Congress, said Jamie Henn, a co-founder of 350. org. He added that protection from liability would be important to Exxon, which is under investigation for its past statements and actions on climate change. Along with the oil companies, the plan's corporate backers include Johnson & Johnson, Unilever, PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble. Ted Halstead, the chief executive of the Climate Leadership Council, said the group did not accept corporate contributions. Some environmental organizations, including the Nature Conservancy and the World Resources Institute, are endorsing the plan. Individual supporters include the theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking; Steven Chu, a secretary of energy under President Barack Obama; Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor; and the Indian industrialist Ratan Tata. The plan's Republican authors include James A. Baker III and George P. Shultz, both former secretaries of state, and Henry M. Paulson Jr., a former secretary of the Treasury. But Mr. Halstead said the council had "moved a little more to the center," adding new leaders like Lawrence H. Summers, a secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton, and Laurene Powell Jobs, a philanthropist and the widow of the Apple founder Steve Jobs." or this to pass, it will have to pass on a bipartisan basis," Mr. Halstead said. Mr. Summers said the chances that Congress would pass a carbon tax in the near future were low. But, he said, "there is a reasonable shot that there will be an opening that will be taken in the next several years," especially because the dividends could benefit low-income Americans." t's hard to argue against a fuel tax that Exxon's in favor of," he said.

Set aside, for the moment, the appalling wastefulness of devoting seven hours — seven consecutive hours — of prime time programming to the subject.	Some of the candidates barely seemed to care.1. <sep> 	Pollak: The Craziest Things Said at the CNN Climate Town Hall Over the course of seven hours, the top ten Democratic candidates for president in 2020 committed to radical solutions to "climate change" — a problem that, assuming the worst-case scenarios are true, will result in our grandchildren being much richer than we are, instead of much much richer. Set aside, for the moment, the appalling wastefulness of devoting seven hours — seven consecutive hours — of prime time programming to the subject. Clearly, CNN wanted to make a political statement about how important it thinks climate change ought to be in the election. Good. Given that the United States is the only country in the world that has reduced emissions over the past decade-and-a-half while growing its economy, and that the main reason is the growth of hydraulic fracturing ("fracking"), which Trump has supported and almost every Democratic candidate promises to ban, the only choice is to vote for the Republicans. That is, if you really care about climate change. (Otherwise you're just putting party before planet). That wasn't the point CNN wanted to make. Nor was it CNN's goal to expose the ignorance and extremism of the Democratic field. Yet that is exactly what happened. Given 40 minutes apiece, the aspiring Democratic contenders showed that they are willing to de-industrialize the U.S. economy, put millions of people out of work, and lower the standard of living for tens of millions more, all for the sake of "science" they cannot explain and do not understand. It wasn't all the candidates' fault. CNN kept making "scientific" claims that ranged from half-truths to pure baloney. Again and again, for instance, moderators suggested that Hurricane Dorian was caused by climate change, or a sign of things to come. (It isn't.)But give the network partial credit for noting that plans like the "Green New Deal" will hurt mining and agricultural communities. Some of the candidates barely seemed to care.1. Taxing "carbon pollution." Some called it a "carbon fee"; others called it a "carbon tax." Former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-TX) was the only one offering a "cap-and-trade" system as an alternative. All believe that you should be paying more for fuel. None suggested making it revenue-neutral — say, by lowering payroll taxes — though South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg would redistribute the money to the poor. (Learn from California: that's not happening.) 2. Banning fracking. With the possible exception of former vice president Joe Biden (who agreed last month at the second debate that he would "eliminate" fracking) and former HUD Secretary Julián Castro (who would back bans at state and local levels), all of the Democrats want to ban the one innovation that has made the greatest difference for our planet in the last twenty years, powered the economic recovery, and made us less dependent on the Mideast. 3. Ending oil and gas exploration and extraction on public lands. The Obama administration tried it, too. Never mind that some public lands have been specifically set aside for oil and gas development. There seems to be little thought about the impact that would have on the U.S. economy, on fuel prices, and on national security. Nor is any credit given for industry advances in environmentally-friendly technology (except as a warrant for more regulation). 4. Banning nuclear energy. Perhaps with Nevada — the fourth state in the 2020 primary contests — in mind, most of the candidates objected to nuclear energy because of challenges around nuclear waste storage. Only businessman Andrew Yang and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) offered defenses of nuclear power as a zero-emissions alternative, with Booker making the obvious argument: if you believe we need to reduce emissions quickly, nuclear is the only way. 5. Banning plastic straws, discouraging meat, eliminating incandescent light bulbs. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) admitted that paper straws are useless, but wants to ban the plastic ones anyway, based on pseudoscience. Booker, a vegan, says you can eat what you want — thanks! — but the rest want you to find another source of protein. And the candidates mocked Trump for halting the imposition of energy-efficient bulbs — seemingly ignorant of health risks. The craziness didn't end there. Biden blamed climate change for the cancer and the genocide in Darfur (previously thought to be the fault of Arab militias slaughtering, raping, and displacing black African civilians). Buttigieg said he would explain climate change to folks in the heartland by telling them God thought greenhouse gases were a sin. Bernie Sanders suggested global population control, encouraged by organizations that promote abortion abroad. They all want to rejoin the Paris Climate Accords; none wants to submit them to the Senate for ratification, but several want to eliminate or evade the filibuster to pass the "Green New Deal" — the "green" socialist manifesto written by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). No compromises on the road to utopia. And plenty new material for Trump's campaign ads. Send a receipt to Jeff Zucker and file a form with the FEC.

Trump signs order to reverse Obama's ban on Arctic drilling U.S. President Donald Trump displays an Executive Order on "Offshore Energy Strategy" at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 28, 2017. (Photo: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters)On the eve of his 100th day in the White House, President Trump signed an executive order Friday intended to let energy companies drill for oil in currently protected areas of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. The move was swiftly condemned by environmentalists, but Trump hailed it as a victory for the economy." his is a great day for American workers and families. And today we're unleashing American energy and clearing the way for thousands and thousands of high-paying American energy jobs," Trump said, before signing the order. So far, Trump's energy policies have aimed at reversing the plentiful environmental protections established by his predecessor, former President Barack Obama. In the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Trump said the United States is blessed with wonderful natural resources, including offshore oil and natural gas reserves, which can be harnessed to stimulate energy production and job growth. He said the federal government has closed off 94 percent of these offshore areas, preventing potential energy production." nd when they say closed, they mean closed. This deprives our country of potentially thousands and thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in wealth. I pledged to take action and today I am keeping that promise," he said. Trump's signing of the "America-First Offshore Energy Strategy" comes a day before the People's Climate March, an international protest against Trump's energy and environmental policies. The flagship march in Washington, D.C., and the more than 300 affiliated marchers across the globe, are expected to draw thousands. Though similar to last week's March for Science, the march on Saturday will focus on Trump's efforts to remove regulations intended to protect the environment and curb climate change rather than scientific integrity. According to Trump, the new executive order begins the process of opening many offshore areas to "job-creating energy exploration" and rescinds the Obama administration's permanent protection of the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans.A month before leaving office, Obama banned offshore drilling in nearly all of the Arctic under U.S. control to protect marine life and prevent potential oil spills. He also declared portions of the Atlantic Ocean unsuitable for drilling. Obama relied upon a little-known 1953 law that allows the president to ban oil and gas drilling indefinitely in U.S. waters. At the time, an Obama administration official suggested that Trump would not be able to reverse the ban without an act from Congress because of its "strong legal basis." On Thursday night, Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke briefed the press on the content's of the executive order. He said it would direct the Interior and Commerce Departments to review offshore drilling and gas regulations in protected areas. As expected, the response to Trump's executive order from the environmental community was swift and harsh. Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, released a statement saying that millions of Americans concerned about the dangers of offshore drilling will not be drowned out, regardless of the oil lobby's influence over Trump." ust as he has throughout his 99 days in office, Donald Trump will fail in this attempt to destroy our beaches and coastal communities. The people have been heard and will continue to be heard," Brune said. Greenpeace USA's senior climate and energy campaigner Diana Best also released a statement condemning Trump's executive order. She said that renewable energy has already set the U.S. on course for energy independence and that offshore oil and gas drilling will condemn the nation to decades more of pollution." his executive order from the Trump administration is just the latest in a series of attempted rollbacks that most people in this country do not want, and only come at the behest of Trump's inner circle of desperate fossil-fuel executives," Best said. "Holing up at Mar-a-lago may protect Trump from an oil spill, but it will not protect him and his cabinet of one percenters from the millions of people in this country — from California to North Carolina — who will resist his disastrous policies."

Democratic presidential candidate O'Rourke lays out $5 trillion climate plan (Reuters) – U.S. presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke on Monday laid out one of the most detailed climate policies so far in the crowded Democratic field, calling for a $5 trillion investment in clean energy technology and infrastructure over 10 years with a goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman, made climate change the focus of his first major policy announcement, unveiling the plan ahead of a campaign stop meeting with scientists at the iconic Yosemite National Park in California." he greatest threat we face, which will test our country, our democracy, every single one of us, is climate change," O'Rourke said in a statement. The plan lays out a series of executive actions that would reverse the "energy dominance" policies of President Donald Trump, who has been rolling back environmental regulation to increase domestic fossil fuels production.O'Rourke's measures include U.S. re-entry into the Paris Climate Agreement, ordering a reduction in methane emissions from oil and gas operations, halting new drilling leases on federal land and restoring pollution standards for power plants. His plan also calls for raising taxes on the wealthy and on corporations to help fund some $5 trillion in projects to modernize infrastructure and clean energy technology over a decade. The net-zero goal in O'Rourke's and other climate plans means reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions 100 percent or offsetting them by as much as is emitted." he bill will be funded with the revenues generated by structural changes to the tax code that ensure corporations and the wealthiest among us pay their fair share and that we finally end the tens of billions of dollars of tax breaks currently given to fossil fuel companies," O'Rourke's legislative proposal states. The plan appears to align with some of the principles of the Green New Deal, a bold set of policy goals introduced by congressional Democrats, that would transform the U.S. energy economy to 100 percent renewable sources by 2030, using federal funds to invest in modern infrastructure and green job programs. Most of the Democratic presidential candidates, including Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, have embraced the Green New Deal, which has become a focus of attacks by the Republican party, which calls it unfeasible. Other candidates have announced some specific policy measures related to climate change and the environment in recent weeks, and Warren has unveiled a public lands policy that would ban new drilling and mining leases on federal lands. Environmental group the League of Conservation Voters on Monday praised O'Rourke's plan, saying that it offered "the kind of leadership we need from the next president." Still, the upstart Sunrise Movement, the youth-led group that has pushed the Green New Deal into the spotlight, said O'Rourke's plan fell short of what they said scientists said was necessary to fend off the worst impacts of climate change. The Green New Deal calls for achieving net zero emissions within a decade, not by mid-century, as O'Rourke's plan sets out." eto claims to support the Green New Deal, but his plan is out of line with the timeline it lays out and the scale of action that scientists say is necessary to take here in the United States to give our generation a livable future," said Sunrise founder Varshini Prakash.

China 'Greens' Its Economy By Funding Massive Coal Projects In Pakistan China is helping Pakistan build up its energy sector, including a $3.5 billion joint venture to extract 1.3 gigawatts worth of coal in the Thar desert. Pakistan plans to use Thar brown coal to bring electricity to the millions of people living in energy poverty or suffering through daily blackouts. The country could get 24 percent of its electricity from coal by 2020 with the help of China. It's one of many coal projects China is backing abroad, while it cuts coal mining and power generation at home to fight pollution. China also promised to "peak" greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 as part of the Paris climate agreement. China's energy ministry canceled more than 100 coal-fired power plants that were being planned or being built in January. The country reaffirmed its commitment to its Paris commitments after U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order rolling back global warming regulations in late March." s a responsible developing country, China's plan, determination and policy to tackle climate change is resolute," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told the Associated Press. China's coal use fell nearly 5 percent last year, but the country still gets 62 percent of its electricity from coal-fired power plants. The country's cut in domestic coal use comes as they fund coal projects abroad, including the Engro mine in the Thar desert. Another Chinese joint venture plans to build another coal project near the Engro mine in June. Another block of coal will begin production for electricity generation by 2019, reports the Salt Law Tribune. China has also backed coal-fired power plants in Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam. China is involved in financing or building at least 79 coal-fired power projects around the world. The total generating capacity of those projects is 52 gigawatts. Why the push abroad? It provides Chinese firms and investors with opportunities to make money off coal projects at a time when that's less politically popular in China. Coal workers also travel to these projects, keeping them from losing their jobs. The Engro mine, for example, has 350 Chinese workers, and the return on equity for Chinese investors is about 30 percent, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

EXCLUSIVE: Docs Suggest A Personal Vendetta Between Two Lawyers Might Be Fueling Climate Crusade Two of the attorneys representing various cities in climate litigation against oil companies have a history of suing and counter-suing each other over personal squabbles, according to documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. Environmental attorneys Vic Sher and Matt Pawa got into a multi-million-dollar legal dispute in 2014 stemming from a lawsuit they both worked on against ExxonMobil. Sher, who was with Sher Leff at the time, alleged Pawa's group, Pawa Law Group, failed to distribute money from a settlement in the case. Pawa, in turn, argued in a lawsuit that Sher was the one cheating him out of millions of dollars. Sher, who is now with Sher Edling, eventually paid Pawa about $6 million for the retributions, court documents show. The disagreement stems from a lawsuit New Hampshire filed in 2013 alleging Exxon negligently contaminated the state's water ways with 2 billion gallons of MTBE, a gas additive experts believe poisons drinking water. The intrigue comes amid growing bad blood between the two sides. The state initially sued 26 oil companies in 2003 over the contamination. New Hampshire previously collected over $130 million for MTBE cleanup from the other defendants. The jury eventually awarded the state damages of $816 million. Exxon was made to pay roughly 29 percent of market share, which equaled roughly $236,372,664 at the time of the lawsuit. New Hampshire's Supreme Court upheld the decision in 2015 after Exxon appealed the ruling to the top court.A dispute arose between Pawa and Sher in 2012 relating to the division of attorneys' fees between them under a contract with New Hampshire, which retained both to represent the state in the Exxon contamination case. A panel eventually awarded Pawa nearly $6 million for breaching the agreement. Sher Leff refused to comply with the final award, including payment of the amounts awarded to Pawa's law firm, even while Sher Leff pocketed more than $27 million in attorneys' fees from the Exxon case. Sher countersued in 2014, arguing Pawa entered into a secondary oral agreement that the legal fees associated with the case would be delivered proportionally. Sher's case was dismissed. Neither Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP, a California-based law firm that now employs Pawa, nor Sher Edling responded to TheDCNF's request for comment about how the nearly five-year-old lawsuit is affecting their current legal pursuits of Exxon. Both law firms — Sher Edling and Hagens Berman — are barnstorming the country, convincing cities to sue energy companies for allegedly contributing to damage caused by climate change. The rivalry between the two attorneys heated up Nov. 26 after San Francisco and Oakland fired Hagens Berman and hired Sher Edling to represent the cities as they appeal a court's decision to dismiss their lawsuits against Exxon. Hagens Berman is handling King County, Washington's lawsuit against five major oil companies. The California-based firm was also behind a now-dismissed climate lawsuit brought by New York City. (RELATED: Anti-Exxon Attorneys Suffer Setback Amid Rash Of Legal Defeats)Hagens Berman's fee would have been 23.5 percent of any winnings from its cases with San Francisco and Oakland. Hagens Berman stood to earn possibly billions of dollars in contingency fees depending on the total winnings, had San Francisco, Oakland or New York City won their global warming suits. Sher Edling, for its part, is handling climate lawsuits for six California cities and counties. Local governments suing fossil fuel interests argue state nuisance and trespassing laws, which have sometimes been applied to pollution, also apply to global warming. They also accuse energy companies of trying to downplay the harms their products allegedly cause. Hagens Berman and Sher Edling's drama comes after New York filed a lawsuit in October against Exxon for allegedly downplaying for decades the risk the company's oil products pose on the climate. The lawsuit follows over three years of investigation first orchestrated by former Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who resigned in April over abuse allegations from former romantic partners. The probe took many twists and turns and seemed to come to a halt shortly after his resignation. (RELATED: SEC Investigators Decide Not To Punish Exxon For Alleged Climate Heresy)Exxon engaged in a "longstanding fraudulent scheme" to deceive investors, analysts and underwriters "concerning the company's management of the risks posed to its business by climate change regulation," the lawsuit notes.

New global warming study is terrible news for alarmists, good news for plants, animals and people A new study published in the highly influential journal Nature suggests rising global temperatures during the 19th and 20th centuries may be linked to greater plant photosynthesis. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of California at Merced, estimated based on its models "the sum of all plant photosynthesis on Earth grew by 30 percent over the 200-year record captured," according to an article published on the UC Merced website. Photosynthesis is the process of converting carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, which power plants, using sunlight. According to the UC Merced article, "The research did not identify the cause of the increased photosynthesis, but computer models have shown several processes that could, together, create such a large change in global plant growth." The leading candidates are rising atmospheric CO2 levels, a result of emissions from human activities; longer growing seasons, a result of climate change caused by CO2 emissions; and nitrogen pollution, another result of fossil fuel combustion and agriculture," the article also claims. In other words, more carbon dioxide, which is being produced by humans at record levels, has improved plant growth, which in turn improves food production for humans and animals. Campbell said the evidence shows "a fundamental shift in the Earth's plants" and that "global plant growth should be a central goal for the human race." However, don't too excited, Campbell warns. He says despite the researchers' findings, which clearly show global warming helps plants—and thus also helping humans and animals—global warming has many negative effects, too, such as causing "climate change, which will increase flooding of coastal cities, extreme weather and ocean acidification." The researchers' study in Nature provided no proof of the claim global warming is caused by humans or that global warming will cause the severe problems Campbell said it will in the quotes provided by the UC Merced article. The study also offered no solutions for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions without causing severe economic and social problems for billions of people. The study did, however, show increased carbon-dioxide levels have, generally, helped plants and crops.	False

Climate Alarmists: Global Warming 'Wreaking Worldwide Havoc' on Migratory Songbirds Warmer temperatures are threatening American songbirds with dwindling numbers due to an inability to successfully breed, a new study from Scientific Reports alleges.A team of researchers studied migratory patterns of songbirds between 2001 and 2012 and claimed that of the 48 North American songbird species that migrate north, nine of these — or almost 20 percent — "didn't reach the grounds by the deadline critical for mating and breeding the next generation of birds," wrote Karla Lant in her summary of the reportPlants in eastern North America are "greening up" sooner than normal because of global warming, the report contends, while plants in the western part of the continent are somehow undergoing the process later. This means that birds such as the Townsend's warbler and the rose-breasted grosbeak "are arriving either too soon and being met with frigid temperatures or too late and missing out on the insect boom that coincides with the new plant growth," Lant stated. Either way, the birds have a much lower chance of surviving and reproducing, the report alleges, so the nine species identified are consequently in danger of dwindling numbers." s climate at the breeding grounds changes, birds may be unable to adjust wintering ground departure times and transit speeds sufficiently to match their arrival with altered breeding resource phenology, particularly leaf growth and the closely associated emergence of herbivorous insects," the report warns.

Trump's EPA to ease emissions restrictions WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is moving to roll back the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's efforts to slow global warming, seeking to ease restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. In a plan expected to be made public in coming days, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) declared the Obama-era rule exceeded federal law by setting emissions standards that power plants could not reasonably meet. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the 43-page document, which underscored President Trump's bid to revive the struggling coal industry. The EPA's new proposal would make good on Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to unravel Obama's efforts to curb global warming and follows Mr. Trump's promise to pull the United States out of the landmark Paris climate agreement. Nearly 200 countries have committed to combat global warming by reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. The EPA won't prescribe an immediate replacement to the plan, but will seek public comment on whether to curb climate-warming emissions from coal and natural gas power plants.A spokeswoman for EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt declined to comment Friday on the authenticity of the leaked document but said the Obama administration "pushed the bounds of their authority so far" that the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay to prevent the Clean Power Plan from taking effect." Any replacement rule that the Trump administration proposes will be done carefully and properly within the confines of the law," EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said. The plan was first reported by Bloomberg News. The Obama administration's cost-benefits analysis of the Clean Power Plan was "highly uncertain" in multiple areas, Bowman said, vowing that the Trump administration will present a range of scenarios to the public "in a robust, open and transparent way." Obama's plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions. The Supreme Court put the plan on hold last year following a legal challenge by industry and coal-friendly states. Even so, the plan has been a factor in a wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which also are being squeezed by lower costs for natural gas and renewable power and state mandates promoting energy conservation. Repealing the Clean Power Plan without a timeline or a commitment to propose a rule to reduce carbon pollution "isn't a step forward, it's a wholesale retreat from EPA's legal, scientific and moral obligation to address the threats of climate change,'" said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. While the Supreme Court has concluded that EPA is obligated to regulate greenhouse gases, "this administration has no intention of following the law," said McCarthy, who led the EPA when the Clean Power Plan was completed. "They are denying it just as they are denying the science. They're using stall tactics to defer action, ignoring the courts and the demands of the American people." Industry groups cheered the planned repeal, saying it would reverse regulatory overreach by Obama and McCarthy." The Clean Power Plan represented an unlawful attempt to transform the nation's power grid ... and raise costs on American consumers," said Hal Quinn, president and CEO of the National Mining Association. The Obama-era plan would have sharply reduced the number of coal-fired plants, making the grid more vulnerable to reliability concerns and increasing costs with "trivial environmental benefits," Quinn said. The new plan will save an estimated 240 million tons of annual coal production and safeguard more than 27,000 mining jobs and almost 100,000 additional jobs throughout the supply chain, he said. In the leaked document, the Trump administration argues that repealing the Clean Power Plan could spare an estimated $33 billion in compliance costs in 2030, arguing that the Obama administration overstated the rule's potential health benefits. Previously, the EPA had estimated that by 2030 the Clean Power Plan would prevent 90,000 asthma attacks and up to 3,600 premature deaths a year. The leaked document casts doubts on those numbers and says the EPA plans to perform updated modeling and analysis of health benefits and other impacts of the rule. Liz Perera, climate policy director for the Sierra Club, said repealing the Clean Power Plan "is about one thing and one thing only: helping corporate polluters profit."	False

States File Legal Challenge Asserting Trump's EPA MUST Fight Global Warming A coalition of states filed a legal challenge Wednesday against the Trump administration's decision to roll back a slew of Obama-era climate regulations. The legal motion comes after Trump signed an executive order targeting climate change regulations ushered in by former President Barack Obama. The New York-led group of states argue Trump's Environmental Protections Agency has a legal obligation to regulate emissions some climate scientists believe contribute to global warming." he law is clear: the EPA must limit carbon pollution from power plants," New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is leading the legal challenge, said in a statement. Other states behind the challenge include California, Delaware, Maryland and Massachusetts. The motion asks the District of Columbia U.S. Court of Appeals to toss out a request from the Trump administration for a delay in the court proceedings on an Obama-era policy known as the Clean Power Plan. Trump's executive order was largely aimed at halting the Clean Power Plan, which required states to slash carbon dioxide emissions from coal power plants. The plan was never implemented, however, because it was challenged in court by 26 Republican-led states. The Trump administration says this and other Obama-era rules hinder the American economy and create a stultifying business environment. The coalition of states argued in a statement the delay "would waste the substantial resources already expended in this litigation," according to a statement from the group. Schneiderman hired Howard Master, a prosecutor who served under an Obama-appointed U.S. attorney, to focus on corruption cases involving the Trump administration. Master's primary responsibility, according to Schneiderman's office, will be investigating and possibly prosecuting the Trump administration for possible civil rights abuses. Schneiderman's decision to hire Master may indicate the crusading AG plans to flood Trump and his administration with legal filings, subpoenas, and lawsuits, The Wall Street Journal reported."

He has engaged in a months-long investigation into whether Exxon Mobil illegally hid internal climate research from the public and shareholders. The Democrat based the bulk of his probes on research from left-leading media outlets, many of which receive funding from wealthy environmental groups.

He worked at the EPA early in hiscareer and was a top aide at the Senate Environment Committee before becominga lobbyist a decade ago. Maine Sen. Susan Collins was the sole Republican to oppose Wheeler. She saidin a statement that, unlike Pruitt, Wheeler "understands the mission of theEPA and acts in accordance with ethical standards. However, the policies hehas supported as acting administrator are not in the best interest of ourenvironment and public health, particularly given the threat of climate changeto our nation." Collins said she was particularly concerned that EPA has proposed to roll backrules regulating mercury emissions from power plants and moved to replace theClean Power Plan, former President Barack Obama's signature proposal to combatclimate change." here is no doubt that the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate changepose a significant threat" to Maine and the nation, Collins said, adding thatpollution from coal-fired power plants threatens Maine's natural resources,"from our working forests, fishing and agricultural industries, to tourism andrecreation." VIDEO  _At his confirmation hearing in January, Wheeler told lawmakers that climatechange is "a huge issue" but not the "greatest crisis." Video by PBS NewsHour_Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who supported Wheeler'snomination as deputy last year, voted against his promotion. Wheeler was not making "meaningful progress" on clean water standards, Manchinsaid, citing the agency's failure to limit the amount of highly toxicchemicals contaminating drinking water in West Virginia and around thecountry. The EPA has announced plans to place legal limits on the chemicals but has notyet done so. The perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, knowncollectively as PFAS, have been linked to health threats ranging from cancerto decreased fertility."  believe immediate action must be taken, and these efforts lack a sense ofurgency," Manchin said. Like Collins, Manchin also said he was concerned at EPA's attempt to undorules designed to limit emissions of mercury, which can damage the brains ofinfants and young children. Environmental groups, meanwhile, slammed Wheeler, saying that while hisbehavior is "less cartoonish" than Pruitt, he supports the same policies." heeler wants to turn the EPA into a wish-granting service for polluters, nomatter the cost to public health or wildlife. But it's only a matter of timebefore his dirty dealings land him in the same trash heap as his predecessor,"said Emily Knobbe, EPA policy specialist at the Center for BiologicalDiversity, an Arizona-based environmental group. America's Power, a trade group that represents coal producers, applaudedWheeler's confirmation." uring his time as acting administrator, Andrew Wheeler has been seen as athoughtful leader who understands the need for sensible environmentalpolicies," said Michelle Bloodworth, the group's president and CEO. Wheeler's"long experience in public service demonstrates his integrity in serving EPA'smission," she said.)	False

(If you don't believe me, I refer you to the movies Armageddon and Deep Impact.	By working on the theory that they have to scare the bejeebus out of the public, they made it easy for people to dismiss them when their Chicken Little prophecies didn't materialize.	So would the human race and many other living things.		Democrats Take a Nonsensical Approach to Climate Change Environmental concerns are real, but the planet still will be here in twelve years. Imagine there's a movie about a meteor heading toward Earth. It will be here in twelve years. Following Hollywood convention, once you got past the part where the maverick scientist or precocious kid discovering it struggles to convince the world about the threat, you'd expect the president or the military to leap into action. Congress is usually left out of such plots, but it's not a stretch to imagine that Congress would race to authorize a plan to send astronauts into space to prevent Armageddon or a planetary deep impact. (If you don't believe me, I refer you to the movies Armageddon and Deep Impact.)The initial rollout of the Green New Deal, a sweeping proposal to overhaul the U.S. economy and, taken seriously, society itself, was supposed to follow a script like this. The United Nations opened the bidding by announcing last year that we had twelve years to keep the pace of climate change from accelerating too fast to contain the damage. Like a high school game of telephone, this quickly became a blanket statement that we have "twelve years to save the planet." Climate change is a real concern, but if we did absolutely nothing to stop it, the planet would still be here in a dozen years. So would the human race and many other living things. In fact, if America did virtually everything the Green New Dealers propose, global emissions of greenhouse gases wouldn't change that much unless China, India, Russia, and all the African nations followed suit. There are people who nonetheless believe that climate change is a world-threatening calamity and that exaggeration is a necessary tool to galvanize public opinion. If you Google the phrase "twelve years to save the planet," you'll find people who think it's literally true. The problem is that we've heard these things before. In 1989, a U.N. official predicted "entire nations could be wiped off the face of the Earth by rising sea levels if the global warming trend is not reversed by the year 2000." In 2008, Al Gore warned that the northern polar ice cap could be gone in five years. Melting polar ice is something to worry about, but it's not gone. The reasons this is a political problem for climate-change warriors should be obvious. First, they are their own worst enemy when it comes to maintaining credibility. By working on the theory that they have to scare the bejeebus out of the public, they made it easy for people to dismiss them when their Chicken Little prophecies didn't materialize. Another problem, which compounds the first, is that they get greedy. Working on the premise that a crisis is a terrible thing to waste, progressives have a long record of trying to throw other items on their wish list into the anti-climate-change shopping cart. The Green New Deal, as presented by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.), includes high-quality health care for everyone, guaranteed jobs, paid vacations, a living wage, and retirement security. Indeed, it's worth remembering that environmentalists targeted the fossil-fuel industry for early retirement long before concerns about global warming were on the agenda. The anti-oil campaign began with the Santa Barbara oil spill in 1969, back when concerns about another ice age were still taken seriously. You can believe that climate change is a real problem and also be forgiven for thinking progressives are trying to pull a fast one. This is especially so when you consider that proponents of the GND also favor phasing out nuclear power, which could provide vastly more electricity than wind or solar (and more efficiently). Which gets me back to where I started. Imagine there was a movie about an incoming meteor that could be stopped only with a nuclear warhead, and the heroes insisted that nuclear weapons are just too icky to use, even to save the planet. Audiences would scratch their heads. They might also think they missed a crucial plot point if the protagonists proposed a sweeping government effort to stop the meteor and then, when given the opportunity to vote for it, voted "present" in protest. That's similar to what happened this week. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell brought the Green New Deal to the floor for a vote, and Democrats refused to vote for it. Instead, they harangued McConnell for pulling a stunt. They were right. It was a stunt. But sometimes it takes a stunt to expose an even bigger one.	False

In fact, none are designed to reduce fossil fuel emissions, which the report said is needed to combat extreme climate change, which otherwise will cause "substantial damages to the US economy, environment, and human health and well-being over the coming decades." President Donald Trump, who previously has called climate change a "hoax," has rejected the report's conclusion that climate change could be devastating for the economy, saying "I don't believe it." Here's what the administration has said and done since Thanksgiving:EPA acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the carbon-capture technology required by the Obama-era made constructing new power plants too expensive. But the decline of coal for power plants has been a long-term trend regardless as the energy industry has moved to less expensive sources such as natural gas. Environmentalists worry the proposed rule suggests the EPA will set new standards that would weaken the requirements that the agency uses to regulate other types of pollution. The administration may "be trying to lower the bar significantly for future new sources of pollution that the EPA tries to regulate," said Mary Anne Hitt, senior director of the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign. Sides with Russia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait at climate conferenceConsidering Trump announced the US would walk away from the Paris climate agreement -- which brought together the rest of the world -- it's no surprise the US continues to be an outlier on the international stage. Countries were asked to "welcome" the report put out by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which says governments around the world must take "rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society" to avoid disastrous levels of global warming. The US and the three other nations sided against "welcoming" the measure." The United States was willing to note the report and express appreciation to the scientists who developed it, but not to welcome it, as that would denote endorsement of the report," the State Department said in a statement." As we have made clear in the IPCC and other bodies, the United States has not endorsed the findings of the report," it added. At the recent G20 meeting in Argentina, which came just days after the release of that dire climate report, US diplomats insisted on noting that the US reaffirmed its intention to withdraw from the Paris accord.A clause in a communique signed by the member nations says the US "reiterates its decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and affirms its strong commitment to economic growth and energy access and security, utilizing all energy sources and technologies, while protecting the environment." When the US Geological Survey last week announced a major discovery of oil and natural gas underneath Texas and New Mexico, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke called it a gift." Christmas came a few weeks early this year," he said. "American strength flows from American energy, and as it turns out, we have a lot of American energy." Zinke's position involves the dual and sometimes competing roles of overseeing leases to develop resources -- such as oil, natural gas, and minerals -- and preserving federal lands for wildlife and human recreational uses. The Interior Department proposed to cut protections that benefited the sage grouse, a grassland bird that lives in the Great Plains and western states, which could allow for expanded oil and drilling. The plan would remove protections on nearly 9 million acres of protected habitat. The oil industry says any impacts minimal because of improved technology and more limited footprint needed for exploration.	False

Trump Administration Escalates Battle Over Environmental Regulations With California The Trump administration has escalated its fight with California over environmental regulations. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler sent a letter Monday to the California Air Resources Board threatening to withdraw billions of dollars in federal highway money unless the state clears a backlog of air pollution control plans." California has the worst air quality in the United States, with 82 nonattainment areas and 34 million people living in areas that do not meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards," Wheeler wrote. California's population, topography, weather and other factors do worsen air pollution there, but the state also is widely recognized as a leader in improving air quality. Under the Clean Air Act, states that don't meet federal air quality standards are required to submit "State Implementation Plans." Wheeler says California represents a disproportionate share of the backlog of such plans." Since the 1970s, California has failed to carry out its most basic tasks under the Clean Air Act," said Wheeler. He then laid out the penalties for failing to meet federal requirements, which include losing federal highway dollars. California is expected to receive about $8 billion in fiscal years 2019 and 2020. The Trump administration has been picking fights with California over environmental regulations recently. Last week the administration said it will revoke a waiver that allows California to set stricter car emission standards.A senior EPA official said the two actions were not linked and that California is the focus now because it represents the largest share of backlogged plans. Even though other states have similar backlogs, the administration has not sent letters to them. Gov. Gavin Newsom has been critical of President Trump's environmental record and challenged the administration in court. Newsom called Wheeler's letter a "brazen political stunt." The White House has no interest in helping California comply with the Clean Air Act to improve the health and well-being of Californians. This letter is a threat of pure retaliation," Newsom says. Former EPA officials say they were surprised Wheeler sent the letter to California."I just think it's so ironic that the EPA is chastising California, which has been so progressive in working towards cleaner air, more than any other place in the country," says Janet McCabe, who was an EPA official during the Obama administration and now directs Indiana University's Environmental Resilience Institute. McCabe says it's unusual for the EPA to publicly criticize a state in this way. She says typically the agency would communicate with a state privately and work out differences to encourage a cooperative rather than adversarial relationship.	False

Italy declares state of emergency in Venice after flood... Much of Venice was left under water this week after the highest tide in 50 years ripped through the historic Italian city (AFP Photo/Filippo MONTEFORTE )Venice (AFP) - Italy on Thursday declared a state of emergency for Venice after an exceptional tide surged through churches, shops and homes, causing millions of euros worth of damage to the UNESCO city. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said the cabinet had approved the state of emergency and ordered the immediate release of 20 million euros ($22 million) in funds for "the most urgent interventions" in the devastated city after Tuesday's flooding. Despite the emergency, tourists larked around in the flooded St Mark's Square in the sunshine, snapping selfies in their neon plastic boots and taking advantage of a respite in bad weather which has driven the high tides. Sirens warning of fresh flooding rang through the canal city early Thursday but the water level remained low compared to Tuesday's tide, the highest in 50 years. Conte, who has called the flooding "a blow to the heart of our country", met Venice's mayor and emergency services before jumping in a speed boat to visit businesses and locals affected by the tide. Residents whose houses had been hit would immediately get up to 5,000 euros in government aid, while restaurant and shop owners could receive up to 20,000 euros and apply for more later, he said. Several museums remained closed to the public on Thursday. As authorities assessed the extent of the damage to Venice's cultural treasures, such as St Mark's Basilica where water invaded the crypt, locals were defiant. Many stopped for their habitual coffees at flooded bars, drinking their espresso while standing in several inches of water. Austrian tourist Cornelia Litschauer, 28, said she felt mixed emotions seeing Venice's famous square half submerged." For the tourists it's amazing, it's something to see. But for the people who live here it's a real problem," Litschauer said, cradling her white Chihuahua Pablo." It's strange. Tourists are taking pictures but the city is suffering." The Locanda Al Leon hotel said its bookings had suffered from the international media coverage of the flood, with some guests cancelling their rooms after seeing images of Venice underwater. Under the arches of the Ducal Palace, a couple from Hong Kong posed for photos in the chilly morning sun." This (trip) was planned a long time ago so we couldn't change it," groom Jay Wong, 34, said." Actually this is a good experience. It's an adventure." Tuesday's "acqua alta," or high waters, submerged around 80 percent of the city, officials said. Only once since records began in 1923 has the water crept even higher, reaching 1.94 metres in 1966. Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi arrived for a private tour of the damage sustained to the basilica, while rival leader of the Italian right Matteo Salvini was due to drop by for the same on Friday. French tourist Manon Gaudre, 22, said seeing Venice submerged was a "unique experience"." The damage it's causing to monuments and the people is worrying," she said, wondering if climate change was to blame. Many, including Venice's mayor, have blamed the disaster on global warming and warned that Italy -- a country prone to natural disasters -- must wake up to the risks posed by ever more volatile seasons." We need to be resilient and adapt. We need a policy that looks at the climate through completely different eyes," Environment Minister Sergio Costa said Thursday. Mayor Luigi Brugnaro has estimated the damage to Venice at hundreds of millions of euros. The Serenissima, as the floating city is called, is home to a mere 50,000 residents but receives 36 million global visitors each year.A massive infrastructure project called MOSE has been under way since 2003 to protect the city, but it has been plagued by cost overruns, corruption scandals and delays." This engineering solution that will end up costing nearly six billion euros has got to work," Transport Minister Paola De Micheli said. The plan involves 78 gates that can be raised to protect Venice's lagoon during high tides -- but a recent attempt to test part of it caused worrying vibrations and engineers discovered it had rusted.

In environmental cases, judges often must sort out who has the legal standing to challenge regulations or push for protections."	The Supreme Court now for decades has said that environmental and aesthetic interests count for standing," Buzbee said.	Writing for a divided panel, he found that this "good neighbor" rule overstepped the EPA's authority.	"The Cuyahoga River, Love Canal — when there was no environmental protection."		Environmental groups troubled by Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh's record Environmental groups were not going to be happy with anyone President Donald Trump picked for the Supreme Court. But the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has them especially worried. A conservative who would replace the more moderate Justice Anthony Kennedy, Kavanaugh has a record of slapping back Environmental Protection Agency regulations during his 12 years as a federal appeals court judge. Kavanaugh could shift the court to the right in many areas. But Kennedy was especially pivotal on environmental cases, ruling with the majority on nearly all of them over 30 years on the bench — and often siding with the environmentalists in the biggest cases. Kavanaugh has a narrower view of what environmental protections the federal government can implement. That was clear from an Associated Press review of his opinions while on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, along with other writings and speeches." It threatens to take us back to the old days," said Pat Gallagher, the legal director at the Sierra Club, recalling environmental disasters from the 1960s and '70s. "The Cuyahoga River, Love Canal — when there was no environmental protection." Kavanaugh's backers don't see him as anti-environment." His rulings in cases involving the EPA say far more about the aggressive nature of the EPA in terms of trying to stretch beyond its breaking point its mandate from Congress," said John Malcolm, vice president of the conservative Heritage Foundation's Institute for Constitutional Government. Republicans hope the Senate can confirm Kavanaugh by the time the court's next session begins Oct. 1. But that is in doubt because of delays in reviewing documents related to Kavanaugh's time in President George W. Bush's administration. In his opinions on environmental issues, Kavanaugh has often stressed the importance of policies to protect against climate change before saying that Congress, not the EPA, should create those policies. One prominent example came last year in a majority opinion that found the EPA lacks the authority to regulate hydrofluorocarbons, chemicals linked to global warming. Kavanaugh wrote: "EPA's well-intentioned policy objectives with respect to climate change do not on their own authorize the agency to regulate." William Buzbee, a Georgetown Law professor who teaches constitutional and environmental law, said Kavanaugh often rules that either Congress didn't delegate duties clearly enough to the EPA or that the agency wasn't carrying them out correctly — in contrast with a history of judges giving wide latitude to agencies to try to solve problems." It's a move that sounds like an attitude of deference and separation of power," Buzbee said. "The effect is to take away an agency's powers to deal with real-world problems." President Barack Obama relied heavily on administrative action as Republicans controlled Congress for most of his presidency and resisted passing laws that favored environmental protections over companies. Kavanaugh addressed that in the hydrofluorocarbons case: "Under the Constitution, congressional inaction does not license an agency to take matters into its own hands, even to solve a pressing policy issue such as climate change." Kavanaugh took similar approaches in two major 2012 rulings. In one, Kavanaugh dissented from the circuit, wanting to grant further review in a case in which the appeals court upheld the EPA's ability to regulate greenhouse gases. In another, Kavanaugh wrote the majority opinion to eliminate a 2011 EPA rule limiting emissions from power plants and other sources to reduce pollution in neighboring states. Writing for a divided panel, he found that this "good neighbor" rule overstepped the EPA's authority. The Supreme Court overruled Kavanaugh. In a speech last year at the American Enterprise Institute, Kavanaugh praised the late Justice Antonin Scalia for applying a principle laid out by Chief Justice William Rehnquist to an EPA case. The "major questions doctrine," he said, "is critical to limiting the ability of agencies to make major policy decisions that belong to Congress, at least unless Congress clearly delegates that authority." Still, Kavanaugh has not always ruled against environmental regulation. In 2010, he wrote the majority opinion for a divided panel when trucking groups sued the EPA over California's regulations for engines such as those that power refrigeration systems on trucks. Kavanaugh praised the agency for properly following Congress' directions in delegating that narrow area of regulation to California. In environmental cases, judges often must sort out who has the legal standing to challenge regulations or push for protections." The Supreme Court now for decades has said that environmental and aesthetic interests count for standing," Buzbee said. "My sense is they count less for Judge Kavanaugh." In a 2014 case, he wrote the unanimous opinion finding that environmental groups did not have standing to challenge an EPA decision not to tighten carbon monoxide standards. There are also cases where he found that industrial groups have standing to oppose environmental restrictions. One of those came last year, when he was on a panel that unanimously found that logging interests had standing to challenge the designation of 9.5 million acres in California, Oregon and Washington as a critical habitat for the northern spotted owl. He wrote that industry groups showed clearly that they would face economic harm if logging was banned in the area. There are exceptions in his record. Kavanaugh was part of a unanimous 2009 ruling that found road- and transportation-building groups did not have standing to challenge some EPA rules. If Kavanaugh is confirmed in time for the new court session, the first case he'd hear would deal with an environmental issue. In the case, the private owners of land used for logging in Louisiana object to their property's inclusion in the critical habitat for the dusky gopher frog, which was added to the endangered species list in 2001, when fewer than 100 were known to be in existence — all in southern Mississippi. None of the frogs has been spotted in Louisiana for more than 50 years.A federal appeals court found the land's inclusion as a critical habitat was appropriate.	False

But they disregard some of its most important teachings when formulating policy. This includes the story of Noah's Ark. Noah's story holds powerful lessons for us today. We live in a time when it has become absolutely clear that global warming is starting to have a devastating affect on our lives. From super storms and floods like the disaster unfolding in Houston, to droughts and fires of unprecedented magnitude, the direct effects of climate change are now impossible to ignore. Rising sea levels will put whole swaths of coastal cities like Miami under water before the end of the century. Yet despite such ample evidence and warnings, the Republican Party still chooses to ignore the reality. And sometimes I wonder whether any amount of evidence could convince you to act. After all, we have a surplus of evidence. What is lacking is the political will of Republican elected officials, like you, to do anything about it. The catastrophe unfolding in Houston is yet another stark warning. People are losing their homes and their jobs. Some have lost their lives. Scientists expect monster storms like Hurricane Harvey to increase in number — and intensify in magnitude —as warmer temperatures disrupt weather systems around the world. As I write, Hurricane Irma ― a terrifying superstorm with the highest wind speeds ever recorded in the Atlantic ― is cutting a destructive path through the Caribbean. Cities like Houston and New Orleans, on the Gulf of Mexico, face the threat of severe and life-threatening impacts. We have a moral responsibility to address this urgent threat. But Republicans don't want to talk about the problem — or even admit it exists. Instead, the Republican strategy has consisted of aggressive denial of the facts coupled with staunch obstruction of any serious action to address the problem. Tragically, no industry has done more to block crucial action to address climate change than the oil industry. In fact, as Hurricane Harvey barreled towards Houston, two Harvard researchers were simultaneously releasing a report that detailed how Exxon Mobil spent decades lying to the American people about climate change. Now Exxon, along with other major oil corporations like Valero, Shell, Citgo and Phillips 66, has been forced to shut down its Houston refinery because of flooding from the storm. Port Arthur, the planned terminus of the Keystone XL pipeline, is completely under water. The executives of these oil companies are bearing witness to the boomerang effect of burning fossil fuels. They are glimpsing a future that millions of Americans will face as the climate crisis intensifies. Senators, I hope that you will take some time to reflect. Few politicians have done more to prevent action on climate change than the two of you, which I suspect may have something to do with the $5.6 million you've taken from the oil and gas industry over the years. But with so many citizens of your state suffering the direct consequences of climate change, I hope you can summon the moral courage to change course. We face an existential threat, and in the face of this, your specious economic arguments and lame, fossil fuel-endorsed excuses fall flat. We know that fighting climate change will reduce costs and create millions of jobs. We have the knowledge and technology needed to prevent future catastrophes. By doing so, we will create broad prosperity, cleaner air and water, cheaper energy for all, and, most importantly, we will save lives. Just as the evidence of crisis has made itself apparent in Texas, so has the fact that clean energy provides a better path for all made itself evident in the Lone Star State. Texas leads the nation in wind power generation, and it's on the way to becoming a solar energy powerhouse. Senators, it's time for you to join the team that is trying to do the right thing – not just in the short run, but with an eye to our shared future. The people of Texas need you to get on board with the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century: clean energy technology that will save lives, create jobs, and protect the amazing creation we all call home. On behalf of NextGen America, please know that the people of Houston are in our thoughts and prayers. We are also fully engaged in fundraising efforts to assist our fellow citizens affected by this catastrophe. Words do not suffice in a tragedy like this. This is a time for action – action to care for our fellow citizens in the face of disaster, and action to prevent a systemic worsening of the climate crisis by heeding the warning and doing what is right.

The press release stated:Pollution from coal-fired power plants is the largest source of carbon emissions and kills 7,500 Americans annually, down from 13,000 when the Beyond Coal campaign began expanding in 2011 through support from Bloomberg. To date, Bloomberg has invested over $100 million in protecting the environment and public health through its support of the Beyond Coal campaign. Since 2011, when Bloomberg Philanthropies first partnered with the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign, nearly 50 percent of the country's coal-fired power plants have announced their retirement, and deaths related to coal pollution have decreased by 42%. The press release said the new funding will be used to "maintain progress" despite the fate of the Clean Power Plan." he Trump administration has yet to realize that the war on coal was never led by Washington—and Washington cannot end it," Bloomberg said in the press release. "It was started and continues to be led by communities in both red and blue states who are tired of having their air and water poisoned when there are cleaner and cheaper alternatives available, cities and states that are determined to clean their air and reduce their costs, and businesses seeking to lower their energy bills while also doing their part for the climate." Without any federal regulations on carbon emissions, those groups have combined with market forces to close half the nation's coal-fired power plants over the past six years—and with this new grant, we aim to reach 60 percent by the end of 2020," Bloomberg said. Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, boasted that his organization and other activists are responsible for the closure of scores of "dirty power plants." Together, we have worked with local grassroots activists and partners in the nation's most vulnerable communities to secure the retirement of 259 dirty power plants and the promise of a brighter future, putting at the center of our work a transition that leaves no one behind and that demands good-paying, family-sustaining jobs for workers who depended on the fossil fuel economy," Brune said. "All of this and we're just getting started. Our movement is growing and our momentum is unstoppable. Our clean energy future is now." President Trump signed an executive order in March ordering a review of the Clean Power Plan as well as other environmental regulations.

I think there's probably a difference.	But I don't know that it's man-made.	The Associated Press contributed to this report.		Trump hedges on climate change denial in wake of Hurricane Michael; says 'there is something there' President Trump on Monday once again backed off his previous claim that climate change is a hoax, but would not say whether or not he believed it was a man-made problem. Speaking at a Red Cross center in Georgia, where he was touring areas devastated by last week's Hurricane Michael, Trump said "there is something there" in response to a question on climate change from a reporter." here is something there, man-made or not," the president said, before deflecting to note that there have been previous storms that were much more intense and destructive than the recent slew of hurricanes to hit the Southeast. Trump's comments come a day after CBS aired an interview on "60 Minutes" with the president who said he doesn't want to put the U.S. at a disadvantage in responding to climate change."I think something's happening. Something's changing and it'll change back again," he said. "I don't think it's a hoax. I think there's probably a difference. But I don't know that it's man-made. I will say this: I don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars. I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs." Trump called climate change a hoax in November 2012 when he sent a tweet stating, "The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive." He later said he was joking about the Chinese connection, but in years since has continued to call global warming a hoax."I'm not denying climate change," he said in the interview. "But it could very well go back. You know, we're talking about over a ... millions of years." As far as the climate "changing back," temperature records kept by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show that the world hasn't had a cooler-than-average year since 1976 or a cooler-than-normal month since the end of 1985. Trump's comments came just days after a Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issued a warning that global warming would increase climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security and economic growth. The report detailed how Earth's weather, health and ecosystems would be in better shape if the world's leaders could somehow limit future human-caused warming. On Monday, the president said that he had heard of the recent report and that he'll "have to take a look at it." Trump added: "I want crystal clear water, I want the cleanest air on the planet." Citing concerns about the pact's economic impact, Trump said in 2017 that the U.S. will leave the Paris climate accord. The agreement set voluntary greenhouse gas emission targets in an effort to lessen the impact of fossil fuels." 'm truly an environmentalist," he said on Monday in regards to leaving the Paris Agreement. "But that doesn't mean we have to put one of our businesses out of business."

Australia bushfires north of Sydney 'too big to put out' A "mega blaze" raging across a 60km (37 mile) front north of the Australian city of Sydney cannot currently be put out, fire officials have warned. The blaze across 300,000 hectares (1,150 sq m) is just an hour's drive from the nation's most-populous city. People who cannot defend their property from approaching fires have been told they should leave immediately. Since October, bushfires have killed six people and destroyed more than 700 homes across Australia. The severity of the blazes so early in the fire season has caused alarm, and prompted calls for greater action to tackle climate change.• How are animals faring in the fires?Fires have also raged across Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. What's the latest on the ground?Several fires have combined to form the mega blaze north of Sydney, although more than a dozen locations are affected across New South Wales. At one point on Friday, nine fires had been raised to emergency level warnings, although these had decreased markedly amid a brief respite in conditions later in the day. The north Sydney blazes were sending black fumes across the city, causing a rise in medical problems. New South Wales Rural Fire Service (RFS) deputy commissioner, Rob Rogers told ABC: "We cannot stop these fires, they will just keep burning until conditions ease, and then we'll try to do what we can to contain them." He said the 60km stretch from Hawkesbury to Singleton was "just fire that whole way". The RFS website listed five fires roughly in a line from Nullo Mountain to Wollombi as out of control at 05:00 local time on Saturday (18:00 GMT Friday), with another out of control at Green Wattle Creek, south-west of Sydney. Video footage from the Orangeville area showed firefighters running from a wall of fire and the Walkabout Wildlife Park has evacuated hundreds of animals. The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) also said that "some fires were too big to put out". Fire officials in Ingleburn warned: "If your property is not prepared for the bushfire season and you're not sure you are able or capable of defending your property if a fire approaches you need to leave straight away." Firefighters from Canada were briefed in Sydney on Friday and will be deployed across New South Wales over the weekend, to be joined by teams from the US. There appears to be little respite. RFS founder and former commissioner, Phil Koperberg, told the Sydney Morning Herald: "People are nervous and they have a right to be... the worst is yet to come". Tuesday is the next big concern, with temperatures inland of Sydney likely to reach 40C plus. Some firefighters have expressed concern that volunteer numbers might not be enough and that there are inadequate water supplies. One said the fires were "all ticking time-bombs - without rain those fires won't be put out". Sydney may be blanketed in smoke for weeks, if not months, RFS Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said. Is this fire season particularly bad?It hasn't come close to the fatalities of 2009, when nearly 200 people died, but the scale of the damage has been huge.• How bad is bushfire smoke for health?More than 1.6 million hectares of land have burned in New South Wales alone. The season has hit earlier than normal and has been exacerbated by drought conditions. Mr Fitzsimmons said: "There is an absolute lack of moisture in the soil, a lack of moisture in the vegetation... you are seeing fires started very easily and they are spreading extremely quickly, and they are burning ridiculously intensely." The BOM says that climate change has led to an increase in extreme heat events and raised the severity of other natural disasters, such as drought. Last week, the bureau noted that NSW had endured its driest spring season on record. It also warned that Australia's coming summer was predicted to bring similar conditions to last year's - the nation's hottest summer on record.• Australia may see 50C days 'in decades'The government has been criticised over its efforts to address climate change.

Delingpole: Trump to Repeal and Replace Obama's 'Stupid' and 'Job Killing' Clean Power Plan The Trump administration will repeal the Clean Power Plan, the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's effort to fight climate change, and will ask the public to recommend ways it could be replaced, according to an internal Environmental Protection Agency document.  The draft proposal represents the administration's first substantive step toward rolling back the plan, which was designed to curb greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector, after months of presidential tweets and condemnations of Mr. Obama's efforts to reduce climate-warming pollution. But it also lays the groundwork for new, presumably weaker, regulations by asking for the public and industry to offer ideas for a replacement. In 2016, when it launched the plan at Obama's behest, the EPA declared that the Clean Power Plan was a vital, cost-effective way of combating climate change which would ultimately benefit the U.S. consumer. However, an independent study by the Manhattan Institute showed this to be nonsense. The EPA's cost benefit analysis was fallacious; it had drastically underestimated the costs – which it claimed would be $9 billion a year, but which the Manhattan Institute showed would be closer to $40 billion; and it would make no measurable difference to climate change. Hence Trump's election trail promise and executive order in March this year requesting EPA chief Scott Pruitt to rescind the CPP. This was part of a wider war on the Green Blob which has also involved withdrawing from the UN's Paris climate accord. Had it been implemented the CPP would have required U.S. power plants to lower their carbon emissions by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels. Since carbon dioxide is a natural by product of almost every industrial process, the knock on damage to the U.S economy in the form of lost jobs and higher energy prices would have been huge. Note, though, that the CPP is not being scrapped altogether but rather being delayed indefinitely through judicial fudge. Janet McCabe, who headed the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation under Obama, said an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking could take years – meaning the replacement for CPP could be a long way off. "It certainly will draw the process out," she said. Some conservative groups have urged the EPA to scrap the CPP without replacing it, effectively ending U.S. regulation of carbon emissions. But some industry groups want a replacement to give utilities regulatory certainty and avoid possible lawsuits by environmental groups. So while it's good news that the CPP will probably never be implemented, the bad news is how difficult it is even for a determinedly skeptical president like Trump to unravel environmental regulation. Even within his own cabinet, there are numerous siren voices – Javanka; Secretary of State Tillerson; Economics advisor Gary Cohn – urging Trump to maintain his predecessor's disastrous green policies. This fudge isn't perfect – and it still doesn't solve the problem of the EPA's Obama-era Endangerment Finding on carbon dioxide which ludicrously treats a harmless, life-enhancing trace gas as an existential threat. But at least it's a step in the right direction: the green blob just lost another of its tentacles.	False

New York investors, including Goldman Sachs, have made big bets on the preservation of the Paris deal, according to The Huffington Post.		Climate Billionaire Elon Musk Quits Donald Trump's Advisory Council The shift in government policy likely will force Musk and his investors to revamp his sprawling business empire, which relies on government subsidies and on preferences for solar-energy over natural fuels. For example, the Los Angeles Times reported in 2015 that Musk's battery factory in Reno, Nevada is reported to have enjoyed roughly $1.3 billion in state subsidies, and his SolarCity company has gotten $1.5 billion from federal solar-regulations. In California, the state legislature allowed his Tesla Motors to sell more than $500 million worth of government-granted carbon energy credits, said the Los Angeles Times, and the state's anti-pollution agency allows the owners of battery-operated cars to use low-traffic "high occupancy" lanes in gridlocked Los Angeles. Musk's solar-energy company in New York state has reportedly gained $1 billion in near-term and short-term investment from Democratic politicians said the newspaper. However, those financial gains for Musk depend on higher energy taxes for the nation's established manufacturing sectors, especially in Midwest states. Breitbart described the economic impact of the climate agreement:Unsurprisingly, Musk is a strong advocate for growing "carbon taxes" on natural fuels. In a January 2017 interview with Gizmodo, Musk declared:CO2 [carbon diooxide] isn't exactly pollution, but it does cause warming and slight acidification of water if very large quantities are dug from deep underground and added to the surface cycle. The problem is the age-old tragedy of the commons. The common good being consumed is atmospheric and oceanic carbon capacity, which currently has a price of zero. This results in an error in market signals and far more CO2 is generated than should be. We won't ever go to zero CO2, but the rate over time should be dropped far below what it is today. Start low and increase it until the desired outcome is achieved. This can be offset by a reduction in other taxes, like sales tax, which is quite regressive. This is analogous to taxing cigarettes and alcohol more than fruits and vegetables, which everybody agrees makes sense. We should have higher taxes on the things that science says are probably bad for us than those that are probably good for us.

But the bigger challenge lies not in decoupling growth from carbon emissions but in decoupling human wellbeing and progress from growth.	Utility-scale solar farms - massive projects that supply power to the gird - such as the one in Ramanathapuram need to be re-evaluated, especially if they are to run in areas where water is scarce.	In June 2017, villagers in Tamil Nadu's parched Ramanathapuram district were protesting against a solar power plant - they alleged that more than 200,000 litres of scarce water was being extracted illegally from bore wells to clean the 250,000 solar modules daily.	On this count too, Tamil Nadu has a long way to go.		Viewpoint: The Indian state to become a global leader in clean energy India's southern state of Tamil Nadu is poised to become a global leader in wind power, according to a new report. But first the state must overcome its addiction to coal, writes Nityanand Jayaraman. The report - by the US-based Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis - predicts that by 2027, more than half of Tamil Nadu's power will be generated by "zero emissions" technologies - notably solar and wind. The state's current capacity to generate wind power - 7.85 gigawatts (GW) - is already impressive considering it is higher than that of Denmark or Sweden. But the report estimates that it could double over the next decade, and that solar installations too could increase six-fold to reach 13.5GW. If that happens, clean, renewable energy would account for 67% of Tamil Nadu's capacity, which could revive the state's debt-ridden utility. But in order to harvest that potential, Tamil Nadu needs to transform its power sector. Tamil Nadu's population is three times that of Australia and its per capita GDP is on a par with Sri Lanka and Ukraine. It could prove to be an example of how emerging economies can grow while slashing their carbon emissions. Assuming Tamil Nadu's GDP will grow at an annual rate of 7%, the report suggests that much of this growth can be driven by renewables. Installation and operating costs for wind and solar power have dropped low enough to compete with established but dirty sources of power such as coal. But that is where reality tempers the possibilities. The report argues that not only does Tamil Nadu not need coal or nuclear power, but that these projects are financially fraught. Electricity from new coal power plants is likely to be twice as expensive as solar or wind power. But, despite the bleak financial prospects, Tamil Nadu currently has 22.5GW of coal power plants in the pipeline. Pursuing these ventures will weaken the state utility's finances and its ability to invest in smarter, cleaner alternatives. There are other challenges too. Wind power can be generated only from May to October. Even during those months, production cannot reach its peak because the state does not have a large enough grid to convey excess electricity to other states. So, they will have to slow down generation from other sources. This also means the state is unable to import cheap power from other states during the remaining seven months when wind power is not feasible. Work is afoot to change this but its not guaranteed that the improvements will ensure that the grid can cope with the predicted generation. Integrating power from seasonal sources like wind requires a smart grid - one with a sophisticated system of supply and management that can adjust to variations in demand. On this count too, Tamil Nadu has a long way to go. But the biggest limiting factor for the state is likely to be water. Between climate change and reckless exploitation and pollution of rivers, streams and lakes, Tamil Nadu is staring at a bleak water future. At least 60% of groundwater resources in the state are assessed as over-exploited, critical or semi-critical, according to India's Central Ground Water Board. In April 2017, Tamil Nadu farmers camped out in India's capital, Delhi, staging dramatic protests - stuffing dead rats in their mouths, stripping themselves naked in front of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home and drinking their own urine - to underscore the intensity of the drought back home. In June 2017, villagers in Tamil Nadu's parched Ramanathapuram district were protesting against a solar power plant - they alleged that more than 200,000 litres of scarce water was being extracted illegally from bore wells to clean the 250,000 solar modules daily. Utility-scale solar farms - massive projects that supply power to the gird - such as the one in Ramanathapuram need to be re-evaluated, especially if they are to run in areas where water is scarce. The report predicts that Tamil Nadu will have 10.3GW of utility-scale solar installations by the end of this decade and only about 2GW of rooftop installations. Given that both the availability of sunlight and the demand for electricity are decentralised, it makes sense to maximise rooftop solar installations rather than to invest in large solar parks. The overall direction, if not the magnitude and rate of change, laid out in the report is not just possible but essential both financially and environmentally.A healthy and environmentally sustainable future requires more than just switching from dirty coal to wind or solar power. But the bigger challenge lies not in decoupling growth from carbon emissions but in decoupling human wellbeing and progress from growth.	False

Let us also learn to listen to indigenous peoples, whose age-old wisdom can teach us how to live in a better relationship with the environment," he said. Recent studies have shown that the language of "climate change" and "global warming" do not stir up an emotional reaction in people and so climate alarmists have issued an appeal for the use of more powerful expressions to provoke people to action. Last April, a team of advertising consultants from SPARK Neuro released the results of a study suggesting that worn-out expressions such as "climate change" do not frighten people enough, whereas stronger vocabulary  such as "climate crisis" and "environmental collapse" produced a significantly stronger emotional response. The expression "climate crisis," for instance, got "a 60 percent greater emotional response from listeners" than "climate change," the study found. In its research, SPARK Neuro measured physiological data such as brain activity and palm sweat to quantify people's emotional reactions to stimuli. Of six different options, "global warming" and "climate change" performed the worst, beaten handily by "climate crisis," "environmental destruction," "weather destabilization," and "environmental collapse." The pope has apparently joined the climate alarmists in employing more incendiary language, dropping his former references to climate change to speak of a "climate emergency" and an "environmental crisis" in Sunday's message. He also underscored the forthcoming United Nations Climate Action Summit as of "particular importance" while proposing that governments will have the responsibility there of showing the political will to take "drastic measures to achieve as quickly as possible zero net greenhouse gas emissions." Referring specifically to fires in the Amazon region, Francis called on everyone to "take up these opportunities to respond to the cry of the poor and of our earth!""Egoism and self-interest have turned creation, a place of encounter and sharing, into an arena of competition and conflict," he said.

In 2015, Greenpeace activists duped Happer into agreeing to write a report onthe benefits of carbon dioxide for a fictional oil company. The (real) coalcompany Peabody Energy has paid him to deliver testimony at a state hearing inMinnesota, and Happer has joined hands with groups like the HeritageFoundation, the Cato Institute and the Competitive Enterprise Institute – allrecipients of ample industry funding – to bolster Trump's agenda and castdoubt on the scientific consensus. As the New York Times reported in its article on the White House's new climateplans, both Happer and John Bolton – who tapped him for the administration –have received generous support from the Mercers, the rightwing family creditedwith both spreading climate denial and helping fuel the opioid epidemic. We can't know whether Happer genuinely believes the nonsense he's spouting, oris just being paid well enough to sound like he does. The answer doesn'treally matter. Any clear-eyed assessment of what the science is telling usspells out who the winners and losers of rapid decarbonization would be. Tocap warming at around 2C – a threshold many already dealing with climateimpacts argue is too high – about three-quarters of known fossil fuel reserveswill need to be kept underground, a reality that if realized as public policywould crater the stock price of energy companies. Climate scientist Kevin Anderson has estimated that if the top 10% ofgreenhouse gas emitters were to live like the average European – animprovement even for many of us in the United States – global emissions coulddecline by a third. It is ") with the laws of chemistry andphysics", according to IPCC scientists, to limit warming to the boldlyambitious target of 1.5C. The problem is our politics, and how much of astranglehold the fossil fuel executives with the most to lose fromdecarbonization have over them. Establishment Democrats, meanwhile, are asleep at the wheel. The pitch fortaking on the climate challenge is a compelling one for reasons well beyondthe fact that it could prevent runaway catastrophe. The Green New Dealpromises a well-paid job for everyone who wants one, a real mass transitsystem, clean and affordable energy and universal healthcare – a necessity aspeople leave their jobs to find new work in the transition away from fossilfuels. While several Democratic primary contenders have embraced the Green New Dealand begun proposing their own plans, the frontrunner in that race, Joe Biden,and the Democrats' congressional leadership have been cooler toward it,offering neither a decarbonization plan nor a compelling reason for voters toget behind them come 2020. That's a dead end for the planet, but also for theparty's political prospects. With Donald Trump at their helm, Republicans will keep denying climate changebecause it represents a dire threat to their fossil fuel donors' bottom lines. Democratic leadership would do well to follow the lead of their party'sinsurgent progressive wing, and take the climate threat as seriously.	False

Unwittingly, in conservatives' quest for equal treatment of different energy sources, they have adopted policies that reinforce government's role in dictating energy outcomes.	For example, while criticizing the tax credits for wind and solar power, conservatives have embraced subsidies for carbon capture and sequestration and government regulation on nuclear insurance.	An analysis of President Obama's environmental legacy by the American Action Forum found the negative effect of regulations on economic growth led to forgone environmental benefits (richer economies tend to value clean air more and emit less relative to production), and led to regulations that were about half as effective as claimed on paper.		Conservatives Need an Energy Vision For conservatives seeking a major victory, a great place to start would be to fix the mess of energy subsidies and regulations that have accumulated over the past eight years. In the years since Barack Obama took office, there were $548 billion in energy and environment regulations finalized, and the projected budget currently estimates at least $250 billion in federal energy subsidies. Attempts to eliminate these regulations and subsidies have been hampered by conservatives' lack of an overarching vision for energy policy. While the Left is happy to use regulation to promote specific forms of energy they find ideologically appealing, the response from conservatives all too often has been to weakly offer the "all of the above" catchphrase as a counterweight. Even worse, conservatives sometimes have played the Left's game in reverse, using government to promote their own favored forms of energy, rather than to promote competition and markets. For example, while criticizing the tax credits for wind and solar power, conservatives have embraced subsidies for carbon capture and sequestration and government regulation on nuclear insurance. Conservative principles uphold free markets, competition, and the rule of law — yet too many conservatives are content to get their electricity from regulated monopolies, or build infrastructure under outdated regulatory-approval processes that take, on average, 70 months to complete. While conservatives can be bellicose about ending the "war on coal," they have placed far less emphasis on the benefits of policies to improve liquidity in natural-gas markets. Responding to challenges in the energy sphere one issue at a time results in many conservatives missing the forest for the trees and not talking enough about what pro-market energy policy looks like. Unwittingly, in conservatives' quest for equal treatment of different energy sources, they have adopted policies that reinforce government's role in dictating energy outcomes. Even when Republicans showed budget discipline in 2015 by finally putting a sunset on several production and investment tax credits, they did so without ending all subsidies for wind and solar. The result is entrenched government preference for already mature wind and solar technologies, and stymied competition from emerging technologies, such as fuel cells and geothermal, that would benefit the most from the tax credits. Conservatives sorely need to define an energy narrative rooted in market principles. It should be one that centers on quality institutions and policies that leverage competition and consumer choice. Markets, not mandates or subsidies, will drive cost reductions, innovations, and deployment of clean technologies. An incrementalistic approach — one that seeks to level the subsidy playing field or merely to pare back Obama's regulatory legacy — will do little to foster the conditions needed for the sorts of innovation that both the Right and Left seek. Progressives who favor heavy regulation and energy subsidies had a field day during Obama's presidency. However, regulators likely overstated the net benefits of regulations, and the Clean Power Plan would have accomplished little, at high cost, while proving legally vulnerable and politically unstable. An analysis of President Obama's environmental legacy by the American Action Forum found the negative effect of regulations on economic growth led to forgone environmental benefits (richer economies tend to value clean air more and emit less relative to production), and led to regulations that were about half as effective as claimed on paper. Subsidies also have been inefficient. The National Academy of Sciences found that production and investment tax credits for wind and solar reduced carbon dioxide emissions at a cost of a whopping $250 per ton. A 2015 Congressional Budget Office report acknowledged that tax credits are less effective at achieving policy goals than alternative, market-driven policies. An AAF analysis of tax credits for renewables found the costs to taxpayers rose at a faster rate than the renewable energy output, indicating declining performance of the subsidies. The Left's focus on energy policy has been costly, with poor outcomes. The Democratic party has an official policy to cut pollution from energy use through regulation and subsidies, yet another AAF analysis revealed no pathway exists to achieve those stated objectives via regulation. Even assuming the targets were achievable at costs similar to past regulations, the economic costs of the regulatory burden would exceed $7 trillion. Conservatives should seek opportunities to shed regulations and subsidies in favor of market-oriented policies. This means a plan to phase out distortionary tax preferences completely. Expanding full-cost expensing in the tax code would boost R&D fairly and efficiently. Additional R&D benefits would come from shifting Department of Energy priorities from applied research toward basic research. Opportunities to cut red tape abound, from hydroelectric and advanced nuclear licensing to modernizing the Clean Air Act. Removing regulatory barriers to entry for unconventional technologies (such as energy storage) in wholesale electricity markets would help level the playing field. Rethinking counterproductive energy-efficiency regulations — which reduce incentives for innovation and risk taking with new technologies — should also be a part of the equation. Conservatives should also protect and enhance competitive energy markets. A report from the R Street Institute found that competitive electricity markets cut costs while boosting innovation and environmental quality. Strengthening these markets, while minimizing political interventions like power-plant bailouts, is crucial to the performance of the electricity industry. Improving rules that affect price formation in electricity markets will also help stimulate efficient investments. Conservatives have an opportunity to retake the energy narrative with a platform that favors competition and choice. It would be a return to conservative basics, where industries and technologies excel on their merits, not political popularity. In so doing, conservatives will advance the American economy and their political interests well into the future.— Philip Rossetti is a data analyst at the American Action Forum; Devin Hartman is electricity policy manager and senior fellow with the R Street Institute.

I Was Right When I Said That President Trump Saved The Planet A little over a year ago, I wrote that President Trump saved the planet when he pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement. The decision, I argued, "enabled the free market to do exactly what liberals want: Empower individuals to better the environment" — without government intervention. As individuals, we are taking steps to protect the environment by choice — not by mandate — and going green is paying off. According to the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) latest monthly energy report, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions are at their lowest point since 1992. Per-capita carbon emissions are the lowest they've been since 1950. We're also outpacing our allies, many of whom criticized President Trump's decision to put America first. In the last year alone, U.S. carbon emissions fell more than 0.5 percent, while European emissions rose 1.5 percent. It's the height of irony, given Europe's virtue signaling last year. After President Trump shredded his predecessor's unconstitutional "treaty," the globalist leaders of France, Germany and Italy claimed it "cannot be renegotiated." They referred to the "irreversible" agreement as a "vital instrument for our planet, societies and economies." The globalist decree would have left us spending trillions of dollars a year to mitigate a rise in global temperatures, without really mitigating it at all. The Paris climate agreement was expected to drop temperatures by one-fifth of a degree over the next century. Apparently, it wasn't such a "vital instrument" after all. Europe is failing to pull its weight as Americans cut pollution to historic lows. The decline in U.S. carbon emissions is a testament to the free market's enduring power. There is nothing more vital for environmental protection than our freedom to protect the environment as individuals — without Big Government and its endless red tape. Anti-Trump liberals and conservatives alike are investing in renewable energy, choosing hybrid vehicles over gas-guzzlers and encouraging their neighbors to do the same. We're cutting down on waste like never before. We're reusing more than ever. And we're recycling, recycling, recycling. This year, the environmental industry is expected to grow five percent to $407 billion — without the Paris agreement. By 2020, the waste management segment alone is projected to surpass $70 billion in economic activity, with an average annual growth rate of 3.6 percent. Corporate America is doing its part. Tesla is working on the world's largest battery farm in the California desert, reaffirming its commitment to electric vehicles and an energy grid powered by renewable options. The new power plant will be capable of producing "up to 1.1 GWh" of electricity — enough energy for millions of homes. Tesla isn't alone. Last year, 19 companies announced deals with energy providers to build 2.78 gigawatts worth of solar and wind generating capacity. At least 22 companies in the Fortune 500 have committed to buying enough renewable energy to match 100 percent of their electricity use moving forward. Earlier this year, oil and gas companies such as ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell met with Pope Francis to discuss climate change and put concrete solutions on the table. They're backing up their words: ExxonMobil is developing renewable oils from genetically engineered algae, while Royal Dutch Shell vows to become a leading supplier of renewable electricity." oing green" is creating new jobs and new industries to boot. As always, free-market forces outperform the unfunded mandates and taxpayer-funded, job-killing enforcement bureaucracies of Big Government. Even as the Left demands more environmental regulations, President Trump is wise to side with the free market. When individuals are free to choose when and how to adjust their daily lives to protect the environment — without government compulsion requiring it — the environment reaps the benefits. When private enterprise is free to experiment and innovate, we see a stronger economy and a real commitment to environmental action. President Trump understands environmental protection is impossible without individual action and private innovation. It's because of free enterprise the environmental industry is as large as it is today and growing. By protecting individual freedom from government regulation, President Trump is saving our jobs — and the environment to boot.

TARGETS COW FLATULENCE... Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's newly-released "Green New Deal" resolution has gotten a lot of attention for its 100 percent renewable energy goal, but the bill also vaguely references another source of emissions. The resolution calls for a World War II-style mobilization effort to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural operations. If that's the case, that means any subsequent "Green New Deal" legislation would have to deal with a major source of methane emissions — cow flatulence and burps." e set a goal to get to net-zero, rather than zero emissions, in 10 years because we aren't sure that we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast," reads the initial version of the resolution's fact-sheet. However, Ocasio-Cortez staffers have since removed "farting" from fact-sheet. Methane makes up 10 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions that scientists blame for global warming. Enteric fermentation, the digestive process in cows and other ruminant animals, is the largest source of U.S. methane emissions, according to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data. EPA says "cattle account for the majority of [methane] emissions in the United States for this source category," referring to emissions from enteric fermentation. Most methane from cows comes from their burps, not farts. (RELATED: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: 'Green New Deal Is About Social Justice')Being a non-binding resolution, the "Green New Deal" doesn't offer any specifics on how livestock emissions would be phased down or eliminated. The question then becomes: How do you eliminate emissions from cows, sheep and other animals?Certainly, environmental groups have increasingly called for getting beef out of people's diets in the name of the climate, but there are legitimate worries doing so would be a net negative on overall public health. Some scientists have looked into reducing flatulence from ruminant animals. The U.S. government funded a 2014 study to find out why some types of sheep burped and farted more than others. The Obama administration released a plan to clamp down on methane emissions in 2014, which included programs to cut emissions from dairy operations. Republican lawmakers worried the Obama-era effort could have resulted in new regulations or taxes on farmers. Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, but makes up a much smaller slice of America's emissions profile. Natural gas systems and landfills also emit methane, which Democrats and environmentalists want to regulate more.

CNN is giving 2020 Democrats 7 hours to talk about climate change CNN will host a seven-hour marathon of interviews with 10 presidential candidates about climate change on Wednesday beginning at 5 pm Eastern as part of its climate crisis town hall. A live stream of the town hall will air on CNN. com. You can also stream it via CNN apps on iOS, Android, Apple TV, Roku, Amazon Fire, Chromecast, and Android TV. The forum will also be broadcast on SiriusXM Channels 116, 454, 795, and the Westwood One Radio Network. Here is the format:The audience will be composed of selected Democrats, independents, and stakeholders. No public tickets will be issued. That a major television network would devote so much time to a single issue is a sign of how important climate change has become for Democrats and how successful activists have been in elevating the issue. Climate change has rocketed up the list of concerns for primary voters, with some polls showing climate change as the number one issue and other indicating that strong majorities want robust climate action from the White House. Activists groups like the Sunrise Movement have refused to let the Democratic National Committee ignore the issue, holding sit-ins outside their headquarters to demand a climate debate. The DNC responded that it will not hold a climate change debate for 2020 presidential contenders, nor will it allow candidates to attend a third-party debate. But CNN and MSNBC have found a loophole in the rules that still permits candidates to attend televised forums and town halls. CNN did not respond to requests for comment. MSNBC's climate forum is scheduled for September 19 and 20. In the past few months, candidates have been steadily releasing their own visions for how to limit warming this century. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, who made climate change the centerpiece of his presidential campaign and put out the most comprehensive policy agenda, is now out of the race, giving other candidates some room to distinguish themselves on the issue. Several candidates, including Booker, Buttigieg, and Harris, are issuing new climate plans this week. For the most part, the Democratic presidential contenders agree that climate change demands a serious policy response and that the US needs to become carbon neutral by roughly the middle of the century. And indeed many have voiced support for the Green New Deal and most have pledged to refuse donations from the fossil fuel industry. The main differences among the candidates lie in how much political capital they intend to expend on fighting climate change and what they would do with executive authority. The town hall will give them an opportunity to present their plans in greater detail, and with more nuance. In the prior two rounds of presidential debates spanning more than eight hours, climate change received just 35 minutes of airtime. Much of the discussion was shallow and uninformative, partly a consequence of having to split attention across 20 candidates.A forum format with one-on-one discussions with the candidates could better get at these distinctions, forcing candidates to make the affirmative case for their own policies rather than sniping at those from other candidates. On the other hand, a candidate in the hot seat won't receive any direct challenges from their opponents. It would behoove the networks to focus their discussion on getting at these subtle differences among the candidates, like what executive orders they would sign, how high climate change ranks as a priority, and what measures would a candidate pursue to ensure a just transition to clean energy. (Vox's David Roberts and I have come up with some questions that could serve as starting points.)CNN's climate change forum has immense potential to illuminate real differences among the candidates and inform the public about the often-weedy details of climate policy. However, it remains to be seen if there is an audience with a seven-hour attention span for a single issue. And there's always the risk that it could devolve into rote recitals of platitudes. Here's to hoping we learn something new.	False

This is critically important for two main reasons.	But there are, instead, lots of quasi-experiments and statistical matching studies, and they all find that air pollution is worse than we thought.		Trump EPA appointees want more air pollution — that's a very bad idea Climate change garners most of the headlines, but the Trump administration is pushing a much larger and broader pro-pollution agenda whose latest manifestation is a push at the EPA to overturn a long-established scientific consensus that fine particulate pollution (colloquially "soot") kills people. This is critically important for two main reasons. One is that for decades the EPA has been regulating various sources of particulate emissions and the science around how harmful they are plays a role in driving how strict those regulations become. The other is that particulate emissions play a key role in the bureaucratic politics of climate change. Because carbon dioxide emissions are global and the consequences of climate change are also global, it is generally hard to demonstrate that cutting a given source of greenhouse gas emissions will have large benefits to Americans. But most regulations that reduce carbon emissions also reduce much more localized soot — and taking into account the fact that soot has a marked tendency to kill people who live nearby the emissions sources is important to making the cost-benefit analysis math work. Tony Cox, an industry consultant Trump tapped to lead the EPA's Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, argues that the EPA's agency's current standards for evaluating this question does not feature enough causal rigor. He wants to abandon the current "weight of the evidence" standards that allows for a wide range of evidence to be considered, with credibility weighted according to the quality of study design, in favor of a very narrow class of studies that employ "manipulative causation" methods. But as Francesca Dominici, a biostatistician at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, writes with researcher Gretchen Goldman in a new Science essay on the subject, this loads the dice against demonstrating harms, because "randomized control trials are not possible (or ethical) when studying environmental hazards." In other words, you can't get a group of volunteers together and then randomly assign half of them to have the air they breathe be deliberately poisoned just to see how bad the poison is. You have to rely on ways of exploiting random variation through methods like observational data, time series, and quasi-experiments. It's true, of course, that you don't want to do a completely naive associational study and then leap to big policy conclusions from it. But public health researchers are aware of the limits of the data available and use matching, statistical controls, and other standard techniques to try to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Barring all that evidence would, as Dominic writes, "place a nearly unattainable burden of proof on the scientific community" and totally undermine the EPA's legal mandate to protect vulnerable people. Both the public health research and the EPA debate are largely focused on the question of soot's ability to kill people (through, e.g., asthma), but there's a big emerging set of empirical economics studies suggesting that fine particulates have a wider range of adverse cognitive impacts and are significantly underrated. In other words, the consequences of rolling back the war on soot could be substantially worse than the mortality impacts alone imply. Economists, like public health researchers, are limited by their inability to deliberately poison people in order to study the impact of the poisoning. Consequently, none of the studies I've read on particulate pollution and cognitive impairment quite reaches "gold standard" levels of scientific evidence. But there are, instead, lots of quasi-experiments and statistical matching studies, and they all find that air pollution is worse than we thought. In addition to killing small numbers of people, air pollution harms large numbers of people in small but meaningful ways:This is an emerging field of study, and it would obviously benefit from some further inquiry. That said, it appears to be the case that fine particulate pollution induces cognitive impairments in school children, white collar workers, blue collar workers, and the elderly — in other words, all people at all stages of life. Each of these impacts independently suggests that we are currently allowing too much air pollution, and they also cry out for more research that attempts to assess the long-term cumulative impact of pollutants that appear to induce cognitive problems throughout the life cycle. The question of exactly how much we are under-regulating particulates seems somewhat open to me, but the sign of the error is very clear.	False

This fire moved so fast - I don't think anybody did anything wrong," Ms Schori says when asked whether those forced to abandon vehicles and escape on foot could have acted differently."	The majority could be attributed to humans, though only 8% were caused by arson.	"It should be noted that 2% of fires burn 98% of the area."	And straying away from natural burning cycles has also contributed to the lethality of recent fires, Prof Peterson says.		California wildfires: Key questions answered In the last year alone, California has seen catastrophic wildfires burn thousands of acres. On Tuesday, the ongoing Camp Fire in Northern California became the state's deadliest blaze in history. How do these deadly fires start, and why is California so susceptible?Officials define wildfires, or wildland fires, as any fire occurring on undeveloped land. Forest fires are uncontrolled wildfires burning in lands covered at least in part by timber or flammable vegetation. In nature, two things can spark wildfires: lava and lightning. According to the National Park Service, 90% of wildfires in the US are caused by humans - whether by unattended campfires, burning debris, cigarettes, or arson. About 2% of California's 2,816 wildfires in 2016 were caused by lightning, according to data from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). The majority could be attributed to humans, though only 8% were caused by arson. According to Prof David Peterson of the University of Washington, a former senior researcher with the US Forest Service, fires in the region have not necessarily increased in frequency in the last 100 years - but the area affected has." The area burned annually has been higher during the past 30 years or so," he told the BBC. "It should be noted that 2% of fires burn 98% of the area." In California, recent years have seen a combination of extremely high temperatures, strong winds, a long drought, and population growth causing lethal, fast-moving blazes. Last year, the state had over 9,500 wildfires that burned over a million acres, according to the National Interagency Fire Center, and had the highest number of homes and buildings lost in one state. And straying away from natural burning cycles has also contributed to the lethality of recent fires, Prof Peterson says. Keeping fires from starting in Western forests has caused fuel to accumulate "far beyond" historical levels." Therefore, when fires occur they can burn hotter," he says. "These high-intensity fires can cause rapid and in some cases long-term changes in vegetation, making it more difficult for the ecosystem to recover." Once evacuation orders are issued by local law enforcement, residents generally have hours to leave, Cal Fire information officer Kathleen Schori told the BBC." But in those initial stages of fire, you may have minutes," she added. Fleeing in a vehicle is ideal as most wildfires cannot be outrun. But the Camp Fire's especially rapid spread, fuelled by high winds, made the situation even more dangerous." This fire moved so fast - I don't think anybody did anything wrong," Ms Schori says when asked whether those forced to abandon vehicles and escape on foot could have acted differently." During the initial phases, it was burning 80 miles in an hour." She stressed the importance of following evacuation orders immediately, especially with fast-moving blazes." If you don't evacuate and it becomes a rescue situation, then our firefighters are taken away from the firefight and moved to the rescue." Sometimes, you do fight fire with fire. In addition to old-fashioned water and flame retardant (delivered from ground-level and above the flames by aircraft), sometimes firefighters have to burn more to quell the flames. Intentionally burning areas around a wildfire can help starve the blaze and control its direction. Clearing out brush and flammable material from an area to create "firebreaks" is another way to achieve the same." Ninety-eight percent of fires are small and/or suppressed quickly," Prof Peterson says. "The other 2% are very challenging when they get large, and are almost impossible to put out, at least until it rains." Ms Schori of Cal Fire said that with wind-driven blazes like the Camp Fire, officials often have no choice but to wait for conditions to improve." There are never enough firefighters to combat a fire that's moving as fast as this was moving," she says." You have to deploy your resources on each side [of the fire] and continue to construct lines. And when that wind stops, then you can safely get in front it." Prof Peterson says there is no hard evidence that climate change has affected US wildfires - yet." We expect that there will be significant effects in future decades as the climate continues to warm," he told the BBC.A warming climate, Prof Peterson explained, would increase the duration of the fire season, and more droughts would in turn create more wildfire fuel. Globally, the length of the wildfire season has already increased by nearly 19% between 1978 and 2013." By around 2050, fires may burn two to three times more area than they have historically." According to 2017 data from Verisk Analytics, 4.5 million US homes were in areas of high or extreme wildfire risk - and over 2 million of those homes were in California. Damage caused by wildfires has cost $5.1bn in the last decade, Verisk found. In California, homeowners who do not qualify for private insurance coverage can opt into a statewide pool, called the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plan. FAIR is comprised of all property and casualty insurers in California and is not run by a state agency.	False

It concludes that temperatures in the U.S. have risen sharply, by 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit, over the last 150 years and that it is "extremely likely that most of the global mean temperature increase since 1951 was caused by human influence on climate."	"I mean, the fact is, this shouldn't be a debate about, 'Is the climate changing?		Federal Scientists' Startling Climate Report Released Before Trump Can Bury It The New York Times published an unreleased draft of the report Monday. The 543-page report was written by scientists from 13 federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It concludes that temperatures in the U.S. have risen sharply, by 1.6 degrees Fahrenheit, over the last 150 years and that it is "extremely likely that most of the global mean temperature increase since 1951 was caused by human influence on climate." Evidence for a changing climate abounds, from the top of the atmosphere to the depths of the oceans," the report states. "Thousands of studies conducted by tens of thousands of scientists around the world have documented changes in surface, atmospheric, and oceanic temperatures; melting glaciers; disappearing snow cover; shrinking sea ice; rising sea level; and an increase in atmospheric water vapor. Many lines of evidence demonstrate that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse (heat-trapping) gases, are primarily responsible for recent observed climate changes." The report, completed this year and part of the National Climate Assessment, has already been approved by the National Academy of Sciences, according to the Times. Its release hinges on the Trump administration's approval, and one scientist who worked on the report told the Times that he and others feared the president would withhold it. Also, the frequency of extreme weather events, including heavy rain and heat waves, has increased and is very likely to continue to do so. And since 1880, global sea levels have risen 8 to 9 inches — roughly 3 of those inches since 1990 — with human activity playing a substantial role, according to the report. In a post to Twitter, Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist and director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said that nothing in the report is surprising for people working in the field but that it may be "shocking to those that think [climate change] is just a future problem." The report delivers a strikingly different message than the one being pushed by Trump and his Cabinet members, who continue to downplay the urgency of the threat as they work toward "energy dominance." Since taking office, Trump — who famously called climate change "bullshit" and a Chinese "hoax" — has moved quickly to derail America's actions to combat climate change, including rolling back President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan, a policy limiting greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Trump has pegged himself as a savior of America's dying coal industry and has vowed to increase oil and gas production, opening now-protected areas of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans to drilling. In June he announced plans to pull the U.S. out of the historic Paris Agreement on climate change ― the international accord in which nearly 200 countries committed to slashing carbon emissions in an effort to prevent global temperatures from increasing 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the line scientists say the world must stay below to stave off the very worst effects of climate change. Meanwhile, his Cabinet members have refused to say whether Trump believes climate change is real and continue to question how much the scientific community understands about the threat and the role humans play in observed changes. In March, Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt told CNBC, "No, I would not agree that [carbon dioxide is] a primary contributor to the global warming that we see." And in June, Energy Secretary Rick Perry echoed Pruitt's comments, saying "no" when asked by CNBC whether he believes carbon dioxide "is the primary control knob for the temperature of the Earth and for climate." Most likely the primary control knob is the ocean waters and this environment that we live in," Perry said. "I mean, the fact is, this shouldn't be a debate about, 'Is the climate changing? Is man having an effect on it?' Yeah, we are. The question should be, you know, just how much, and what are the policy changes that we need to make to affect that?"Also in June, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said glaciers in Montana's Glacier National Park started melting "right after the end of the Ice Age" and that it has "been a consistent melt." He also dismissed the notion that government scientists can predict with certainty how much warming will occur by 2100 under a business-as-usual scenario.	False

Meds pose global environmental risk, experts warn... There are growing fears that the unchecked use of antibiotics in both medicine and agriculture will have adverse effects on the environment and on human health (AFP Photo/LOIC VENANCE)Paris (AFP) - Residues from billions of doses of antibiotics, painkillers and antidepressants pose a significant risk to freshwater ecosystems and the global food chain, a new analysis said Thursday. There are growing fears that the unchecked use of antibiotics in both medicine and agriculture will have adverse effects on the environment and on human health. When animals and humans ingest medicines, up to 90 percent of active ingredients are excreted back into the environment. Many medicines are simply discarded -- in the United States alone an estimated one third of the four billion drugs prescribed each year ends up as waste. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) compared data on concentrations of pharmaceutical residue in water samples worldwide as well as prescribing trends and water purification regulations in various countries. One study cited in its report estimates that 10 percent of all pharmaceuticals are potentially harmful to the environment -- including hormones, painkillers and antidepressants. The OECD said that antibiotic use for livestock is predicted to rocket by more than two thirds in the next decade, stoking concerns over antibiotic resistance. Human prescriptions are also set to drastically increase, according to the report." We're seeing constant engineering of new pharmaceuticals and seeing clinical practices evolve to include recommendations of earlier treatment and higher doses," said the lead report author Hannah Leckie. Another study cited said "extremely high" concentrations of pharmaceutical products had already been detected in water ways in China, India, Israel, South Korea and the United States. In Britain alone, ethinyloestradiol, diclofenac, ibuprofen, propranolol and antibiotics are now present in the run-off of 890 wastewater treatment plants at high enough levels to cause "adverse environmental effects", according to another study." The residues of pharmaceuticals have been detected in surface and ground water across the world," said Leckie." However there's still a lot we don't know about their occurence, and know even less about the concentrations we find." More than 700,000 people already die each year from drug-resistant infections. As the global population grows and ages and prescribing rates continue to climb, that figure is set to hit 10 million annually by 2050 -- higher than the number of people dying from cancer." Unless adequate measures are taken to manage the risks, pharmaceutical residues will increasingly be released into the environment as ageing populations, advances in healthcare, and intensification of meat and fish production spur the demand for pharmaceuticals worldwide," the report said. And the situation is set to get even more acute as climate change increases the spread and frequency of infectious diseases such as malaria and dengue. Leckie said there was something of a vicious circle when it came to medical prescriptions and climate-related disease." Human activity such as population (growth) and transport combined with climate change increases antibacterial resistance... and therefore the need for more pharmaceuticals."	False

EPA seeks to scrap rule protecting drinking water for third of Americans The Environmental Protection Agency is poised to dismantle the federal clean water rule, which protects waterways that provide drinking water for about a third of the US population. The EPA, with the US army, has proposed scrapping the rule in order to conduct a "substantive re-evaluation" of which rivers, streams, wetlands and other bodies of water should be protected by the federal government." e are taking significant action to return power to the states and provide regulatory certainty to our nation's farmers and businesses," said Scott Pruitt, administrator of the EPA. Pruitt said the EPA would swiftly redefine clean water regulations in a "thoughtful, transparent and collaborative" way with other agencies and the public. Green groups, however, said the move pandered to fossil fuel and farming interests and was part of an agenda to weaken clean water protections." nce again, the Trump administration has agreed to do the bidding of the worst polluters in our country, and once again it's putting the health of American families and communities at risk," said Michael Brune, executive director of Sierra Club. "We will fight this and every other attempt by polluters and the Trump administration to destroy our water resources." The planned rollback follows an executive order penned by Donald Trump in February which called for a review of the regulation, also known as the waters of the United States rule, that was introduced by the Obama administration in 2015. The rule was meant to end years of confusion over which waterways were federally protected from pollution, with the clean water rule simply designating "navigable" waters for safeguards. The Obama administration widened this definition to include the drinking water of about 117 million Americans. But while the rule was applauded by environmentalists for improving drinking water protections and aiding wildlife that relies on wetlands, it was attacked by some farmers and golf course operators who claimed it hindered their ability to manage their land. Trump has called the rule "one of the worst examples of federal regulation" and a "massive power grab". Signing his order, the president said thousands of jobs were at risk because "the EPA decided that navigable waters can mean nearly every puddle or every ditch on a farmer's land or anyplace else that they decide". While "puddles" aren't mentioned in the rule, the EPA does have greater latitude to regulate under it. However, there is no evidence that the regulation could result in the loss of thousands of jobs. The National Mining Association, another opponent of the rule and representative of an industry relentlessly backed by Trump, welcomed its impending demise." his sets in motion a welcome correction to a deeply problematic regulation that ignored the careful balance that Congress struck between federal and state water regulation and constitutional limits on federal authority," said Hal Quinn, NMA president and chief executive. The clean water rule reversal, which will now go through a period of public comment ahead of a final decision, is the latest in a string of regulations to be paused or scrapped by the Trump administration. In recent months, the EPA has wound back rules curbing vehicle emissions, toxic waste from power plants and methane leaks from oil and gas drilling operations.	False

Farinato said she wants to follow the environmental rules on cleaning burned sites but needs to know what they are. (AP Photo/Ellen Knickmeyer)SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) — Government officials outlined plans Monday for what they say will be the largest fire clean-up in California history, aimed at removing hazardous substances and ash from 8,400 homes and other structures burned in Northern California wildfires. With hundreds of anxious homeowners listening, state emergency services official Eric Lamoureux set a target of early 2018 for completing the clean-up and allowing owners to start rebuilding. California has declared a public health emergency in the fire area, in part because of concern for hazardous substances ranging from freon in air-conditioners to asbestos in older homes. The fires that began Oct. 8 have killed at least 42 people, making them the deadliest series of wildfires in state history." The size and scope of this debris removal process will be one for the record books," Sen. Mike McGuire, a Democrat from the wine-country town of Healdsburg, told fire survivors at a Santa Rosa community forum. The meeting gave residents some of the first briefings on the clean-up to come. Authorities have warned residents returning to the ruins of their homes to beware of possible hazardous residues in the ashes, and required them to sign forms acknowledging the danger. Many survivors — at Monday's forum, and in fire zones where people are returning — say they are confused about what authorities will allow them to do at their blackened properties before the massive waste removal." How do you get to get your mourning started if I can't stop and put hands" on the scattering of possessions left, asked resident Joyce Farinato, who wore gardening gloves and a mask Monday as she walked through the chunks of concrete and bent metal that were all that was left of her home in rural Sonoma County."I'd like to know what's hazardous. What are we looking for?" Farinato said. In Santa Rosa, authorities with the Federal Emergency Management Administration and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers joined local and state officials answering other questions from homeowners. In two of the hardest-hit areas, Sonoma and Napa, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will be the agency that moves first, removing any hazardous materials from the thousands of sites, officials said Monday. State agencies would handle the same task in five other burned counties. The EPA effort would start this week, said Lamoureux, of California's Office of Emergency Services. Hundreds of teams led by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers are to move in next, removing ash and rubble. In Sonoma County, the scene of the most destruction and deaths, county officials will draft environmental standards to be followed by any homeowners who opt to handle the clean-up themselves, at their own expense, officials said. For property owners who let the government handle the clean-up, taxpayers will cover any of the costs of debris removal that insurance doesn't, Lamoureux said. Authorities have yet to put a price tag on the process. Homeowners shouted questions on matters ranging from their liability in the clean-up to the extent that contractors would be scraping bare building sites. Laney Wall, who lost her home in the Sonoma County community of Fountaingrove, asked why homeowners had to go through the expense, trouble and wait of the clean-up at all." What legally is the justification for declaring my home site a hazardous waste site, requiring this onerous process?" Wall asked. Officials pointed to the public health concerns, ranging from safety of residents in the burned neighborhoods to concerns for hazardous waste entering waterways and the air. Officials promised more town meetings. Homeowners said that was a good idea."I just have more questions now," Danny Thom, another Fountaingrove resident, said after the meeting.	False

Climate scientists continue to sound the alarm: Global warming fueled record temperatures in 2016 Scientists say that 2016 has been confirmed as the warmest year on record. (Photo: Getty/EyeEm)The evidence behind global climate change continues to mount, and scientists keep speaking out. Now they hope the world will listen. The latest international climate report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) confirms that 2016 was the third consecutive year of record global heat. On Thursday afternoon the American Meteorological Society published the 27th annual "State of the Climate" report, which verifies last year surpassed 2015 as the hottest since record keeping began in 1880. Based on preliminary data, NASA and NOOA had made the same assessment back in January, but this week's report is considered definitive." e're scientists, and we're providing objective information," Jessica Blunden, a climate scientist at NOAA's National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C., told Yahoo News. "We don't go into policy, but we provide the information for people who want to go further with that." According to the report, the effect of long-term global warming and a powerful El Niño early on pushed 2016 into record-setting warmth. The global average sea level reached a new record high last year as well, to 3.25 inches above the average level in 1993, which marks the beginning of the satellite altimeter record. Scientists also said that the average Arctic land surface temperature continued to warm and global ice and snow cover continued to decline. Sea ice extents in the Antarctic hit record daily and monthly lows in August and November. The "State of the Climate" report is based on contributions from nearly 500 scientists from more than 60 countries, using tens of thousands of measurements from several independent data sets. This summary of the global climate confirms data released on Jan. 18 based on analyses from scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. Blunden said the use of additional independent data sets distinguishes this report from what came before." he big difference in this report is we don't just look at NOAA data. There are about four different independent data sets we looked at to come to this conclusion," Blunden told Yahoo News. "It's not just NOAA who is agreeing with it. NASA, the U.K. Met Office and the Japan Meteorological Agency are agreeing." Since the previous data was released mere days before President Trump's inauguration, this peer-reviewed report is the most thorough assessment of climate change officially released during the Trump era. Deke Arndt, chief of the climate-monitoring branch at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, described the report as diagnostic when asked if anyone from the White House had weighed in on it or questioned its findings." his report is a diagnostic report. It basically diagnoses what is happening in the climate system," Arndt said on a conference call. "It's intended to provide intelligence to those sort of decision makers that you're talking about." Concentrations of major greenhouse gases in the atmosphere also reached to new highs in 2016. For instance, the global average concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2), the primary driver of anthropogenic climate change, in the atmosphere reached 402.9 parts per million (ppm). This was the first time on record that CO2 concentration exceeded 400 ppm. The consensus of climate scientists is that the maximum safe level is 350.	False

On Tuesday, some of the Republicans in hiding were not sure what to make of Courtney's statement about the votes.	"The Republicans are not standing against climate change, they're standing against democracy," she said during a press conference Tuesday.	Democrats have conceded to Republican walkouts before, yielding on major gun control and vaccine legislation.		Oregon Republicans are in hiding to avoid voting on a climate bill. They might succeed. A top Oregon Senate Democrat on Tuesday flinched in the face of a Republican walkout, acknowledging that there are not enough votes to pass a major bill to address climate change." ouse Bill 2020 does not have the votes on the Senate floor," said Senate President Peter Courtney Tuesday morning in an admission of defeat. "That will not change." The central provision of House Bill 2020 is to institute a cap-and-trade mechanism for carbon dioxide across the state — a mechanism to cut emissions 45 percent below 1990 levels by 2035 and 80 percent by 2050. It's a long, thorough piece of legislation that mandates carbon emission reductions across the state's economy while accounting for job quality standards and economic equity. And it would make Oregon the second state after New York with a legally binding, economy-wide greenhouse gas reduction target. "There's been incredible work going into that bill," Courtney said. But according to Rick Osborn, communications director for the Oregon Senate Majority office, Democrats weren't able to muster the votes for HB 2020 within their own caucus. Oregon Republicans argued that the bill would harm their rural constituents and energy-intensive industries like cement production. They also said they were being bullied by Senate Democrats. And so 11 of them fled the state capitol on Thursday, apparently to an undisclosed location in Idaho, to deny quorum for a vote on the bill. Yet the walkout now appears to have been a highly politicized charade, since Democrats may not have had the votes to begin with. "My understanding is that it was known last week, before the Republicans walked out," Osborn told Vox. "[Courtney's admission] is not rewarding Senate Republicans for bad behavior." Democratic Gov. Kate Brown nonetheless last week sent state police to find the lawmakers and instituted a $500-per-day fine per person for each day they weren't present at a legislative session. "The Republicans are not standing against climate change, they're standing against democracy," she said during a press conference Tuesday. Republicans had used the moment as an opportunity to appear defiant, with one Republican state senator, Brian Boquist, even threatening police. Lawmakers closed down the capitol on Saturday after receiving credible threats from militia groups in favor of the Republican walkout. On Tuesday, some of the Republicans in hiding were not sure what to make of Courtney's statement about the votes. And they weren't committing to returning to work either, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting's Lauren Dake:Even if Courtney wants to throw in the towel, it may not be easy to kill the climate change bill to bring Republicans back to Salem, as the Oregonian explained:Although Courtney wields significant power in the Senate, he cannot easily kill the climate bill in order to secure Republicans' return. One possible first step could be for the Senate to vote to send the bill back to a committee but such a vote could not happen without a quorum, meaning at least two Republicans would have to return to the Capitol. Another option that would also require a quorum could be a motion to postpone the bill indefinitely, which under Senate rules would mean the bill could not be considered during this legislative session. If and when the bill dies, it would be a painful defeat for Democrats, who won legislative supermajorities in both chambers of the Oregon legislature in the last election. Oregon has also been working on carbon pricing policies since 1997. The concession from Democrats may have been motivated by a time constraint. The Oregon state legislative session ends on June 30, and more than 100 bills, including funding for several state agencies, are at risk of being scrapped. Democrats have conceded to Republican walkouts before, yielding on major gun control and vaccine legislation. This latest surrender likely means that state Republicans, despite being in the minority, will continue to hold a veto over Democrats' agenda.	False

Amazon fires: Brazil to reject G7 offer of $22m aid Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has ruled out accepting a G7 offer of aid to fight fires in the Amazon rainforest unless he gets an apology from his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron. Mr Bolsonaro said the French leader should apologise for insulting him personally by calling him a liar. Mr Macron had accused him of "lying" about fighting climate change. Aid worth $22m (£18m) was announced by Mr Macron at a summit in France of the seven leading industrial powers. Satellite data show a record number of fires burning in Brazil, most of them in the Amazon region. Earlier, Brazilian ministers said the G7 money was not needed and they accused foreign powers of wanting control of the Amazon. Last week, Mr Macron said Mr Bolsonaro had "lied" to him at a G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, in June by failing to respect his climate commitments and by failing to pursue biodiversity. Mr Macron said France would not ratify a huge trade deal with South American nations unless Brazil did more to fight fires in the Amazon. On Tuesday, Mr Bolsonaro told reporters in the capital Brasilia: "Mr Macron must withdraw the insults that he made to my person. Firstly, he called me a liar." He also accused Mr Macron of questioning Brazilian sovereignty over the Amazon region, Brazilian news website G1 reports." To talk or to accept anything from France, whether it be with the best possible intentions, he [Mr Macron] will have to withdraw those words and then we can talk," he said. The two presidents hold sharply different political views, with Mr Bolsonaro hailing from the far right in Brazil and Mr Macron elected in a run-off against the far right in France. In another development, Mr Bolsonaro responded to a joke on Facebook mocking the age of Mr Macron's wife Brigitte who, at 65, is 25 years his senior. He wrote: "Do not humiliate the guy, ha ha." Asked about Mr Bolsonaro's remarks, Mr Macron said they were "extraordinarily rude" and "sad". Adding to the row over the aid offer, Mr Bolsonaro's chief of staff, Onyx Lorenzoni, mocked the fire that ravaged Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris in April." Macron cannot even avoid a predictable fire in a church that is part of the world's heritage and he wants to give us lessons for our country?" he said, quoted by the Globo news website. As the largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. It spans a number of countries, but the majority of it falls within Brazil. Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil but satellite data published by Brazil's space agency show an increase of 80% this year. BBC analysis has also found that the record number of fires being recorded coincides with a sharp drop in fines being handed out for environmental violations. Mr Bolsonaro has previously said his government lacks the resources to fight the record number of fires in the Amazon region but his government is also being accused of slashing funding for environmental protection." The funding for Brazil's environment agency has gone down by 95% this year," Yadvinder Malhi, professor of Ecosystem Science at the University of Oxford, told the BBC's Today programme. On Friday, President Bolsonaro authorised the military to help tackle the blazes. Brazil says 44,000 soldiers have been deployed to combat the fires and environmental crimes in the Amazon, and military operations are under way in seven states as the result of requests for assistance from local governments. Jorgimar Alberto, from Roraima, one of the states most affected by the fires, has seen the burning of most of the land surrounding his wooden house." It's a risky situation, we have lots of crops here and everything is burning, such as the cashew trees," he told the BBC."I even had to keep the animals [inside] so that they don't burn as well. Every year it is the same, these fires are disturbing the region a lot." Environmental officials helped him extinguish the fires last week only for them to reignite, he said. His wife could not stand staying in the house with the smell of burning and the threat getting ever closer, so she left. Lumberyard owner Edson Oliveira from southern Amazonas said he did not believe the media coverage about the Amazon." In my opinion, the parts that are burning are the same that burn every year," he told the BBC. Asked what he would like politicians to do for the Amazon, he said that he would like "economic alternatives for people here, to find a way we can make use of the natural wealth we have here"." It's no use pointing the finger at what's wrong without bringing alternatives to people," he said. The $22m was announced on Monday as the leaders of the G7 - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - met in Biarritz, France. Mr Macron said the funds would be made available immediately - primarily to pay for more firefighting planes - and that France would also "offer concrete support with military in the region". Greenpeace France described the G7's response to the crisis as "inadequate given the urgency and magnitude of this environmental disaster". As international concern over the fires spread, Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio pledged $5m towards helping the rainforest. He has long maintained that European countries are trying to gain access to Brazil's natural resources. He alleges that European interest in the welfare of the Amazon is a thin guise for attempts to gain a foothold in the region. Asked by international journalists about environmental protection of the Amazon at a press briefing on 6 July, he said: "Brazil is like a virgin that every pervert from the outside lusts for."	False

Even as nations are gathering in Poland this week to discuss how to implement the Paris climate agreement, the US delegation plans to host a panel touting the virtues of fossil fuels, the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change."	t's nothing burger," he said.	And coal consumption is at its lowest level since 1979.		The EPA plans to lift greenhouse gas limits on coal power plants The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to roll back more regulations on coal-fired power plants Thursday. It's a striking move for two big reasons: No new coal plants are being built in the US, and the EPA itself (along with 12 other federal agencies) recently put out a sweeping report detailing the need to reduce emissions from fossil fuels because of the grave threat of climate change. Axios reported this week that on Thursday afternoon the agency will announce its intent to loosen Obama-era restrictions on how much carbon dioxide new coal power plants can emit. Known as the New Source Performance Standards, a provision under the Clean Air Act, the rule established in 2015 said coal plants couldn't emit more than 1,400 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour. This would have likely required new coal plants to install carbon capture technologies to limit some of their emissions. But the coal industry argued in court that these technologies are too expensive and immature to deploy at scale, so the new standard is too difficult to meet. The lawsuit against the New Source Performance Standard was suspended once the EPA announced last year that it was looking to revise the rule. According to the New York Times, the EPA wants to relax the limit to 1,900 pounds of CO2 per MWh. These weaker standards come after an EPA proposal in August to replace another Obama regulation, the Clean Power Plan, which targets existing power plants. The replacement, the Affordable Clean Energy rule, would lead to 1,400 additional premature deaths each year by 2030, according to EPA's own calculations. Weakening pollution rules for existing and new coal-fired power plants is part of the Trump Administration's strategy to resurrect the decrepit US coal industry, which has been shrinking and hemorrhaging jobs for decades. But it's not regulations that are hurting the US coal industry; it's competition. Natural gas and renewables are increasingly cheaper than coal. With energy demand projected to stay level, that means it's coal that's going to yield. However, the Trump's policies stand to slow the transition toward cleaner sources of energy at a time when scientists are warning that the world may have as little as 12 years to act to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius since the industrial revolution. Even as nations are gathering in Poland this week to discuss how to implement the Paris climate agreement, the US delegation plans to host a panel touting the virtues of fossil fuels, the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change." The rollback]'s an international signal that we're not taking carbon capture and sequestration and reducing impacts from coal seriously," said Jay Duffy, an associate attorney at the Clean Air Task Force. As we've pointed out over and over again, the coal industry in the United States has been floundering for years, and there's little Trump can do to stop it. In 2018 alone, 20 coal-fired power plants have closed or are scheduled to shut down. Overall coal power generation capacity has fallen by one-third since 2010. And coal consumption is at its lowest level since 1979. Meanwhile coal mining jobs have cratered from a high of more than 800,000 in the 1920s to roughly 76,000 today. The EPA's latest proposal only affects new coal power plants. The last new coal plant to come online in the US was the 600-megawatt John W. Turk, Jr. Power Plant in Arkansas back in 2012. It's actually one of the most high-tech, most efficient coal power plants in the country. But with a $1.8 billion price tag, it was the most expensive project in Arkansas history. Duffy pointed out that the Turk plant emits about 1,725 pounds of CO2 per megawatt hour, so it's already beating the EPA's proposed benchmarks. It's likely that with current technology, any hypothetical new coal power plant would have to do almost nothing to cut its greenhouse gas emissions, rendering the new regulation meaningless." t's nothing burger," he said. "It's a no-standard standard." Yet coal plants are closing everywhere, and no new ones are even on the drawing board. In fact, environmental groups can't even sue to block the proposal at this point, since there is no plant in the works that could potentially violate the Obama-era greenhouse gas limits. No harm, no foul. However, environmental groups are ready to litigate if the proposal becomes finalized. Where this proposal could make a difference is in extending the lives of existing plants, Duffy explained. There's a quirk in EPA regulations that says that if you modify an existing coal plant enough, it can be considered as a new plant. So in theory, an aging power plant could get some upgrades that would extend its operating life but would also allow it to be held to the weaker greenhouse gas limit. Taken in tandem with all of the other Trump proposals to boost coal — relaxed rules on stream protection, coal ash, and mercury — as well as curbing incentives for clean energy, it adds up to a prolonging of the steady demise of coal power in the United States. Correction: An earlier version of this story said that environmental groups could not sue to block the EPA's latest New Source Performance Standard rule. Groups can sue once the proposal is finalized as a rule. However, they can't sue while the rule is in the proposal stage and there are no power plants seeking to implement the proposal.	False

EPA Nominee Andrew Wheeler Downplays Climate Threat At Testy Confirmation Hearing He refused to call the rapid warming of the planet a crisis. He repeatedly misrepresented his own agency's findings about a rule to gut an Obama-era power plant regulation, inflating the emissions cuts the new proposal would mandate. He even mixed up two of the most important climate science reports to come out in the last three months, admitting he hadn't fully read the report co-authored by researchers at his own agency. It was a brazen if not unexpected stance from the nominee to become the EPA's 15th administrator. Wheeler isn't new to the job: Last month, he became the longest-serving acting chief in the agency's history, having taken over in July when former Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in disgrace amid mounting scandals. In November 2017, when he appeared before the Senate environment and public works committee to interview for the EPA's No. 2 job, Wheeler said he believed "that man has an impact on the climate, but what's not completely understood is what the impact is." In October, the United Nations released a landmark determination that the world has until 2030 to halve global emissions or face catastrophic climate change. A month later, the federal government's National Climate Assessment ― a congressionally mandated report issued by 13 agencies, including the EPA ― confirmed the findings and warned of cataclysmic damage to the United States economy and human health and "by 9°F (5°C) or more by the end of this century." During Wednesday's hearing, Wheeler initially mistook the United Nations report for the National Climate Assessment. Asked about the latter, he said he "did not review the report before it came out," and that he held just one briefing meeting with his career staffers. He said the partial federal government shutdown, now its fourth week, forced him to delay future briefings. Wheeler dismissed the report this month that found U.S. emissions rose 3.4 percent last year, blaming the jump on a manufacturing and industrial surge triggered by the Trump administration's deregulatory effort. But he claimed his proposals to dramatically weaken emissions rules for vehicles and power plants ― the largest and second largest sources of climate pollution, respectively ― would provide reductions in line with the Obama-era regulations they aim to replace. When pressed about the need to cut emissions, Wheeler returned to a certain statistic over and over again, stating that the Affordable Clean Energy rule he proposed in August would deliver carbon dioxide reductions 34 percent below 2005 levels, compared to the 33 to 35 percent the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan would have provided. This is a fudged statistic, however. The EPA's own analysis shows the so-called ACE rule would actually increase CO2 emissions by 20 to 61 million tons, nitrous oxide by 14,000 to 43,000 tons and sulfur dioxide by 29,000 to 53,000 tons. Those increases are expected to cause up to 1,400 premature deaths per year by 2030. Wheeler's climate denial received some backup at Wednesday's hearing. Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), who once infamously brought a snowball to the Senate floor to "debunk" climate change, submitted rebuttals to climate science reports from right-wing think tanks such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute and the Cato Institute, both of which are funded by the fossil-fuel billionaire Koch brothers. Wheeler blamed the shutdown for the delay in releasing a plan to deal with toxic perfluorinated substances in drinking water. Over the past few years, the chemicals, known as PFAS and linked to cancer and thyroid disease, have been found in water sources across the country. Wheeler, however, declined to commit to a two-year deadline for setting a drinking water standard for PFAS. Republican senators praised Wheeler's proposal to replace another Obama-era rule that sought to safeguard drinking water for millions of Americans by extending federal protections to 2 million miles of streams and 20 million acres of wetlands. Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) even prompted Wheeler with a question about his nearly two decades working for Bob Murray, the influential and bombastic baron who runs the nation's largest privately owned coal company. Wheeler used his response to note that the last four years of his time working for Murray were spent advocating for miners' pensions. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) brought out some visual aids to question Wheeler further about his relationship with Murray ― including a poster-sized printout of a photo leaked from a March 2017 meeting between Murray and Energy Secretary Rick Perry, where the coal executive provided a detailed wish list of policies to the administration. That meeting ended, as another photo showed, with a hug between Perry and Murray. Wheeler is seen sitting beside Murray in the picture.	False

That's "an important distinction, because it means it's insulated from changes in the ocean's temperature."		Antarctica Has Lost More Than 3 Trillion Tons Of Ice In 25 Years Antarctica Has Lost More Than 3 Trillion Tons Of Ice In 25 YearsScientists have completed the most exhaustive assessment of changes in Antarctica's ice sheet to date. And they found that it's melting faster than they thought. Ice losses totaling 3 trillion tonnes (or more than 3.3 trillion tons) since 1992 have caused global sea levels to rise by 7.6 mm, nearly one third of an inch, according to a study published in Nature on Wednesday. Before 2010, Antarctica was contributing a relatively small proportion of the melting that is causing global sea levels to rise, says study co-leader Andrew Shepherd of the University of Leeds. But that has changed. "Since around 2010, 2012, we can see that there's been a sharp increase in the rate of ice loss from Antarctica. And the ice sheet is now losing three times as much ice," Shepherd adds. The annual sea level rise that's attributed to Antarctica has tripled, from 0.2mm to 0.6mm, he says." That's a big jump, and it did catch us all by surprise," Shepherd says. The melting is caused by rising ocean temperatures due to climate change. Shepherd says they've seen the most dramatic effects in West Antarctica, where the ice sheet rests on the sea bed. "When we look into the ocean we find that it's too warm and the ice sheet can't withstand the temperatures that are surrounding it in the sea," he says. That's causing glaciers to flow more quickly into the sea. East Antarctica, which is home to the South Pole, has seen considerably less melting because most of its ice is above sea level. That's "an important distinction, because it means it's insulated from changes in the ocean's temperature." This assessment, conducted by 84 scientists from 44 international organizations, is known as the Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-comparison Exercise (IMBIE). There have been many other estimates of how much ice has melted in Antarctica. And many of those papers showed different results." Some of the estimates covered different proportions of the ice sheets, some of them covered different time periods, and all of them used different methods and so it became difficult for people who are not specialists to try to pick them apart," says Shepherd. "So that was the motivation for originally setting up the project." The scientists combined 24 different satellite surveys, which Shepherd says provides a more complete picture of the overall ice sheet change than previous studies. "We believe that we've captured all of the different satellite records that exist on the planet," he says. To analyze the ice, the researchers use three different kinds of measurements. Satellite altimeters measure the height of the ice sheets, to see how much they are thinning or thickening over time. Another measurement records the speed of the glaciers and how they're moving into the ocean. Finally, the scientists are recording gravity measurements for Antarctica. These "tell us about changes in the earth's gravitational attraction over time and that can be related to the mass of the ice sheets overall," Shepherd says, "and they are really powerful measurements because they can add up everything across Antarctica." So what accounts for the apparent three-fold speed up in Antarctica's melting in the last five years?Shepherd says that actually, their data shows a "a progressive increase in ice loss throughout the whole 25 year time period." However, a period of heavy snowfall between 2005 and 2010 masked some of the immediate effects of the ice loss, accounting for the sudden, steep increase in more recent years. This new data creates a much starker picture of the future than previous estimates. Shepherd says until 2010, the data had been tracking a lower scenario which estimated that Antarctica "wouldn't make much of a contribution to sea level rise at all" because of the effects of higher snowfall. However, he says that now the data is tracking a higher scenario, which could mean nearly 6 inches of additional sea level rise in the next century. That could be a big deal, he says, "for anybody who lives, works and governs a coastal region." Understanding the rate of Antarctica's melting is crucial for these communities. If all of the ice in Antarctica melted, global sea levels would rise by more than 190 feet.	False

Prince Harry defends use of private jets: 'It's to keep my family safe' The Duke of Sussex has defended his use of private jets, saying he occasionally needs to ensure his family is safe. Speaking at the launch of an eco-tourism project in Amsterdam, Prince Harry added that he balances out the impact this has on the environment. The duke and his wife Meghan have faced criticism after newspapers claimed they flew privately four times in 11 days this summer. Prince Harry said he flew to the event on Tuesday commercially. At the launch of Travalyst, aimed at encouraging the tourism industry to become more sustainable, the duke was asked about his travel behaviour."I came here by commercial. I spend 99% of my life travelling the world by commercial," he said." Occasionally there needs to be an opportunity based on a unique circumstance to ensure that my family are safe - it's generally as simple as that." During his opening speech, the duke said "no one is perfect" in terms of his impact on the environment. Questions have been asked about the royal couple's use of private jets and their impact following their support of environmental causes. Prince Harry has previously spoken about the importance of tackling climate change. In September's edition of Vogue - edited by Meghan - the prince spoke about environmental issues and his love for nature, saying: "We are the one species on this planet that seems to think that this place belongs to us, and only us." The Sussexes came under fire over the summer after taking a private flight to the home of singer Sir Elton John, in Nice. Sir Elton defended the royal couple, saying he provided them with his private plane to "maintain a high level of much-needed protection". He also said he paid to carbon offset their trip to his French home. Carbon offsetting allows passengers to pay extra to help compensate for the carbon emissions produced from their flights. The money is then invested in environmental projects - such as planting trees or installing solar panels - which reduce carbon dioxide in the air by the same amount. The duke said that what is important is "what we do to balance out" negative effects. He went on to say that he has always offset his carbon emissions and will continue to do so." In my mind it's the right thing to do and we need to make it cool," he said." We have to connect people to where that little bit of extra money is actually going." Prince Harry has spent three years working on the project alongside five co-founders - Booking. com, Ctrip, Skyscanner, TripAdvisor and Visa. He hopes it will improve conservation, environmental protection and help increase the economic benefits of tourism for local communities. Figures from accounts published in June show the royal household's carbon emissions due to business travel almost doubled last year. The increase was put down to the use of chartered flights for more overseas visits, which are planned by the Foreign Office. However, emissions savings from greener heating and lighting meant the household's overall carbon footprint stayed around the same as the previous year.	False

Bolt says the environment ranks among the top three issues for its members.	"Small, incremental policy solutions are not enough."	"The Green New Deal will put the health and well-being of our communities first," Grijalva said.	In a statement to CBS News on Tuesday, Congressman Raúl Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, confirmed that he will be supporting the resolution, after initially being reluctant to back it.		Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez introduces 2020 policy test with Green New Deal Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez isn't old enough to run for president. But the freshman congresswoman from New York introduced a Green New Deal resolution on Thursday that is already emerging as a key policy test for 2020 Democratic candidates." Our first step is to define the problem and define the scope of the solution," Ocasio-Cortez told reporters during a Thursday afternoon press conference for her newly-introduced proposal, which was quickly backed by Democratic presidential hopefuls Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker. "Small, incremental policy solutions are not enough." Several contenders vying for the Democatic nomination have expressed support for the underlying principles of the sweeping resolution to combat climate change, and activist groups energized by the November midterm election wins have been pressuring candidates to sign on as co-sponsors." We are going to be pressuring all the 2020 contenders, especially the senators, to co-sponsor the bill," Stephen O'Hanlon, a spokesperson for the Sunrise Movement, a climate change group that staged a high-profile sit-in in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office in November which Ocasio-Cortez attended, told CBS News. "It will make clear who is just using it as a buzzword and who is taking it seriously." Progressive activists are "extremely supportive of the Green New Deal and think of it as the gold standard plan on climate, and expect their presidential candidates to be treating it as such," said Chad Bolt, associate policy director of Indivisible, a grassroots resistance group. Bolt says the environment ranks among the top three issues for its members. The resolution introduced by Ocasio-Cortez and Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, a Democrat, is broad and light on specifics, and seen more as a roadmap for overhauling the economy than a concrete piece of legislation. The resolution includes plans to decarbonize the economy, reduce greenhouse gases, make sure low-income and minority communities benefit, create a federal jobs guarantee, provide universal health care and make investments in infrastructure. The Green New Deal proposal is named after President Franklin Roosevelt's sweeping "New Deal" economic and labor reforms during the Great Depression. It's aimed a transforming the American economy by ending its dependence on fossil fuels, investing heavily in renewable energy like solar and wind and sparking large-scale job-creation. Some proposals have set the goal to converting the entire U.S. economy to renewable energy within 12 years and eliminating the carbon footprint by 2030. The lack of specifics could present opportunities and liabilities for presidential candidates. On one hand, it becomes a kind of "catch-all" way to talk about the environment, jobs and economic fairness, issues at the forefront of the party's primary. But on the other, it could put candidates in a difficult position when pressed on the costs and impact on certain jobs and industries. The debate over Medicare-for-All has already shown the kinds of risks and rewards candidates face. Republicans have branded the proposal as a costly fringe policy goal, and many centrist Democrats have not backed the initiative. Pelosi referred to it Thursday morning as a "suggestion" and the "green dream." It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive," Pelosi told Politico in an interview. "The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they're for it right?"Later in the morning, Pelosi said she had not seen the proposal. "I do know its enthusiastic and I welcome all the enthusiasm that is out there," she told reporters during her weekly press conference. Pelosi also named the nine Democratic members of the new Select Committee on the Climate Crisis — and notably left Ocasio-Cortez off the list. The New York Democrat said Pelosi offered her a spot, but she declined it because she wanted to focus on the "legislative" side of climate policy. Despite some hesitation within the party, the Democratic base sees the proposal as a way for its leaders to capitalize on their new power in Washington. In a statement to CBS News on Tuesday, Congressman Raúl Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, confirmed that he will be supporting the resolution, after initially being reluctant to back it. "The Green New Deal will put the health and well-being of our communities first," Grijalva said. Its aspirational goals will help our country combat climate change through clean and renewable energy, create millions of new jobs in the process, and safeguard our environment for generations to come." Most of the Democratic presidential candidates have also broadly endorsed the idea behind the Green New Deal. Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, who's mulling a presidential bid, said the issue should be an integral part of his party's agenda going forward. On CBSN's "Red and Blue," Merkley outlined what he believes should be the key components of a comprehensive Green New Deal." The core objectives are some things such as let's drive a fast transition from fossil fuel, carbon transmission creating energy sources to renewable energy so that we save our planet. Second principle is, let's create tens of millions of jobs as we renovate our energy economy," he said Tuesday.  "A third principle — a just transition for fossil fuel workers so that no one is left behind and so we show respect and gratitude for all the work they've done to power economy is the decades past."

Right-wing populism today centers on a particular kind of chauvinistic nationalism — an "America First" style obsession with the importance of their (typically ethnically defined) home nation and its independence from international institutions.		The right-wing populist wave is a threat to the climate The Amazon rainforest is on fire — and the consensus is that Brazil's far-right populist leader, Jair Bolsonaro, is to blame. Bolsonaro, who took office in January and has been referred to as "Captain Chainsaw," gutted funding for agencies protecting the massive rainforest, essentially giving wink-and-nudge approval for illegal loggers to do their thing. Fire is used as a tool for clearing Amazon land for ranching, and the more trees are cut down, the more vulnerable the rainforest is to wildfires. There have been almost twice as many fires detected in 2019 so far as there were in the entirety of 2018. It's hard to overstate how threatening this policy is to the climate. The Amazon is the world's largest rainforest: its trees scrub the Earth of a significant amount of CO2 and have captured a huge amount of carbon and methane within their branches and roots. If you lose the trees, a lot of greenhouse gases get released and it becomes harder to capture emissions from other sources. Continued fires and clear-cutting in the Amazon could cripple the fight against climate change. All of this goes to underscore an important and poorly understood point: The wave of right-wing populism sweeping the world is not only dangerous for the countries who succumb to it, or even to immigrants wishing to move to those nations. It's a fundamental threat to progress against climate change — and thus the entirety of the human race. Bolsonaro has been dubbed the "Trump of the Tropics," a far-right firebrand who shares the American president's hostility to democracy and penchant for saying extremely offensive things about women and minorities. The similarities clearly extend to climate policy — Trump famously labeled climate change a Chinese hoax, pulled out of the Paris agreement on climate change, and recently presented a "carbon regulation" plan that could actually increase emissions. The American and Brazilian leaders are particularly aggressive on the issue, but they're hardly alone among Western right-wingers. A February report from the German Adelphi Institute, an environmental think tank, found that 18 out of the 21 largest European far-right parties are either generally indifferent to climate action or outright oppose it. Nigel Farage, the leader of Britain's Brexit party, recently called climate change a "scam" during an interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Germany's Alternatives for Deutschland (AfD) claims in its most recent electoral platform that "CO2 is not a pollutant, but an indispensable component of all life." By contrast, the centrist and left parties in these countries were, prior to the populist wave of the past few years, doing a markedly better job on addressing climate change — not perfect or sufficient, mind you, but comparatively much better than what the far-right parties want. Between 2003-2011, a left-wing Brazilian government managed to cut Amazon deforestation rates by 80 percent. Obama massively boosted the American renewables industry via the 2009 stimulus, helped negotiate the Paris Climate Accord, and implemented the Clean Power Plan to cut emissions from US power plants. In 2005, the EU put in place the world's first major emissions permit and trading system (the European Union Emissions Trading System, or EU ETS). So there's a clear contrast between the right-wing populists on the one hand and their leading opponents on the other. Right-wing populism today centers on a particular kind of chauvinistic nationalism — an "America First" style obsession with the importance of their (typically ethnically defined) home nation and its independence from international institutions. European populists hate the European Union, with its open-borders approach to immigration and transnational economic regulations; both Trump and Bolsonaro have insulted international institutions and withdrawn from global agreements. This brand of populism poses a particular challenge for the effort against climate change. It's a global issue that no one country can solve on its own; it requires collective action, negotiated through some forum like the Paris Climate Agreement. It's a paradigmatic example of the limits of nationalism and the need for organizations like the UN and EU. You can't propose an effective solution to a transnational problem through a narrowly nationalist framework, and yet the nationalists are here attacking both climate policies in their own country and the very idea of global governance itself. This is a crucial time; a recent UN report claims we have 11 years to prevent "irreversible damage" from climate change. Large population centers like the United States, Brazil, and the EU as a bloc are responsible for a major chunk of emissions. It's especially important that wealthy countries take the lead on the issue. Poorer countries are less likely to act when they think they're unfairly bearing the burden of a problem kickstarted by Western industrial development. Backsliding in the US and Europe hurts climate action everywhere. Right-wing populists are often framed as a threat to Western democracy — and they certainly are that. But the stakes are even bigger than they appear at first glance: It's not just the survival of Western democracy that's at stake, but the planet itself.	True

But, he said, at the time natural gas was described as a "bridge fuel" to help wean the country off coal and toward cleaner fuels." e're coming to the end of the bridge," Mr. Castro said. He said while he isn't calling for an immediate national ban on fracking, he supports local communities that do so and called for moving to cleaner sources. Mr. Castro won some of his strongest applause when he leaned into his résumé as the nation's housing chief and connected his work with the need to protect low-income communities from environmental damages. He recounted discovering that 70 percent of subsidized housing was within a mile of a superfund site saying, "That's the environmental injustice of racism that we're dealing with."	False

Global Warming: Britain Braces for 'Coldest Winter in 30 Years' Yahoo News reported Saturday that temperatures in Great Britain could reach as low as -14C with "snow event after snow event" expected to hit various parts of the territory. Forecasters expect the lasting cold spell to begin sometime this month and to continue at least through March." ctober is now looking like it will turn out to be colder than average with more of a chance of something wintery setting in through the second half of the month," according to Exacta Weather forecaster James Madden." here is a strong chance of widespread frosts and the chance of snowfall which will set the scene for November," Madden said. ""This will pave the way for what is shaping up to be a colder than average winter with some extreme cold weather events." Snow events have been few and far between in recent years, but this winter is looking favourable to bring snow event after snow event as weather systems from the Atlantic clash with cold stagnated air over the UK," he said. Current sea temperatures combined with a weather system over the north Atlantic suggest that "a freezing vortex of Arctic air could hit the country" later this month, Yahoo's Victoria Bell reported. The system will presumably descend from the North Pole ushering in a swath of low pressure spanning from Greenland to the northwest coast of Ireland. In the estimation of some meteorologists, the 2019-2020 cold spell will rival the bitter winter of 1963, believed to have been the coldest in 200 years. Other weather-watchers are less confident that this winter will be a record-breaker. Mark Saunders, for example, Professor of Climate Prediction at UCL, claims that there is only a 57 percent probability that this winter will be colder than last year's. Late last month, a group of over 500 scientists and climate professionals sent a "European Climate Declaration" to the Secretary-General of the United Nations appealing for an open debate on climate change." limate science should be less political, while climate policies should be more scientific," the declaration stated. "Scientists should openly address the uncertainties and exaggerations in their predictions of global warming, while politicians should dispassionately count the real benefits as well as the imagined costs of adaptation to global warming, and the real costs as well as the imagined benefits of mitigation." There is no statistical evidence that global warming is intensifying hurricanes, floods, droughts and suchlike natural disasters, or making them more frequent," they continued. The declaration's signers insisted that public policy must respect scientific and economic realities and not just reflect the most fashionable trend of the day." here is no climate emergency. Therefore, there is no cause for panic and alarm," they noted. "We strongly oppose the harmful and unrealistic net-zero CO2 policy proposed for 2050." No matter what the winter shapes up to be, there is a 100 percent probability that climate alarmists will find some way to attribute the weather to global warming and carbon dioxide emissions.	False

Activists Press Congress to Help Black Communities Fight Climate Change Advocates of man-made climate change believe that it causes strong storms, rising tides, and hot temperatures, and that black communities are disproportionately hurt by the effects of "global warming." That was the topic at a recent roundtable discussion in Washington, DC, where Bloomberg Environment reported that activists at the event said Congress needed to take action." eople of color have always been on the front line of this movement," Alaina Beverly, a former Obama White House urban affairs official who is now vice president for urban affairs at the University of Chicago's Office of Federal Relations in Washington, said at the event. "We're hit first and hit worst." This is our issue," Beverly said. Bloomberg Environment reported on how blacks are allegedly suffering from climate change-related hardships:Most of the worst effects of climate change are hitting—and lingering in—poor black neighborhoods in the South, according to the Rev. Leo Woodberry, executive director of the New Alpha Community Development Corporation in Florence, S.C. In coastal South Carolina, for example, residents in largely black towns have been told they won't be eligible for flood insurance if they don't elevate their homes; but a survey of local engineering groups showed the cost starts at $20,000 for a 900-square-foot house, Woodberry said. In New York City, many residents who die from heat stroke are African American, Peggy Shepard, executive director of West Harlem Environmental Action Inc., also known as WE ACT for Environmental Justice, said at a Sept. 12 roundtable hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, where Beverly and Woodberry also spoke." his is about social disruption," Shepard said. "Extreme heat is killing thousands every year." Bloomberg Environment cited a University of California at Berkeley study that said blacks are 52 percent more likely than whites to live in so-called "urban heat islands," where the sun beams down on brick, concrete and asphalt." here's no question that this is a topic area that black politicians, including the CBC [Congressional Black Caucus], have not focused on as much," Thomas A. LaVeist, dean of Tulane University's School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, said in an interview. "And I think it's because the stereotype is that the environment is about tree hugging or saving exotic birds." Members of the Congressional Black Caucus say they've heard the call and are working on solutions," Bloomberg Environment reported. "The caucus is made up of 55 African American members of the House and Senate." I think we're going to be energetic in supporting any legislation that is aimed at improving the environment, but I also have to tell you how congested the major issues have become," Rep. Emanuel Cleaver (D-MO) said in the Bloomberg Environment article. Cleaver said lawmakers could add language to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) budget to put resources in poor black communities, and the National Flood Insurance Program could add more protections for black communities. Bloomberg Environment reported that some are already putting out legislation with this goal in mind, including Reps. Maxine Waters (D-CA), Raul Grijalva (D-AZ) and A. Donald McEachin (D-VA)." or African Americans and people living in urban poor communities, it provides them with an empowerment tool to enforce the law, to demand action, and to try to get remediation done," Grijalva told Bloomberg Environment." eparately, Rep. Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), chairwoman of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, is working on a climate bill to be rolled out in March that, among other things, will aim to help communities of color living near pollution sources," Bloomberg Environment reported. "Many House Democrats think there's value in putting these measures up for a vote, even if they have little chance in the Senate now, to send a message." The article also quoted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) about her Green New Deal resolution that puts social justice even above climate change."  think it's backwards and shortsighted to say, 'Well, let's just throw a bunch of solar panels on everyone's roof and call it a day,'" Ocasio-Cortez said.

Climate change: COP25 island nation in 'fight to death' The president of an island nation on the frontline of climate change says it is in a "fight to the death" after freak waves inundated the capital. Powerful swells averaging 5m (16ft) washed across the capital of the Marshall Islands, Majuro, last week. But President Hilda Heine said the Pacific nation had been fighting rising tides even before last week's disaster. Political leaders and climate diplomats are meeting in Madrid for two weeks of talks amid a growing sense of crisis. This conference of the parties, or COP25, was due to be held in Chile but was cancelled by the government due to weeks of civil disturbances. Spain then stepped in to host the event, which will see 29,000 attendees over the two weeks of talks.• Climate change: Where we are in seven chartsThe world's average surface temperature is rising rapidly because human activities release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, a bit like the glass roof of a greenhouse. At the meeting, Ms Heine commented: "Water covers much of our land at one or other point of the year as we fight rising tides. As we speak hundreds of people have evacuated their homes after large waves caused the ocean to inundate parts of our capital in Majuro last week." She added: "It's a fight to the death for anyone not prepared to flee. As a nation we refuse to flee. But we also refuse to die." Ms Heine is not alone in the view that small nations like the Marshall Islands face an imminent existential threat. At the Madrid summit, ambassador Lois Young, from the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), which represents low-lying coastal countries and small island nations, launched a rebuke to the world's big polluters." We are disappointed by inadequate action by developed countries and outraged by the dithering and retreat of one of the most culpable polluters from the Paris Agreement," she said." In the midst of a climate emergency, retreat and inaction are tantamount to sanctioning ecocide. They reflect profound failure to honour collective global commitment to protect the most vulnerable." With our very existence at stake, COP 25 must demonstrate unprecedented ambition to avert ecocide." The COP25 meeting will aim to step up ambition so that all countries increase their national commitments to cut emissions. The meeting follows on the heels of three UN reports which stressed the increased urgency of limiting dangerous climate change. According to UN Secretary General António Guterres, "the point of no return is no longer over the horizon". Speaking ahead of the meeting, he said political leaders had to respond to the imminent climate crisis." In the crucial 12 months ahead, it is essential that we secure more ambitious national commitments - particularly from the main emitters - to immediately start reducing greenhouse gas emissions at a pace consistent to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050." We simply have to stop digging and drilling and take advantage of the vast possibilities offered by renewable energy and nature-based solutions," Mr Guterres said. Almost every country in the world has now signed and ratified the Paris climate agreement and under the terms of the pact they will all have to put new climate pledges on the table before the end of 2020. This meeting in Madrid signals the start of a frantic 12 months of negotiations that will culminate in Glasgow with COP26 in November next year. Some 50 world leaders are expected to attend the meeting in the Spanish capital - but US President Donald Trump will not be among them. The US became a signatory to the landmark Paris climate agreement in April 2016, under the Obama administration. But President Trump has said the accord - which has been signed by more than 190 countries - would lead to lost jobs and lower wages for American workers. Last month, he began the process of withdrawing from the Paris deal. However, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, will attend the conference with a congressional delegation. While her presence has been welcomed, US environmentalists want to see concrete steps on climate." While it's great Speaker Pelosi is coming to Madrid in place of Trump, symbolic gestures are no substitute for bold action," said Jean Su from the US Center for Biological Diversity." America remains the number one historic contributor to the climate emergency, and even Democratic politicians have never committed to taking responsibility for our fair share." Underlining the real world impacts of climate change, a report from the charity Save the Children, says that what it calls "climate shocks" are threatening tens of millions of people in East and Southern Africa. The charity says 33 million people are at emergency levels of food insecurity due to cyclones and droughts. More than half of these are believed to be children. The situation has been made worse because the two strongest cyclones ever to hit the African continent, affected the same region just weeks apart. Cyclone Idai struck Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi last March, while six weeks later Cyclone Kenneth slammed Mozambique with millions affected by flooding." The climate crisis is happening here, and it's killing people, forcing them from their homes and ruining children's chance of a future," said Ian Vale from Save the Children.	False

The Trump Administration Will Not Be Happy About the Forest Service's New Fire Management Strategy As wildfires continue to rage across the West during a brutally hot summer, on Thursday the US Forest Service released its new forest fire management strategy that focuses on science and the changing climate. The report comes at the same time the president has sent out misleading tweets about the causes and solutions of California's wildfires, and as Donald Trump's Interior head Ryan Zinke has blamed fires on environmentalists, denied climate change science, and called for more logging. Zinke has said the forest fires have "nothing to do with climate change" and recently called the left "angry," "intolerant" and "uninformed" on the environment and public land management, according to the Huffington Post. But the Department of the Interior disputes this in an email to Mother Jones, saying, "The Secretary addressed the correlation between climate and fires dozens of times over the 48 hours he was in California and all week in interviews since returning. Additionally, in his op-ed, the Secretary directly addressed longer, hotter, drier seasons in the opening paragraphs." It's true that Zinke changed his tune—after his earlier comments, Zinke told reporters Thursday that climate change has played a role in the fires and that global temperatures are rising. Trump weighed in on California's fires on Twitter earlier this month, with tweets that were immediately described as false and misleading, saying, "California wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren't allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized…Must also tree clear to stop fire spreading!"Mother Jones asked an expert to decipher this nonsense, and you can read his analysis here. But today, the Forest Service, which is part of the Department of Agriculture, released a new 28-page fire-management strategy. In it, the service writes, "Of particular concern are longer fire seasons and the rising size and severity of wildfires, along with the growing risk to lives, homes, natural resources, and other values." The report also includes a map of changes in fire weather seasons in the United States between 1979 and 2017, a phenomenon scientists warn is largely due to climate change:Though the Forest Service doesn't mention the words "climate change" specifically (as past versions of the plan have), it points out that "changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and other environmental conditions" are all "driving factors" behind wildfires and other environmental challenges. And in the Appendix, the Forest Service writes, "effects of a changing climate" are a general threat to forest health." t's a breath of fresh air to see science, instead of politics, inserted into forest and fire management," said Kirin Kennedy, associate legislative director for lands and wildlife at the Sierra Club, in a statement.

Environmental groups to sue Trump administration over offshore drilling tests Environmental groups plan to sue the Trump administration over offshore drilling tests, launching a legal fight against a proposal that has drawn bipartisan opposition along the Atlantic Coast, two people with direct knowledge of the pending litigation told The Associated Press. The lawsuit, which aims to stop the issuance of permits for the use of seismic air guns, will be filed by a coalition of environmental groups in federal court in South Carolina on Tuesday, according to the individuals. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly before the suit is filed. The Trump administration has authorized five such permits, which aim to find oil and gas formations deeply below the Atlantic Ocean floor, from Delaware to central Florida, an area where seismic surveys haven't been conducted in decades. The blasts are conducted in preparation for potential offshore drilling, which the administration has proposed to expand from the Atlantic to the Arctic and Pacific oceans. The five-year plan would open 90 percent of the nation's offshore reserves to private development. Survey vessels will be required to have observers on board to listen and watch for marine life and alert operators if a protected species comes within a certain distance, officials have said, and acoustic monitoring will be used to detect those animals swimming beneath the ocean surface. Surveys would be shut down when certain sensitive species or groups are observed and penalties could be imposed for vessels that strike marine animals. The precautions aren't enough for environmental groups, who have said the blasts can disturb marine mammals. Industry groups say the surveys have been conducted around the world for decades, with little adverse impact. The drilling issue has created strange political bedfellows along the East Coast, with Democrats and Republicans in some areas united over the issue. In South Carolina's 1st Congressional District, Republican Katie Arrington — a supporter of President Donald Trump who initially said she stood by his plans to open up Atlantic Coast drilling — later backed off that support amid a growing wave of drilling opposition in the coastal district she aimed to represent. Arrington ultimately lost the general election to Joe Cunningham, a Democrat staunchly opposed to drilling who collected support from coastal Republican mayors. Voters said they had been turned off by what they saw as Arrington's flip-flop on the issue, and they turned instead to Cunningham's consistency. On Monday, Cunningham told the AP that he backed the legal effort, which would pair with legislative action he plans to take up in the U.S. House."I'm going to go up to D.C. and fight like hell," Cunningham said. "These lawsuits are one tool in our bag that we're going to use." South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster's early support of Trump's candidacy hasn't stopped him from opposing the president's drilling plans. Earlier this year, McMaster was among state executives to request a drilling waiver, seeking the same sort of promise already given to Florida Gov. Rick Scott, another Trump ally. Since then, officials from the Department of the Interior have said Secretary Ryan Zinke's promise to Florida was not a formal action and will instead be part of the department's analysis as it completes its plans. In February, McMaster met with Zinke at the Governor's Mansion in Columbia. This week, McMaster spokesman Brian Symmes told The Associated Press that the governor and the state's top prosecutor, both Republicans, would continue to work on a plan to keep drilling away from the state." The governor and Attorney General (Alan) Wilson have resolved to continue working together to determine the best path forward," Symmes said. "Anything and everything is on the table to keep us from seeing seismic testing or offshore drilling off the coast of South Carolina." State Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican representing parts of the greater Charleston area, supports the lawsuit, which she called South Carolina's best option to challenge federal government overreach." The government doesn't get to pick winners and losers in this thing," Mace said. "When you have every mayor, every community saying, 'We don't want this,' and now you're going to shove seismic testing down our throats? I don't think so." Mace said she is concerned both with potential environmental damage and the possible threat to South Carolina's $20 billion tourism industry, much of which centers around the coast." We have the potential to destroy that beauty off our coast with rigs that nobody wants," Mace said. "We've got to do something, and a lawsuit might be the only way to do it."	False

EPA terminates Obama's climate plan... HAZARD, Ky. (AP) — A coalition of left-leaning states and environmental groups are vowing to fight the Trump administration's move to kill an Obama-era effort to limit carbon emissions from coal-fired power plants. Speaking Monday in the coal-mining state of Kentucky, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt said he would be issuing a new set of rules overriding the Clean Power Plan, the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's drive to curb global climate change." The war on coal is over," Pruitt declared, adding that no federal agency should ever use its authority to "declare war on any sector of our economy." It was not immediately clear if Pruitt would seek to issue a new rule without congressional approval, which Republicans had criticized the Obama administration for doing. Pruitt's rule wouldn't become final for months, and is then highly likely to face a raft of legal challenges. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was among those who said they will sue." The Trump Administration's persistent and indefensible denial of climate change — and their continued assault on actions essential to stemming its increasing devastation — is reprehensible, and I will use every available legal tool to fight their dangerous agenda," said Schneiderman, a Democrat. For Pruitt, getting rid of the Clean Power Plan will mark the culmination of a long fight he began as the elected attorney general of Oklahoma. Pruitt was among about two dozen attorney generals who sued to stop Obama's 2014 push to limit carbon emissions, stymieing the limits from ever taking effect. Closely aligned with the oil and gas industry in his home state, Pruitt rejects the consensus of scientists that man-made emissions from burning fossil fuels are the primary driver of global climate change. President Donald Trump, who appointed Pruitt and shares his skepticism of established climate science, promised to kill the Clean Power Plan during the 2016 campaign as part of his broader pledge to revive the nation's struggling coal mines. In his order Tuesday, Pruitt is expected to declare that the Obama-era rule exceeded federal law by setting emissions standards that power plants could not reasonably meet. Pruitt appeared at an event with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at Whayne Supply in Hazard, Kentucky, a company that sells coal mining supplies. The store's owners have been forced to lay off about 60 percent of its workers in recent years. While cheering the demise of the Clean Power Plan as a way to stop the bleeding, McConnell conceded most of those lost jobs are never coming back."A lot of damage has been done," said McConnell, a Kentucky Republican. "This doesn't immediately bring everything back, but we think it stops further decline of coal fired plants in the United States and that means there will still be some market here." Obama's plan was designed to cut U.S. carbon dioxide emissions to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The rule dictated specific emission targets for states based on power-plant emissions and gave officials broad latitude to decide how to achieve reductions. The Supreme Court put the plan on hold last year following legal challenges by industry and coal-friendly states. Even so, the plan helped drive a recent wave of retirements of coal-fired plants, which are also being squeezed by low cost natural gas and renewable power. In the absence of stricter federal regulations curbing greenhouse gas emissions, many states have issued their own mandates promoting energy conservation. The withdrawal of the Clean Power Plan is the latest in a series of moves by Trump and Pruitt to dismantle Obama's legacy on fighting climate change, including the delay or roll back of rules limiting levels of toxic pollution in smokestack emissions and wastewater discharges from coal-burning power plants. On Thursday, Trump nominated former coal-industry lobbyist Andrew Wheeler to serve as Pruitt's top deputy at EPA — one of several recent political appointees at the agency with direct ties to the fossil fuel interests. The president announced earlier this year that he will pull the United States out of the landmark Paris climate agreement. Nearly 200 countries have committed to combat global warming by reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming." This president has tremendous courage," Pruitt said Monday. "He put America first and said to the rest of the world we are going to say no and exit the Paris Accord. That was the right thing to do." Despite the rhetoric about saving coal, government statistics show that coal mines currently employ only about 52,000 workers nationally — a modest 4-percent uptick since Trump became president. Those numbers are dwarfed by the jobs created by building such clean power infrastructure as wind turbines and solar arrays." Trump is not just ignoring the deadly cost of pollution, he's ignoring the clean energy deployment that is rapidly creating jobs across the country," said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. Associated Press writer Michael Biesecker reported from Washington. Follow him at  story has been corrected to show the percentage of coal jobs created under Trump was 4 percent.	False
388	drudgereport	right_bias	2018-12-08	Thus, one well-worn tactic employed by those who would presume to tell the rest of us how to live, where to live, and how to work—all of the good of the planet, of course—is the alarmist study, making copious use of lies of omission and commission.

And it's these three things: wealth, growth and technology, which allows humans to thrive on planet Earth, not $240 per gallon fuel taxes imposed by an elite that cares not for the masses.	So how do climate activists get their way?	This makes for scary headlines in the New York Times or CNN, but it is far from sound science or even good economics.		Is America Next? The City of Lights, Paris, has been illuminated in recent days by cars set alight by thousands of protesting "Yellow Vests"—largely middle class people who earn their living by driving or who commute to get to work. The cause of their ire is a scheduled 25 cents-per-gallon increase in gas taxes, and about 10 cents on diesel, to fight climate change. French President Macron, deeply unpopular, just reversed course on the new green tax—Parisians are already paying about $7.06 per gallon for gasoline, almost half of that in taxes. If Paris streets burned over a proposed 25 cents per gallon climate change tax, imagine the global conflagration over a $49 per gallon tax. That's what a United Nations special climate report calls for in 12 years, with a carbon tax of $5,500 per ton—equal to $49 per gallon of gasoline or diesel. That's about 100 times today's average state and federal motor fuels tax. By 2100, the U.N. estimates that a carbon tax of $27,000 per ton is needed—$240 per gallon—to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Of course, that isn't going to happen. The economic wreckage of such a punitive tax would plunge the global economy into a permanent depression—and that's assuming politicians could enact such huge tax increases over the will of their voters. Keep in mind that the unrest in France was triggered by a looming 25-cent hike, which is a little less than 10% more in taxes than French drivers already pay. To meet the $49 per gallon tax hike recommended by the U.N., fuel taxes in France would have to go up 17-fold. The violent protests in France were fueled by intense frustration felt by a middle class that sees itself squeezed. They don't earn enough to be part of the elite unconcerned with fuel taxes, but they work hard enough that they don't qualify for the generous welfare benefits handed out to the nation's poor and to newly arrived immigrants from Africa and the Middle East. Here in America, Republicans in Congress passed a resolution against carbon taxes over the summer while Democrats embraced the concept in their party platform. Some incoming members of the new Democratic majority in the House are calling to create a select committee to map out a "Green New Deal" that would move the U.S. toward using 100% renewable energy for the electric grid while guaranteeing jobs for everyone. In the meantime, opinion polls indicate that 54% of Americans do not believe global warming will cause major problems within their lifetimes. So how do climate activists get their way? Some openly talk of imposing authoritarian governance to override democratic institutions. Former NASA climate researcher James Hansen suggested in 2007 that "the democratic process does not work." Other scientists have called the threat of global warming the equivalent of war while calling for the crushing of dissent and the jailing of "deniers." Those who see climate change as a dire and urgent threat have some work to do to convince voters in the Western democracies to give up their way of life in exchange for unspecified benefits of a slightly less warm world—and that's assuming China, India and over a billion people in Africa can be convinced not to try to pull themselves out of poverty—something that may only be done with greater use of fossil fuels. Thus, one well-worn tactic employed by those who would presume to tell the rest of us how to live, where to live, and how to work—all of the good of the planet, of course—is the alarmist study, making copious use of lies of omission and commission. An example of the former can be seen in the new National Climate Assessment. The report's first chapter lists recent natural disasters, citing this summer's deadly Carr Fire in California as an example. But while the report seeks to link wildfire to climate change, it glosses over the real reason fires have grown in intensity and size: the 30 years of increased environmental restrictions on logging, brush clearance and preventive burns that caused a massive and dangerous fuel buildup—a problem that was predicted years ago and has nothing to do with global warming. The sin of commission in the service of scaring middle class voters into doing that they're supposed to can be seen in an economic modeling study paid for by our federal tax dollars as well as underwritten by two billionaires who would be president: Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg. Here we're told that the U.S. economy will take a 10% hit by 2100 unless we reduce our carbon emissions. Two problems, though: the authors assume the worst-case and least likely scenario, with average temperatures more than 14 degrees Fahrenheit hotter by 2100; and they derive two-thirds of their economic losses estimate by claiming a large amount of premature deaths due to the hotter temperatures. The latter claim is highly problematic as death rates in regions far hotter than in the U.S. aren't meaningfully different, when accounting for the standard of living. Why? People adapt rather easily. This makes for scary headlines in the New York Times or CNN, but it is far from sound science or even good economics. The bottom line is this: economic freedom—the kind you get with a large middle class—leads to prosperity, economic growth, and technological innovation. And it's these three things: wealth, growth and technology, which allows humans to thrive on planet Earth, not $240 per gallon fuel taxes imposed by an elite that cares not for the masses.	True

Humans sleepwalking into mass extinction of species not seen since dinosaurs... Humans are sleepwalking into a mass extinction of species not seen since the demise of the dinosaurs, British scientists warned. Man-made global change is threatening the diversity of different creatures that have taken millennia to evolve to live in niche habitats. Creatures that have moved into delicate ecosystems such as coral reefs often live in symbiosis with others and are the slowest to recover their diversity if damaged. But global warming and rising sea levels threatened to wipe out many species that cannot adapt to change quickly enough "in a blink of an eye." In particular freshwater habitats are teeming with diverse birds and mammals but they are often form isolated pockets which are vulnerable to sudden change. Professor of Evolutionary Paleobiology Matthew Wills at the Milner Centre for Evolution at the University of Bath said:We are sleepwalking into a mass extinction of a magnitude unparalleled since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. Astonishingly, we know remarkably little about the physical and biological forces that shape patterns of diversity on a global scale. For example, why are there over a million species of insects but only 32 species in their immediate sister group, the little known remipedes? Diversity takes millions of years to evolve, but can be damaged in the blink of an eye. We are already losing diversity that has never even been documented, so it's vitally important to understand the mechanisms that drive evolution into new species. The scientists looked at how the humble caridean shrimp has evolved and diversified since it first appeared in the Lower Jurassic. There are now around 3,500 species worldwide living in salt and fresh water habitats and are a vital component of the marine food chain, and an important contribution to fisheries worldwide. Research Fellow Dr Katie Davis, an evolutionary palaeobiologist at the University of York explained:Understanding the processes that shaped the strikingly irregular distribution of species richness across the Tree of Life is a major research agenda. Changes in ecology may go some way to explain the often strongly asymmetrical fates of sister clades, and we test this in the caridean shrimps. There are, depending upon estimates, between two and 50 million extant species of animals (Metazoa), all derived from a single common ancestral species that lived some 650 million years ago. Net rates of speciation therefore exceed rates of extinction, but the balance of these processes varies greatly, both between clades and throughout geological time. The scientists examined the patterns of diversity change across the crustaceans's evolutionary tree. By time-calibrating the largest ever evolutionary tree for carideans against both fossil and molecular dates, it was possible to explore where rates of diversification sped up and slowed down over the last 200 million years. They found the shrimp have independently transitioned from marine to freshwater habitats repeatedly, creating much richer pockets of biodiversity. The relative isolation of lakes and rivers appear to increase the diversity of species in a similar way to Darwin's finches on island chains. But rising sea levels caused by climate change could put these pockets at risk, disrupting these freshwater distributions and leading to extinctions as a result. By contrast, many marine shrimp live in close symbiotic associations with a variety of other animals including corals and sponges, which appears to have slowed their diversification rate. Symbioses are most common in shallow reef settings: among the most diverse but notoriously delicately balanced and threatened marine ecosystems. The researchers said lower rates of diversification mean it will take longer for carideans to recover from the extinctions that are already inevitably underway. Co-author Sammy de Grave, head of research at the Oxford University Museum added:The study was published in the journal Communications Biology.	False

Palm Beach County Commissioner Steven Abrams downplayed the political aspects of the Senate committee hearing in a statement Friday.	pic.	"What won't solve the problem is putting our heads in the Florida sand while streets and basements flood around us," she said in a statement.		Trump denies climate change, but could one day be its victim Not that surprising, except this was a Senate committee field hearing challenging the position shared by President Donald Trump and many Republicans in Congress that climate change isn't real. The site of the hearing -- just four miles from Trump's weekend getaway in Palm Beach -- was clearly intended to send a signal: Much of Florida's coastline could one day be underwater, including some of the President's own prized properties." Today we sit at ground zero of the impacts of climate change in the US," Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson said. "And while there are still some who continue to deny climate change is real, South Florida offers proof that it is real and it's an issue we're going to be grappling with for decades to come." Data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show that Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club and his condominiums in Hollywood, Florida, would be partially submerged if sea level rose three feet by the end of the century. Already, Hollywood experiences more incidents of tidal flooding. NOAA itself, in a recent report, raised the specter of millions of coastal residents in the United States -- especially along the low-lying East Coast -- being displaced by coastal flooding. The agency outlined how sea levels could rise by at least four to five feet by century's end, engulfing numerous coastal communities or making flooding so frequent as to render them uninhabitable. "What we thought was extremely rare, large floods invading coastal cities on a regular basis, is becoming more and more probable," said William Sweet, an oceanographer at NOAA and the report's lead author. "The gap between our infrastructure and the global sea level is narrowing," A recent study published in Nature concluded that with the acceleration of ice melt in Antarctica, sea levels could rise to six feet by 2100. At that point, Trump's golf course at Doral, Florida, and several properties at Sunny Isles Beach would also be under water. The fact that Trump's own properties are vulnerable to the impact of climate change is paradoxical, given that the EPA is poised to undo President Barack Obama's plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. In a now infamous 2012 tweet, Trump claimed that "global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive." The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 6, 2012 The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee hearing was conducted by Nelson, the panel's ranking member, but it was authorized by Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the committee's chairman, who has acknowledged human activity is responsible for climate change. Climate change is not just a threat to our planet's future - it's a threat to our communities today. Thanks @SenBillNelson for this hearing. pic. twitter. com/ixO6VhRhrO — Rep. Ted Deutch (@RepTedDeutch) April 10, 2017 Thune told Fox News anchor Chris Wallace in a 2014 interview, for example, "Well, look, climate change is occurring, it's always occurring, Chris. There are a number of factors that contribute to that, including human activity. The question is, what are we going to do about it and at what cost?" Trump has proposed slashing the EPA budget by a third and eliminating many climate-change programs entirely. But, when it comes to his own property in Ireland, a golf course and resort in the small town of Doonbeg, the President took a more proactive approach. He proposed to build a wall to fight coastal erosion by the course's sand dunes, which eroded after heavy storms in 2014. After several attempts to gain approval, the President refiled an application in December 2016 and is still waiting to get an authorization from the local county council. For many coastal communities, the problems have already begun. Flooding and high winds are more frequent, said Sweet, the NOAA oceanographer. Hurricane Sandy broke through the sea walls of several homes near Mar-a-Lago in 2012, and Palm Beach County had to restore more than 20 acres of eroded seashore. Miami, meanwhile, is investing millions of dollars to raise the level of its properties, its roads and water systems as protection against flooding. Other cities like Norfolk, Virginia, and Charleston, South Carolina that are at risk of extreme flooding, are also trying to deal with the issue. Christina DeConcini, director of government affairs for the environmental group World Resources Institute, said the US needs a "fact-based approach for how to address this clear and present danger to America's infrastructure, homes and businesses. "What won't solve the problem is putting our heads in the Florida sand while streets and basements flood around us," she said in a statement. Palm Beach County Commissioner Steven Abrams downplayed the political aspects of the Senate committee hearing in a statement Friday. "Sea level rise and coastal flooding driven by climate change pose real, significant risks to our residents and should not be politicized,'' he said.	False

California districts sue US govt for $1.4bn over water contamination from military base Two water districts in Sacramento, California are suing the US government for nearly one and a half billion dollars for groundwater cleanup. Plaintiffs claim heavy metals used by aircraft maintenance crews at the old McClellan Air Force Base have contaminated over 300 sites.

Plaintiffs argue that the chemicals have been found in groundwater under the base as high as 840 parts per billion, six times higher than levels that decrease away from the air base. The state set a maximum concentration for chromium 6 as 10 parts per billion in 2014. The Air Force denied Rio Linda Elverta's claim in a May 9 letter before the district sued in federal court on June 30. The Air Force had consistently denied responsibility for polluting the groundwater around the base, which operated from 1936 through 2001, before being converted to a business park. In addition to the Air Force, the water district lawsuits name 10 firms they say were associated with providing chemicals to the base: Elementis Chromium Inc., Occidental Chemical Corp., Honeywell Inc., BASF Corp., PPG Inc., E.I. Du Pont De Nemours and Co., Luxfer Holdings PLC, Sigma-Aldrich Corp. and Dow Chemical Co. Officials with Sacramento Suburban, which serves 175,000 customers just east of the old base, and Rio Linda Elverta, which serves about 15,000 customers to the west of the base, say the water they are currently providing is safe.A 2016 Harvard study of some 36,000 EPA water samples taken from 2013 to 2015 at industrial sites, military fire training locations, airports and wastewater treatments plants contained levels of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), or perfluorinated chemicals, that go beyond what is considered safe by the federal government. Researchers determined that drinking water for 6 million in the US is at or beyond the EPA safety threshold for PFAS levels. Xindi Hu, the study's lead author, warned that "the actual number of people exposed may be even higher than our study found, because government data for levels of these compounds in drinking water is lacking for almost a third of the U.S. population—about 100 million people."

Defying Trump, Senate panel approves funding for U.N. climate body WASHINGTON (Reuters) – The U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee passed a spending bill on Thursday evening that includes $10 million to help fund the United Nations' climate change body that oversees the Paris Climate Agreement, despite President Donald Trump's decision to stop funding it. The 30-member Senate panel, which allocates federal funds to various government agencies and organizations, approved a $51 billion spending bill for the State Department and foreign operations, which included an amendment to continue funding the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change as well as the scientific body the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The amendment passed even though the 2018 budget proposal that Trump, a Republican, introduced earlier this year eliminated support of any mechanism to finance climate change projects in developing countries and organizations. The United States is still a party to the 1992 UNFCCC, which oversees the Paris agreement, although Trump announced in June that he would withdraw the nation from the global climate pact and cease funding the Green Climate Fund, which supports clean energy and climate adaptation projects in vulnerable countries. The United States has usually contributed to around 20 percent of the UNFCCC budget. Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, the amendment's author, said on Twitter on Thursday: "Despite @RealDonaldTrump's dangerous #ParisAgreement decision & unwillingness to act, we can & will fight back to combat #climatedisruption." The amendment passed 16-14. Republican Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee voted in favor, as did all committee Democrats except for West Virginia's Joe Manchin. Although the United States announced it would no longer be a party to the Paris Climate Agreement, a pact that nearly 200 countries approved in 2015 to combat global warming, it has said it will continue to observe the ongoing negotiations. In a diplomatic cable that Reuters obtained last month, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said U.S. diplomats should sidestep questions from foreign governments on how the United States plans re-engage in the global Paris climate agreement. The cable also said diplomats should make clear that the United States wants to help other countries use fossil fuels, which have been linked to global warming. [L1N1KU0UP]	False

"It's time for the people to step up to resolve this crisis before we run out of time."		2 protesters arrested after laying down on tracks to block oil train in Washington Protesters were arrested in Washington after blocking an oil train by erecting a "pop-up garden of sunflowers" and lying down on the train tracks. The group was protesting a proposed oil terminal and all other fossil fuel infrastructure in the state. Two people were arrested Monday during a protest in downtown Vancouver, Washington held by the activist group Shut Down Fossil Fuels. Protesters locked their arms into large sunflower pots and laid down on train tracks, calling on Washington Governor Jay Inslee (D) to reject the proposed Vancouver Tesoro Savage Oil Terminal and "all other proposed fossil fuel infrastructure in the State of Washington," the group said in a press release. The protesters were blocking a BNSF train carrying Bakken Crude Oil, a highly volatile oil that caused a train to explode in Mosier, Oregon last June. Jessie Braverman, the group's media liaison, told RT that around 25 people showed up at the train tracks to address climate change, and let the governor know that "if he isn't going to stop the terminal than we will." Our community and our planet are under attack, yet the political response has been amoral and inadequate. We were here on the tracks a year after the Mosier oil train derailment and nothing has changed," Braverman said in a statement. "The trains are still coming and new fossil fuel projects are still being proposed; we're in the midst of a worldwide climate emergency and we're fighting back." Braverman confirmed that two people were arrested during the protest and they are still being held in jail. She also said that there had been "no word" from the governor, whom they had been attempting to contact throughout the day. According to the Associated Press, the tracks were cleared after an hour. In 2014, the state of Washington passed legislation to increase track and hazardous material inspections, require oil spill contingency plans, increase funding for prevention and cleanup of oil spills, and improve safety at crossings along oil train routes. However, Inslee said that "states are limited in what we can do" in creating regulations for interstate railroads." ailroads engage in interstate commerce, which means the buck stops with the federal government. While federal regulators acknowledge the risks of crude-by-rail, they have taken few steps toward increasing safety," Inslee wrote in an op-ed for the Columbian last year. "The combination of federal preemption and federal inaction is unacceptable." Inslee urged Congress and the US Department of Transportation to implement even tougher regulations, including lower speed limits for high-hazard flammable trains and to use safer cars that are "strong enough to protect volatile contents from the heat of a fire or the impact of a collision." However, the group said that Inslee has failed to craft an emissions reduction strategy and the state "continues to move towards a dizzying array of new fossil fuel developments." If I can stop an oil train, Governor Jay Inslee can stop an oil terminal," Chris, one of the protesters, said in a statement. Ultimately, Shut Down Fossil Fuels is calling for "an end to oil trains, oil terminals, and all fossil fuels." It's now or never. We're up against the wire and nobody — no politician, no agency, no industry — is stepping up to resolve the climate crisis," Mike, one of the protesters locked to a flower pot, said in a statement.

The damages from the hurricanes, heat waves, wildfires, and tornadoes in 2017 cost at least $306 billion."	"Climate change" isn't part of it.		FEMA is preparing for the future. "Climate change" isn't part of it. The United States is still reeling from last year's megadisasters. Puerto Rico lingers in the longest blackout in US history after Hurricane Maria tore through the island, and the scorched earth left behind from record-breaking fires in California is now causing floods and mudslides. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which was on the front lines of many of these calamities, had to go back to Congress last September to ask for billions more dollars to handle the gargantuan relief efforts. With some of the dust settled, it's clear that the events in 2017 fit the pattern of extreme weather we expect as average global temperatures go up, with strong climate change signals emerging in fires and rainfall. FEMA has, and will continue to, respond to climate change-influenced disasters. But the agency's new strategic plan for 2018-2022, released Thursday, doesn't mention climate change or global warming at all. That's despite the fact that the 38-page document projects more frequent and more expensive disasters. This is a glaring omission from an agency that deals with anticipating and responding to weather extremes driven in part by a changing climate. The damages from the hurricanes, heat waves, wildfires, and tornadoes in 2017 cost at least $306 billion." isaster costs are expected to continue to increase due to rising natural hazard risk, decaying critical infrastructure, and economic pressures that limit investments in risk resilience," according to the document. FEMA did signal that it wants to invest more in "pre-disaster mitigation," which may or may not include climate change. But it wasn't so coy in its previous 2014-2018 strategic plan, which noted that the agency "will also ensure that future risks, including those influenced by climate change, are effectively integrated into the Agency's risk assessment resources and processes." Dropping climate change from FEMA's strategic plan is just the latest part of the Trump administration's long pattern of erasing climate change as a public policy issue across the federal government. Agencies including the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of the Interior have removed climate change language from many of their websites. Other agencies have limited access to policy and technical documents dealing with climate change. And some government research grant applications faced extra scrutiny and rejection for mentioning the "double C-word." It's not just rhetoric. President Trump wants the United States to back out of the Paris climate agreement, and the EPA is working to undo the main policy for restricting greenhouse gases, the Clean Power Plan. The White House's latest budget proposal seeks a 72 percent cut to clean energy research and reduces FEMA's budget by almost $600 million from $16.1 billion. The recent personnel shake-up across the federal government doesn't bode well for the fight against climate change either. Rex Tillerson, who was fired as secretary of state this week, wanted the United States to remain in the Paris deal. His likely replacement, Mike Pompeo, doesn't believe humanity is warming the planet. And former White House adviser George David Banks, who suggested that Trump could rejoin the Paris agreement, resigned last month after he failed to get a security clearance due to past marijuana use. The net result is that the Trump administration is doing little to either mitigate or adapt to rising temperatures. And now homeowners, many of whom received disaster relief money from FEMA, are rebuilding in floodplains and high-fire-risk areas. It seems FEMA doesn't want to build on this history of climate disasters. Now it looks like we're condemned to repeat it.	False

U.S. is reducing dependence on fossil fuels even without Paris climate agreement WASHINGTON – President Trump's decision to back out of the Paris climate accord is a blow to environmental activists, but the nation's steady, years-long reduction in greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming won't suddenly stop. Utility companies have announced plans to fully or partially close more than a half dozen coal-fired power plants since Trump took office fewer than five months ago, taking some of the nation's largest greenhouse gas emitters off-line. And Wall Street fund managers and large businesses are moving away from fossil fuels due to market conditions, further contributing to increased use of cleaner energy sources. Since 2010, more than 250 coal-fired power plants have closed in the U.S. On Wednesday, Exxon Mobil shareholders voted – against the board's recommendation – to require the company publicly report on the risks to its business posed by climate change." he United States is making progress," said John Coequyt, Global Climate Policy Director for the Sierra Club. "We're moving forward. We believe the rest of the world will do the same." Trump has already taken unilateral steps to roll back regulations that were designed to implement the Paris agreement, including reversing President Obama's Clean Power Plan rule that sought to lower greenhouse emissions. Trump campaigned on a promise to withdraw the U.S. from the accord, saying it would lead to higher energy prices and hurt domestic businesses from being able to compete globally." As president, I have one obligation and that obligation is to the American people," Trump said during a speech in the Rose Garden announcing the decision. "The Paris Accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risk, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other counties of the world." The international agreement, which was signed in 2015 and went into effect seven months ago, is considered a major part the environmental legacy of the Obama administration. Michael A. Needham, chief executive officer of the conservative Heritage Action for America, applauded the president's move." Withdrawal from the agreement marks a critical step in unraveling former President Obama's destructive legacy," Needham said. "Not only did Obama make this agreement without approval from Congress, but in doing so he handed more control of America's energy to foreign officials." Experts say pulling out of the accord will slow but hardly stop the momentum that's been building to keep a global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Under current policy, the U.S. is still set to come "within striking distance" of meeting its 2020 goal under a prior U.N. climate change accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 17% below 2005 levels, according to a report by energy analysts the Rhodium Group. But the analysis said withdrawing from the accord makes it very unlikely the U.S. will meet the 26-28% target set out under the Paris deal. The exit from the accord will allow states, such as California and New York, to play a leading role in meeting climate change targets. California, for example, has stood out with its toughest-in-the-nation vehicle emissions laws that often effectively establish auto industry standards nationwide. California Gov. Jerry Brown said he hopes Trump's "insane move" to back out of the Paris accord will spur others to action." California will resist," he told reporters on a conference call after Trump's announcement. "California (is) all in. We're on the field ready for battle and while our president may be AWOL in the battle against climate change, we're not."	False

EPA nominee Andrew Wheeler's confirmation hearing was all about climate change Senate Democrats used the Wednesday confirmation hearing of Andrew Wheeler, the acting administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to push him on the agency's negligence on climate change, its rollback of regulations designed to protect Americans' health, and his uncannily close ties to the fossil fuel industry." o you agree with the scientific community that climate change is a global crisis?" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) asked Wheeler repeatedly."  would not call it the greatest crisis, no, sir," Wheeler responded. "I consider it to be an issue that has to be addressed globally." Substantively, I think you have your thumb, wrist, forearm, and elbow on the scale," Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) told Wheeler, referring to Wheeler's past work as a coal lobbyist. Some Republicans raised concerns about climate change as well. At a few points, the hearing was interrupted by protesters and chants of "shut down Wheeler, not the EPA." Eight protesters were arrested. Wheeler, for his part, emphasized in the hearing before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee that the EPA was revising Obama-era environmental regulations like the Clean Power Plan and the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards to comply with court rulings. It was a signal that he plans to continue to methodically advance Trump's agenda, but in a much less bombastic way than former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who resigned last year in disgrace after numerous allegations of ethics violations. Some Democrats even praised Wheeler for his collegiality and for being much more accessible than Pruitt. However, others said he was tilting regulations in favor of the sectors the EPA is supposed to regulate, for instance, weakening pollution regulations on coal-fired power plants. Before his work as a coal lobbyist, Wheeler was a staffer at the EPA and on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. He was also an Eagle Scout and emphasized his love of hiking and camping. "I do consider myself a conservationist," he said. Unlike Pruitt, Wheeler did acknowledge that humans are driving changes in the climate and that it must be addressed. When Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) asked Wheeler how he rated climate change in importance on a scale of 1 to 10, Wheeler said it was "8 or 9." Yet global emissions continue to rise, and scientists recently warned that we're running out of time to accelerate the global effort to limit warming to a less disastrous level. Instead of joining this effort, the EPA is working to relax rules on emissions. And given that Wheeler answers to President Trump, who has dismissed climate change as a concern, it's unlikely we'll see any radical changes at the EPA anytime soon. The Senate is expected to confirm Wheeler soon as the new head of the agency in a vote. Several Republicans brought up climate change during the hearing, noting their concerns about the rise of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States in 2018, which Wheeler had disputed." e heard that there was an emissions rise in 2018, which you attributed to a cold winter, a hot summer, and also to more economic activity," said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV). "You said you expect that to go down over time. What gives you the confidence that if this economy continues to roll the way we think it will, that will actually happen?"Wheeler said that greater energy efficiency in the power sector along with fuel economy standards would continue to drive down emissions. Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) suggested that technology is the main solution to greenhouse gases and asked Wheeler about the EPA's role in fostering innovation and using tactics like capturing carbon dioxide to extract more oil or make building materials. Wheeler said that all of EPA's programs encourage innovation. "One thing that's important on the regulatory side is that we don't try to tip the scale one way or the other, for example, on energy sources," he said. That Republicans are acknowledging climate change at all is a sign that the political winds on the issue have shifted and they can no longer afford to be passive on the issue if they want policies on their terms. And innovation seems to be the key thread uniting Republican responses to climate change. As my colleague David Roberts pointed out, coming up with new technologies is indeed a key aspect of fighting climate change, but for Republicans, it may be a way to head off more ambitious climate policies. Already, momentum is building in the House for taxing carbon as well as a Green New Deal to fight climate change. During the hearing, Democrats revealed some of their strategy to pressure the EPA on climate change going forward. Since they lost seats in the Senate, Democrats emphasized key state-level disputes, like the fight between California and the EPA over fuel economy standards. Vehicles are a huge source of greenhouse gas emissions, and California wants to retain its authority to set tighter emissions rules than the rest of the country. The Trump administration wants one standard for the country as well as a much more relaxed fuel economy target than the one proposed under President Obama. Lawmakers from both sides also lamented the ongoing partial government shutdown. Most of the EPA's 13,000 employees are furloughed, but some are still on the job to deal with responses to disasters like the fallout from California's wildfires last year. Some employees were also recalled to help the EPA meet court-ordered deadlines for producing environmental regulations." nder these circumstances, it's not possible for EPA to do its mission," said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD). "I want to underscore how tragic this shutdown is."	False

The Pope And Big Oil Agree: You Should Pay More For Energy Energy and investment executives who met with Pope Francis earlier in June stood mostly in agreement that a tax on carbon emissions is the best path forward to combating climate change. Pope Francis hosted a two-day summit at the Vatican on June 8 and 9, inviting key players in the oil and gas industry for a back-and-forth discussion on climate change. The leader of the Catholic Church encouraged executives to give up fossil fuels and embrace renewable energy technology. The meeting was just the latest in a series of public moves the pope has made against traditional forms of electricity production. Most who took part in the summit agreed that a fee on carbon emissions is pivotal in reforming the U.S. energy sector, according to an Axios report. Ernest Moniz, who served as an energy secretary under the Obama administration, took part in the summit and said "one of the areas of focus was carbon pricing to create market incentives for the transition to a low-carbon system." Key members who met with Pope Francis include: ExxonMobil Chief Executive Darren Woods, BP CEO Bob Dudley, Equinor CEO Eldar Saetre and numerous others. The idea of a carbon tax — a fee charged onto companies according to the amount of carbon emissions their plants emit into the atmosphere — has been recommended as a "market friendly" method to controlling CO2 pollution. While carbon tax proposals appeared popular at the Vatican, it has not garnered the same amount of support in Congress. Majority Whip Steve Scalise and West Virginia Rep. David McKinley introduced a House resolution in April that explicitly condemns a tax on carbon dioxide pollution. (RELATED: Pope Criticizes Oil Executives, Silent On Ireland Legalizing Abortion)In a public letter of support for Scalise's resolution, a group of conservative organizations claimed that a carbon tax would ultimately result in a loss of jobs and higher electricity bills: "For example, a 2014 Heritage Foundation report found that a $37 per ton carbon tax would lead to a loss of more than $2.5 trillion in aggregate gross domestic product by 2030. That is more than $21,000 in income loss per family," a portion of the letter read. "In addition, a carbon tax would cost over 500,000 jobs in manufacturing and more than 1 million jobs by 2030. According to a 2013 CBO report, a carbon tax is highly regressive." House members have yet to vote on the anti-carbon tax resolution. However, the lower chamber of Congress passed a similar version in June 2016, collecting six Democratic votes and zero Republicans opposition.

Enviro Lawyer's Comments At NYC's Climate Week Could Sink City's Climate Crusade One of the attorneys heading New York City's climate litigation made comments in September that could seriously harm the city's mission to sue oil companies for contributing to global warming. New York City's climate lawsuits are ultimately designed to target the industry's financial bottom line, Susan Amron, the chief of the environmental law division of the New York City Law Department, said at a Sept. 26 panel discussion during the Climate Week NYC." o, we're not saying you can't use fossil fuels, that's a different part of the city's efforts," Amron said during the panel, noting also that the lawsuit is designed to impress on companies the need to "internalize the costs" fossil fuels impose on cities. She appeared to contradict herself a few sentences later, telling the audience that the intent is really to eliminate the oil industry's license to operate. "And really what we're trying to do is affect the bottom line- the financial equation for the use of fossil fuels," she said." e just acted, and I want to urge every city, every county, every state to do the same – divest. Divest from the fossil fuel industry," De Blasio told the Vermont Democrat at the time. "Let's help bring the death knell to this industry that's done so much harm." The lawsuit was dismissed in July a handful of months after De Blasio made his comment. Judge John Keenan wrote in his opinion at the time that legislative branch was the appropriate arena to address global warming. NYC's lawsuit does appear to suggest the intent is not to destroy but rather to mitigate harm." he City does not seek to impose liability on Defendants for their direct emissions of greenhouse gases and does not seek to restrain Defendants from engaging in their business operations," the city wrote in its complaint. Amron's admission will likely create challenges for the city's appeal, which is slated to begin in front of the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals soon. Neither Amron nor New York City's Law Department have responded to The Daily Caller News Foundation's request for an explanation about the lawsuit is designed to hammer the oil industry or for mitigation purposes. Other climate lawsuits across the country are similarly on the ropes. Cities in California, Colorado and Rhode Island have also filed similar lawsuits against energy producers over the past year. They argue that Exxon and others should pony-up money for mitigation efforts designed to forestall the effects from climate change.A judge dismissed lawsuits in Oakland and San Francisco, arguing that the U.S. Congress is only the governmental body responsible for enacting policies needed to mitigate global warming. Manufacturers and conservative groups worry trial attorneys are behind the spat of climate litigation.

(RELATED: Trial Lawyers Handling Cities' Global Warming Lawsuits Stand To Make Billions)Hagens Berman stood to earn billions of dollars in contingency fees depending on the total winnings, from a favorable judgement against oil companies.

So what you're saying, Dr Rothman, is that you're allowing plus or minus 10,000 years' leeway for this mass extinction which won't definitely happen but which "may" happen.	If we get a repeat of the Great Dying, 275 million years ago, what this means basically is that we are all going to die.	"This is not saying that disaster occurs the next day," Rothman says.	Do you know what?		Delingpole: Mass Extinction Apocalypse Will Begin Around 2100 Claims MIT Professor According to Daniel Rothman, professor of geophysics in the MIT Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences and co-director of MIT's Lorenz Center, we are fast approaching "thresholds of catastrophe" in the carbon cycle which make doom almost inevitable. In a paper published today in Science Advances, he proposes that mass extinction occurs if one of two thresholds are crossed: For changes in the carbon cycle that occur over long timescales, extinctions will follow if those changes occur at rates faster than global ecosystems can adapt. For carbon perturbations that take place over shorter timescales, the pace of carbon-cycle changes will not matter; instead, the size or magnitude of the change will determine the likelihood of an extinction event. Taking this reasoning forward in time, Rothman predicts that, given the recent rise in carbon dioxide emissions over a relatively short timescale, a sixth extinction will depend on whether a critical amount of carbon is added to the oceans. That amount, he calculates, is about 310 gigatons, which he estimates to be roughly equivalent to the amount of carbon that human activities will have added to the world's oceans by the year 2100. If we get a repeat of the Great Dying, 275 million years ago, what this means basically is that we are all going to die. Even you. But before you ring up your grandchildren and warn them to cancel the marquee they've booked for their 100th birthday celebrations, perhaps a note of caution should be attached to professor Rothman's cheery prediction. First, let's not forget it that it is flatly contradicted by the recent bombshell study suggesting that the effects of carbon dioxide on global warming have been overstated, that the computer models are running "too hot" and that we're not about to fry any time soon. Second, Rothman appears to have given himself so much margin for error as to render his doomsday projection meaningless. Does this mean that mass extinction will soon follow at the turn of the century? Rothman says it would take some time — about 10,000 years — for such ecological disasters to play out. However, he says that by 2100 the world may have tipped into "unknown territory." "This is not saying that disaster occurs the next day," Rothman says. "It's saying that, if left unchecked, the carbon cycle would move into a realm which would be no longer stable, and would behave in a way that would be difficult to predict. In the geologic past, this type of behavior is associated with mass extinction."R-i-g-h-t. So what you're saying, Dr Rothman, is that you're allowing plus or minus 10,000 years' leeway for this mass extinction which won't definitely happen but which "may" happen. Do you know what? Even though I'm not a professor of geophysics at MIT, I think even I could have come up with a scientific theory as rock-solid and testable as that one.	False

Friedman found a Republican to mouth concern over climate change and promptly teed him up in paragraph two, while instantly identifying her by party (something the paper consistently fails to do with Democrats in trouble):Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, says it is insensitive to discuss climate change in the midst of deadly storms. Tomás Regalado, the Republican mayor of Miami whose citizens raced to evacuate before Hurricane Irma, says if not now, when? For scientists, drawing links between warming global temperatures and the ferocity of hurricanes is about as controversial as talking about geology after an earthquake. But in Washington, where science is increasingly political, the fact that oceans and atmosphere are warming and that the heat is propelling storms into superstorms has become as sensitive as talking about gun control in the wake of a mass shooting. Ben Kirtman, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, said he believes failing to discuss climate change hurts Florida and the entire country. Dr. Kirtman and Dr. Berry are among a group of Florida scientists who confronted Governor Rick Scott in recent years for his refusal to acknowledge that human-made greenhouse gases are driving climate change. Last year they wrote a letter to then-candidate Donald J. Trump asking for a meeting to discuss the consequences of climate change in Florida. They said the Trump campaign never responded. In Florida, scientists say, Gov. Scott's aversion to even the words "climate change" have prompted scientists to self-censor their work. "If you write a proposal and it talks about fixing some infrastructure because of climate change, it's not going anywhere," Mr. Kirtman said. "You spend an awful lot of effort word-searching your document for the words 'climate' and 'change.' It's silliness." That is one reason many scientists maintain it is critical to use the megaphone that the dual devastation of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma has provided. People, they note, are finally paying attention. Friedman cited an obscure news source to make her case of benighted Republicans ignoring the obvious facts of climate change:	True

333	drudgereport	right_bias	2018-12-09	Thus, one well-worn tactic employed by those who would presume to tell the rest of us how to live, where to live, and how to work—all of the good of the planet, of course—is the alarmist study, making copious use of lies of omission and commission.	The sin of commission in the service of scaring middle class voters into doing that they're supposed to can be seen in an economic modeling study paid for by our federal tax dollars as well as underwritten by two billionaires who would be president: Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg.	And it's these three things: wealth, growth and technology, which allows humans to thrive on planet Earth, not $240 per gallon fuel taxes imposed by an elite that cares not for the masses.	So how do climate activists get their way?	This makes for scary headlines in the New York Times or CNN, but it is far from sound science or even good economics.		America Next? The City of Lights, Paris, has been illuminated in recent days by cars set alight by thousands of protesting "Yellow Vests"—largely middle class people who earn their living by driving or who commute to get to work. The cause of their ire is a scheduled 25 cents-per-gallon increase in gas taxes, and about 10 cents on diesel, to fight climate change. French President Macron, deeply unpopular, just reversed course on the new green tax—Parisians are already paying about $7.06 per gallon for gasoline, almost half of that in taxes. If Paris streets burned over a proposed 25 cents per gallon climate change tax, imagine the global conflagration over a $49 per gallon tax. That's what a United Nations special climate report calls for in 12 years, with a carbon tax of $5,500 per ton—equal to $49 per gallon of gasoline or diesel. That's about 100 times today's average state and federal motor fuels tax. By 2100, the U.N. estimates that a carbon tax of $27,000 per ton is needed—$240 per gallon—to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Of course, that isn't going to happen. The economic wreckage of such a punitive tax would plunge the global economy into a permanent depression—and that's assuming politicians could enact such huge tax increases over the will of their voters. Keep in mind that the unrest in France was triggered by a looming 25-cent hike, which is a little less than 10% more in taxes than French drivers already pay. To meet the $49 per gallon tax hike recommended by the U.N., fuel taxes in France would have to go up 17-fold. The violent protests in France were fueled by intense frustration felt by a middle class that sees itself squeezed. They don't earn enough to be part of the elite unconcerned with fuel taxes, but they work hard enough that they don't qualify for the generous welfare benefits handed out to the nation's poor and to newly arrived immigrants from Africa and the Middle East. Here in America, Republicans in Congress passed a resolution against carbon taxes over the summer while Democrats embraced the concept in their party platform. Some incoming members of the new Democratic majority in the House are calling to create a select committee to map out a "Green New Deal" that would move the U.S. toward using 100% renewable energy for the electric grid while guaranteeing jobs for everyone. In the meantime, opinion polls indicate that 54% of Americans do not believe global warming will cause major problems within their lifetimes. So how do climate activists get their way? Some openly talk of imposing authoritarian governance to override democratic institutions. Former NASA climate researcher James Hansen suggested in 2007 that "the democratic process does not work." Other scientists have called the threat of global warming the equivalent of war while calling for the crushing of dissent and the jailing of "deniers." Those who see climate change as a dire and urgent threat have some work to do to convince voters in the Western democracies to give up their way of life in exchange for unspecified benefits of a slightly less warm world—and that's assuming China, India and over a billion people in Africa can be convinced not to try to pull themselves out of poverty—something that may only be done with greater use of fossil fuels. Thus, one well-worn tactic employed by those who would presume to tell the rest of us how to live, where to live, and how to work—all of the good of the planet, of course—is the alarmist study, making copious use of lies of omission and commission. An example of the former can be seen in the new National Climate Assessment. The report's first chapter lists recent natural disasters, citing this summer's deadly Carr Fire in California as an example. But while the report seeks to link wildfire to climate change, it glosses over the real reason fires have grown in intensity and size: the 30 years of increased environmental restrictions on logging, brush clearance and preventive burns that caused a massive and dangerous fuel buildup—a problem that was predicted years ago and has nothing to do with global warming. The sin of commission in the service of scaring middle class voters into doing that they're supposed to can be seen in an economic modeling study paid for by our federal tax dollars as well as underwritten by two billionaires who would be president: Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg. Here we're told that the U.S. economy will take a 10% hit by 2100 unless we reduce our carbon emissions. Two problems, though: the authors assume the worst-case and least likely scenario, with average temperatures more than 14 degrees Fahrenheit hotter by 2100; and they derive two-thirds of their economic losses estimate by claiming a large amount of premature deaths due to the hotter temperatures. The latter claim is highly problematic as death rates in regions far hotter than in the U.S. aren't meaningfully different, when accounting for the standard of living. Why? People adapt rather easily. This makes for scary headlines in the New York Times or CNN, but it is far from sound science or even good economics. The bottom line is this: economic freedom—the kind you get with a large middle class—leads to prosperity, economic growth, and technological innovation. And it's these three things: wealth, growth and technology, which allows humans to thrive on planet Earth, not $240 per gallon fuel taxes imposed by an elite that cares not for the masses.	False
